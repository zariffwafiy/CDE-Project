OVERVIEW


ABOUT THIS REPORT
Our eventual goal is not just to create transparency in increasingly 
larger areas of our operations but also to link our actions and 
strategies to form a coherent picture of how we create value. As the 
leading integrated chemicals producer in Malaysia and one of the 
largest in Southeast Asia, PCG has a vast number of stakeholders 
representing varied groups, each of which is impacted by our business. 
We believe that via our enhanced reporting, we will be able to help 
all our stakeholders gain a better understanding of the way we 
manage issues that are important to them. 
Our financial statements, audited by KPMG PLT, have been prepared 
according to the requirements of the Malaysian Companies Act 2016 
and Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards (MFRS). Our corporate 
statements have been guided by the International Integrated 
Reporting Framework (IIRF), Main Market Listing Requirements 
(MMLR) of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (Bursa Malaysia) and 
the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 2017 (MCCG 2017). 
Meanwhile, we have referred to IPIECA's Oil and Gas Industry 
Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting, and FTSE4Good 
recommendations in crafting our Sustainability Statement.
OUR ANNUAL REPORTS 
ARE PRODUCED WITH ONE 
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE – TO 
PROVIDE OUR STAKEHOLDERS 
A BALANCED AND ACCESSIBLE 
ASSESSMENT OF OUR 
STRATEGY, PERFORMANCE, 
GOVERNANCE AND PROSPECTS. 
LAST YEAR, WE EMBARKED ON

This section forms the heart of our operational review. In it, our management share  
the challenges that face the industry and the strategies we have adopted to achieve our business 
goals of operational, commercial and innovation excellence.
OUR STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE


MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
MESSAGE FROM MD/CEO
Dear Shareholders,
We have pushed forward once again with our strategy to deliver greater shareholder value. Given 
the current global climate, the year presented its share of challenges. Yet, by all measures, it has 
been an exciting time for PCG, during which we achieved much that we can be proud of. This was 
the result of a winning combination of enhanced operational excellence and cost efficiencies with 
effective commercial strategies that allowed us to capitalise on market opportunities.
Pressing on with our growth strategy, we saw two major new projects come on-stream. PC Fertiliser
Sabah, our ammonia and urea plant in Sipitang, Sabah, began full and steady commercial operations
in May 2017. The Highly Reactive Polyisobutene (HR-PIB) plant has also successfully concluded the 
start up in January 2018. Meanwhile, at the Integrated Aroma Ingredients Complex being developed 
with our joint venture partner through BASF PETRONAS Chemicals Sdn Bhd in Gebeng, Pahang, the 
start-up has been initiated and is currently progressing in a step-wise approach.
DATUK SAZALI HAMZAH
Managing Director/ 
Chief Executive Officer
WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON  
OUR OPERATIONAL, COMMERCIAL AND  
INNOVATION EXCELLENCE, FORGING AHEAD

OUR STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE
OVERVIEW
impressive plant utilisation rate, above 90% for its 
first year of commercial operations, which is well 
above the norm for a plant of its kind. 
Finally, it is with great satisfaction to note that we 
achieved all our turnarounds on schedule and target 
cost without any incident, and have notched 154 
million safe man-hours at our site in PIC. Safety is 
our top priority and, as we grow, we are placing 
increased emphasis to enhance the integrity of 
our assets as well as the safety culture of our 
organisation to ensure nobody gets hurt at our 
premises. 
Our deep-rooted commitment to safety is reflective 
of a focused sense of responsibility towards 
people and the environment. We are a member 
of the global chemicals industry Responsible Care® 
initiative, that requires us to keep improving 
the environmental, health, security and safety 
performance of our facilities, processes and products. 
Further entrenching our environmental stewardship, 
our fatty alcohol ethoxylates (FAE) is now certified 
with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) 
for household and personal care applications. Our 
social citizenry, meanwhile, is underlined by the care 
extended to the many lives we touch, especially our 
employees and the communities that live around our 
facilities. 
WE CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, SECURITY AND 
SAFETY PERFORMANCE OF OUR FACILITIES, 
PROCESSES AND PRODUCTS
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
PC Fertiliser Sabah strengthens our basic chemicals 
portfolio, adding 1.9 million metric tonnes per 
annum (mtpa) of ammonia and urea to our 
nameplate capacity, making PCG the second largest 
producer of granular urea in Southeast Asia. 
Aroma ingredients from our complex in Gebeng have 
various applications in the fragrance and flavours 
sectors. We are particularly proud of this complex as 
it is the first of its kind outside Germany. And, once 
our HR-PIB plant is operational, we will be supplying 
50,000 mtpa of the chemical to manufacturers of 
high-performance fuels and lubricants.
Adding to the excitement of the year, we are 
entering into a possible partnership with Saudi 
Aramco which is proposing to acquire 50% of our 
stake in PRPC Polymers. This partnership holds 
many benefits, key amongst which is the long-term 
security of feedstock supply to the PRPC Refinery 
which in turn guarantees feedstock supply to the 
petrochemicals complex. The partnership would 
also allow for the sharing of investment risks and 
reduce our capital commitment whilst enabling us 
to leverage on Saudi Aramco’s experience in project 
management and operation of similar large scale 
and integrated chemicals complex. Consequently, this 
will pave the way for further collaboration with the 
world’s largest oil company.
PRPC Polymers and PC INA are the two operating 
companies we have set up in PIC to expand our basic 
and specialty chemicals portfolios. This year, we 
completed the Final Investment Decision (FID) for a 
250,000 tonne per year Isononanol plant. Isononanol 
is an oxo-alcohol, used mainly in the production of 
plasticiser that increases the flexibility of PVC, as well 
as making the PVC products safe for use.
Financially, we were able to capitalise on the 
strengthening oil market which, coupled with 
pockets of tight chemicals supply, led to an increase 
in price of certain bellwether products such as 
ethylene and methanol. Along with enhanced 
production volumes, this led to substantial growth 
in PCG’s revenue. Focused efforts to further improve 
our operational and cost efficiencies, meanwhile, 
resulted in a significant improvement in profit. It 
gives me great pleasure to share that, for the year 
under review, our revenue increased 26% to RM17.4 
billion while profit after tax grew 37% to RM4.4 
billion.  
I am particularly pleased that we maintained a 
high level of plant utilisation across the Group 
during the year under review despite four major 
statutory turnarounds. This was achieved via ongoing 
reliability enhancements, effective planning and 
better collaboration with key partners along the 
value chain. PC Fertiliser Sabah also recorded an 
Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC)
For more information on how we work to protect  
the environment and care for our internal and external 
stakeholders, please refer to pages 70 to 94 on 
Promoting Sustainability.

As we grow our capacity and 
diversify our product portfolio, we 
will not lose sight of sustaining 
outstanding operational, commercial 
and innovation excellence. Our focus 
on these three areas underpins 
our commitment to create value 
for all stakeholders. Our pursuit 
of excellence strengthens PCG at 
a fundamental level and provides 
the foundation to achieve the kind 
of sustainable growth we aspire to 
achieve.
GROWTH
Our business strategy has two 
focus areas: growing our basic 
petrochemicals portfolio hence 
increasing our competitive 
advantage through volume play; 
and selectively diversifying into 
derivatives as well as specialty 
chemicals and solutions to 
leverage higher margin products. 
This strategy is being realised 
through various growth projects, 
as mentioned earlier. With PC 
Fertiliser Sabah, we have increased 
our capacity to 12.7 million mtpa.

OVERVIEW
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
In 2017, we maintained the high 
levels of production volume 
achieved in 2016 through improved 
facilities and effective coordination 
with upstream operations. 
In May 2017, we began commercial 
operations at PC Fertiliser Sabah. 
Although new, it achieved a 
commendable first-year utilisation 
rate exceeding 90%. Leveraging 
on PCG’s operational excellence, 
we believe PC Fertiliser Sabah will 
be another key player among our 
assets. 
In supporting our joint venture 
company, BASF PETRONAS 
Chemicals Sdn Bhd, commision HR-
PIB and Aroma Ingredient Complex, 
our operations team has flawlessly 
commissioned the required facilities 
to deliver feedstock from PC MTBE.
Meanwhile, our petrochemical 
projects being developed at PIC 
are progressing well. We have 
already completed our manpower 
recruitment and grounding 
programme. The deployment of 
trained and experienced operations 
personnel to the project has 
been undertaken in phases and 
will be completed by the third 
quarter of 2018 as scheduled. 
Additionally, we are on track with 
the implementation of the requisite 
management systems, focusing 
on smooth start-up, operations, 
physical assets and state-of-art 
digital applications. 
To sustain a safe, reliable and 
efficient operation, we embark 
on a work process-based initiative 
named Operational Excellence 
Result 2 (OER2). This entails 
upgrading our management system 
and work processes to effectively 
replicate best practices across the 
Group while empowering our 
people to deliver superior results.

OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
In manufacturing, operational 
excellence is synonymous with 
safe operations at a high level of 
productivity. At PCG, we strive to 
achieve this through disciplined 
practices in HSE and manufacturing 
efficiency programmes, supported 
by stable feedstock supply. While 
focusing on operational excellence 
at existing plants, we have also 
seen product realisation from our 
growth projects, underlining our 
experience in project delivery and 
commercialisation. 
During the year, we delivered 
our planned maintenance 
activities, including the statutory 
turnarounds in a timely, safe and 
efficient manner. The turnarounds 
in Gebeng, Kertih and Labuan 
facilities were completed with 
better safety performance as 
compared to the past, as a 
result of reinforcing our safety 
culture and behaviours through 
programmes such as “Jom Patuh 
dan Tegur” (Let’s Comply and 
Intervene). Adopting best practices 
in turnaround, we managed to 
lower our turnaround costs by 
30%. Despite the heavy turnaround 
and maintenance schedule, we 
sustained a plant utilisation rate of 
above 90%. 
Reliable feedstock is critical 
to achieving exemplary plant 
utilisation rates, and is safeguarded 
at PCG through the priority given to 
supplier relationship management. 
We have established a higher level 
of collaboration with suppliers 
in planning and the provision 
of technical support to our 
operational activities throughout 
our value chain. Thus resulting 
in end-to-end value visibility and 
operational excellence.

COMMERCIAL AND INNOVATION EXCELLENCE
Commercial Excellence hinges on delivering superior value to our customers. It is 
about understanding our customers’ needs, and providing quality products that 
enhance their business. It is also about meeting our delivery obligations while 
optimising our cost-to-serve. 
Adopting the approach of looking through the customers’ lens, our team 
continued to pursue sales aggressively and achieved commendable results 
despite a challenging market, enabling PCG to record our best sales 
performance and attained a commendable feedback from customer satisfaction 
survey.
Key to our performance was being able to leverage our own high level of 
plant utilisation and ensure timely reliable supply to our customers. Over and 
above, we were able to meet additional demands from our customers affected 
by the outages of their other suppliers due to plants disruptions, as well as 
force majeures in the US Gulf Coast resulting from Hurricane Harvey. This was 
complemented by a general increase in demand for petrochemicals along with 
improving economies. 
No less than two-thirds of our production volume is channeled into Southeast 
Asia where our competitive value proposition is the strongest and therefore, 
relatively more cost effective to supply. 
Within the region, we optimised sales into higher value application of our 
products. For example, we increased our production of higher-value polymer 
grades which have applications in the manufacturing of plastic products, 
including flexible packaging, blow moulding, extrusion coating and roto 
moulding. 
One of our strategies is to continue collaborating with customers to deliver 
products more cost effectively and creating value for customers.
Recently we have also partnered with our domestic long-term customers 
to replace their imported prilled urea supply. We are well-positioned to 
significantly substitute imported prilled urea in the domestic market. 
To better serve our customers, we have been increasing our local presence in 
key international markets by setting up marketing and sales entities. During 
the year, we began operations in our third overseas subsidiary in Indonesia,  
adding to our existing bases in Thailand and China. Additionally, we have 
representative offices in Vietnam and the Philippines.
We continuously seek to establish presence in selected growing markets. 
Among others, we see much potential for fulfilling the growing demand for 
chemicals in the Indian subcontinent, hence, we are looking to strengthen our 
presence in this area.  
None of our marketing efforts would be effective if not for quality products, 
which has been the prerequisite of Commercial Excellence. We seek to further 
enhance our products’ premium through global sustainability endorsements 
such as the RSPO. During the year, we began the process of gaining RSPO 
certification and accreditation for our FAE.

PROMOTING SUSTAINABILITY
OUR STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE
OVERVIEW
In terms of cost reduction, we 
continued efforts to optimise our 
logistics through effective sourcing 
and utilisation of vessels, matching 
cargoes with the most cost efficient 
vessel size and reducing the number 
of trips made through better route 
planning, co-loading and co-mingling 
opportunities as well as delivery 
schedule optimisation. Utilising time 
charter has enabled us to optimise 
space and plan our routes better. This 
contributed to a reduction in our  
cost-to-serve; and sustaining our 
world class Order Fulfillment 
Reliability (OFR).  
The year also saw us establish our 
first Methanol storage tank outside 
the plant. This 12,000 MT storage 
tank capacity in Kertih will further 
enhance the security of supply to 
customers within the region. In 
Thailand, we are leasing a 700 MT 
storage tank for Butanol and 3,000 
MT storage tank for Methanol. 
This has enabled us to enter into 
the domestic distribution of these 
chemicals in Thailand. 
While creating greater logistics 
efficiencies and maximising value 
from our products for both our 
customers and PCG, we have also 
been working to establish our  
route-to-market in preparation 
for the large volume of chemicals 
that will come on-stream once 
our PIC projects reach commercial 
operations. 
As we drive greater Commercial 
Excellence, we further enhanced our 
people’s capability and competency 
to translate our strategies into 
action and results. Accordingly, we 
are empowering our personnel 
with the technical knowledge and 
business tools to enhance their sales 
effectiveness. 
Parallel to the Commercial 
Excellence, we are leveraging 
digitalisation to create more 
opportunities to unlock value. This 
year, we implemented a commercial 
performance dashboard, Data2act, 
which will enhance decision-making 
as real-time data become accessible 
anywhere and at any time.
As a chemicals company, innovation 
is critical in maintaining our 
competitive edge. It also underpins 
our research and development of 
new and niche applications. This is 
integral to our customer relationship 
management. We see ourselves as 
our customers’ partners, and work 
closely with them in the co-creation 
of products or applications that will 
enhance their business. 
We have developed a low water 
content monoethanolamine (MEA) 
for a customer in Taiwan for use in 
electronics applications. We also now 
supply a customised solution for mud 
cleaning in offshore drilling. In total, 
during the year, we commercialised 
four new solutions and co-created 
13 solutions with our customers, 
including customised emulsifiers, 
formulated surfactant for textile and 
rubber processing, shrink and stretch 
hood films and higher efficiency 
fertilisers.
OUTLOOK 2018
2018 promises to be another 
exciting year. Along with a gradually 
strengthening price of oil and steady 
improvements in global economies, 
we are optimistic of petrochemical 
prices holding their ground. 
Although we see improvements, we 
remain cautious and we will continue 
to build on our Operational, 
Commercial and Innovation 
Excellence initiatives to capture 
higher value from our focus markets. 
We are preparing for an even heavier 
turnaround schedule than we had 
in the year under review, with six 
planned programmes. Given our 
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
increasing experience, and excellent 
outcomes in 2017, we are confident 
of executing them efficiently 
thus maintaining an overall plant 
utilisation rate above 90%. We 
also look forward to the successful 
commercial operations of our Aroma 
Ingredients Complex and HR-PIB 
plants. Our investment in PIC is also 
progressing on schedule at about 
70% project completion and trained 
operations personnel are being 
mobilised to the site in stages.
To drive the commercial side of 
our business, we will continue 
advancing our PIC route-to-market 
strategies for polymers and glycols 
while developing new strategies for 
Isononanol. We will intensify our 
Innovation Excellence to develop 
more application solutions to meet 
customers’ needs. In addition, we 
will continue to utilise the digital 
platform to better serve our 
customers.
 
We have also been working 
assiduously to complete all our 
current growth projects on time, 
within budget and safely; and 
will continue to look for more 
opportunities to further strengthen 
our specialty and derivatives product 
portfolio to drive greater value for 
our shareholders, our customers and 
end-users globally.
The future is certainly looking bright 
for PCG, and with the continued 
support of our stakeholders I have 
every confidence that we will achieve 
our forward driving vision. I would 
like to take this opportunity to 
thank our Board of Directors for 
their dedicated efforts to ensure our 
sustainable growth. To members 
of the management, I would like 
to express my gratitude for their 
exemplary leadership. As for our 
employees, thank you for all the 
hard work and for enabling us to 
achieve our business goals. We 
are also immensely grateful to our 
shareholders, customers and business 
partners who contributed in their 
own way to PCG. To each of our 
stakeholders, let me say a collective 
‘terima kasih’. We truly value your 
contributions and seek to create 
equal value to you in return.

MESSAGE FROM CFO
The improving global economy in 2017 was positive for the petrochemicals 
industry on the whole, hence also for PCG. The increase in crude oil price, 
which averaged more than USD50 per barrel, coupled with escalating demand 
for petrochemicals and limited supply in certain markets led to a general 
growth in the price of petrochemicals. The most significant price increase was 
seen for methanol, which strengthened by 37%, while urea prices grew on 
average 11% year-on-year, and that for ethylene improved by 5%. Demand 
was particularly visible in Asia, our key market, partly due to reduced supply 
from the Middle East where producers saw most of their volumes taken up by 
increasing local demand. 
HIGHLIGHTS OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Against this backdrop coupled with higher sales volume, PCG Group achieved 
record financial performance since its listing in 2010.

PROMOTING SUSTAINABILITY
OUR STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE
OVERVIEW
The Group’s revenue increased by 
25.6% from RM13.86 billion in 2016 to 
RM17.41 billion as a result of various 
factors. Despite heavy statutory 
turnaround activities undertaken, 
and a concomitantly lower plant 
utilisation rate of 91.4% as compared 
to 95.7% in 2016, both our production 
and sales volumes grew following 
the commencement of commercial 
operations at PC Fertiliser Sabah in 
May 2017. Added to this, we were 
beneficiaries of an overall increase in 
the price of petrochemicals, along with 
the strengthening price of crude as well 
as strengthening of US Dollar.
The increase in price of crude, however, 
also led to a 35.9% increase in 
feedstock costs correspondingly. This 
contributed to a 29.1% increase in cost 
of revenue to RM11.02 billion against 
RM8.54 billion in 2016. Feedstock 
continued to constitute the largest 
component of the Group’s cost of 
revenue, making up 53.7% of our total 
costs for the year.
Balancing the increase in cost of 
revenue, our operating expenditure 
– namely our selling and distribution 
expenses, administration expenses 
and net other expenses – decreased 
by 10.3% to RM1.15 billion. This was 
primarily due to the recognition of 
a write-off of assets amounting to 
RM0.24 billion (or USD59 million) in 
2016 following cancellation of the 
elastomers project. Excluding the 
write-off, our operating expenditure 
would have been 10.8% or RM0.11 
billion higher in 2017 in order to 
support increase in sales volume, whilst 
certain expenses remained low through 
rigorous cost optimisation efforts. 
Increased sales volume, a favourable 
foreign exchange rate as well as higher 
spreads together contributed to a 
27.4% increase in Group profit before 
tax to RM5.24 billion. 
In addition, a lower effective tax rate 
has contributed to the significant 
increase to our net profit by 37.0% to 
RM4.41 billion. The Group’s effective 
tax rate for the year was 15.7%.
This meant that, even excluding the 
elastomers write-off in 2016, our 2017 
profit would have been 27.4% or 
RM0.95 billion higher. Along with the 
growth in profit, EBITDA increased by 
25.1% to RM6.62 billion. The Group’s 
EBITDA margin remained strong at 
38.0%.

OUR STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE


Olefins and Derivatives
During the year, Olefins & Derivatives (O&D)’s plant utilisation was lower at 93.6% from 100% in 2016 due to an increase in the number of 
statutory turnaround and planned maintenance activities. 
Despite the lower utilisation rate, and decrease in production and sales volumes, the segment saw a 16.4% increase in revenue to RM11.36 
billion. This was due primarily to a strengthening of product prices in tandem with the increase in crude oil prices. O&D’s profit after tax for 
the year increased by 28.3% to RM2.77 billion. Excluding the elastomers project write-off in 2016, however, our profit would have been 15.3% 
higher. EBITDA grew by RM0.29 billion or 7.7% to RM4.10 billion, mainly driven by higher spreads and a stronger US Dollar. 
Fertilisers and Methanol
As with O&D, heavy statutory turnaround activities led to a decrease in plant utilisation rate in our Fertilisers and Methanol (F&M) segment 
from 92.5% in 2016 to 90.1%. This was, however, more than compensated for by increased production and sales volumes following the 
commencement of commercial operations at PC Fertiliser Sabah. 
With PC Fertiliser Sabah’s contributions, revenue increased by 45.9% to RM6.17 billion. Meanwhile, profit after tax for the year grew by 
61.1% to RM0.61 billion due to improved prices, higher volumes and a stronger US Dollar against the Ringgit. These factors, along with better 
spreads, lent to a significant 68.1% increase in EBITDA to RM2.57 billion.

OUR STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE


Cash Flow 
Although the Group’s cash and cash 
equivalents was 9.8% or RM0.73 
billion less than in 2016, it remained 
at a healthy level of RM6.67 billion. 
We saw a higher cash outflow for 
investing activities mainly due to 
our investment in petrochemicals 
projects in PIC. At the same time, 
there was a decrease in financing 
activities as a result of net settlement 
of forward exchange contract on 
shareholders’ loan by PCG Holding 
Company in 2016 and lower dividends 
paid to non-controlling interests 
of subsidiaries. This was partially 
offset by higher dividends paid to 
shareholders. 
Meanwhile, we saw an increase in net 
cash inflows from operating activities 
mainly contributed by higher net cash 
generated from operations in tandem 
with the increase in EBITDA. 
CAPEX 
The Group’s CAPEX for the year which 
was fully funded internally, stood at 
RM4.62 billion mainly attributed to 
the developments in petrochemicals 
projects in PIC as well as operational 
requirements. 
OUR FOCUS IN 2017 
Cost Optimisation
In an environment that remained 
challenging with low crude oil prices 
and subdued demand, PCG’s focus 
on operational and commercial 
excellence; as well as rigourous cost 
optmisation effort helped us maintain 
costs at low levels.
 
Optimisation of Internal Funds
 
We revised our minimum cash balance 
by optimising the working capital 
requirements for all PCG subsidiaries. 
Daily cash flow movements were 
analysed to ascertain the optimum 
level of working capital, while we 
standardised the working capital 
management as well as capital 
expenditure requirements in all 
subsidiaries.
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
Foreign Exchange Management
We ensure the Group has sufficient 
ringgit to fund our growth projects 
by adhering to the Foreign 
Exchange Management Guidelines 
in PETRONAS’ Corporate Financial 
Policy. Further strengthening these 
guidelines, we have established 
immediate and medium-term 
measures to manage our forex 
exposure. In the immediate term, 
PCG will continue to hedge our USD 
exposure based on actual cash calls 
from our projects. In the medium-
term, we will either build up and 
retain USD proceeds in the Group 
for future obligations, or hedge 
to predetermine the conversion 
rate based on long-term cash 
commitments, depending on the 
market and the viability of the two 
options.
Strengthened Governance
We continue to ensure that our key 
internal control systems are adequate 
and effective at all times via self-
attestation guided by our Financial 
Control Framework. At the same 
time, we have standardised and 
aligned the finance work process in 
all subsidiaries to ensure consistency 
in practices and operating discipline, 
while continuously enhancing the 
retention and sharing of knowledge. 
Our policies are geared to ensure 
accurate accounting and to produce 
reliable financial statements.
LOOKING FORWARD
Moving into 2018, our key priority is 
to maintain a solid balance sheet and 
manage our cash prudently to be able

In the face of increasing 
shortage of arable land, our 
urea contributes to increased 
crop yields which supports 
more efficient food production 
for the growing population.
Our MTBE caters well 
to the rapid rise in the 
automotive industry fueled 
by the increased affluence of 
consumers in this region. 
Our polymers can 
be customised 
to meet the 
robust growth 
of automotive

the growing 
higher mobility 
requirement for 
light and smart 
packaging.
Our methanol, 
ethanolamines and 
ethoxylates will capture 
the huge demand 
growth from the 
expanding middle class 
for cosmetics and other 
personal care products.
Our glycols and paraxylene 
are used in the production 
of polyester in textiles 
industry to cater for 
increasing urban

OUR STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE


UNDERSTANDING OUR RISKS
We operate in a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world with several issues and risks arising from product oversupply, 
slower than anticipated demand growth, lower product prices reflecting crude oil as well as heightened geopolitical conflict, nationalism and 
protectionism.  
Because the external environment is unpredictable, we recognise the need to continuously identify emerging risks. We undertake risk profiling 
in accordance with PCG Risk Management Framework and Guideline where we identify, evaluate and monitor risks that could potentially impact 
PCG’s bottom line as early as possible. These are determined based on the complexities, hazards and integrated nature of our manufacturing and 
business processes. 
Identified critical risks are closely monitored and managed via specific mitigation plans to minimise adverse impacts to our business and growth 
strategies. Key Risk Indicators are identified to facilitate the monitoring of risks and provide early warning signals on potential risk escalation.
The mitigation plans and key risk indicators are reported to our management and Board.

Asset & Reputation
2. Non-sustainable feedstock or utilities for reliable and  
flawless plant operations 
Operational Excellence

Link to Material Matters Impacting Our Strategy
Operational Excellence
HSE incidents are an inherent risk in manufacturing facilities, 
with the highest impact coming from process safety incidents. 
Risk exposures include fire, explosion, loss of primary 
containment (LOPC) and oil or chemical spills. Probable 
root causes include non-compliance with plant operating 
procedures and standards or regulatory requirements, poor 
implementation of process safety as well as human error. We 
also ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, including 
license to operate manufacturing facilities that impact our 
assets and reputation.
This risk is inherent to PCG due to the complexity and integrated 
nature of our manufacturing process and high dependence on 
feedstock and utilities from external parties.
 
While our integrated operations have synergistic advantages, we 
are at risk of operational interruptions if one or more plants in 
the integrated chain fails to operate reliably.
 
In addition, PCG relies on shared infrastructures. Any disruption to 
these shared infrastructures may adversely affect our production 
and ultimately impact delivery of end-products to customers.
• 
Strengthen HSE governance via Mandatory Control 
Framework (MCF) compliance
• 
Focus on execution of HSE Management System (HSEMS) and 
Process Safety Management (PSM)
• 
Develop competencies and communicate HSE policies as well 
as processes to all PCG staff and contractors, with tracked 
action plans
• 
Implement and monitor HSE Zero Tolerance (ZeTo) rules
• 
Strengthen Felt Leadership 
• 
Collaborate with feedstock and utilities suppliers for 
sustainable supply to our plants
• 
Monitor feedstock and end-products inventories on a 
monthly basis
• 
Implement Business Recovery Plans (BRPs) and Business 
Continuity Plans (BCPs) to restore normal operations and 
business continuity, should there be prolonged interruption

Sustainability Statement from pages 82 to 86)

3. Cyclicality of petrochemical industry leading to adverse market

Operational Excellence, 
Commercial Excellence &  
Growth Porfolio
Starting with the downward pressure on Brent price since 
end 2014, the price gap between naphtha and ethylene for 
naphtha-based producers is decreasing and heightening 
the competition on olefins, glycols, derivatives and polymer 
products. The decreasing crude oil price also affects demand 
for MTBE and methanol, potentially impacting our ability to 
sustain revenue.
With numerous growth projects in the pipeline, PCG needs to 
be cautious in its spending. In addition, any delay in project 
completion would further impact PCG’s financial performance.
• 
Implement asset management and reliability initiatives to 
ensure production volume targets are met
•

Operational Excellence, 
Commercial Excellence &  
Growth Porfolio
With several capital projects committed, PCG is exposed to project 
delay, cost overruns and inability to meet contractual volume.
 
We need to ensure our projects are completed according to scope 
and within schedule and budget with zero HSE issues, to capture 
maximum value.
 
Critical factors that can ensure project targets are met include 
good performance by contractors and sub-contractors, effective 
project management, effective operation readiness programme 
and good control of the joint-venture project management.
• 
Implement initiatives to strengthen project and contractor 
management
• 
Comply with PPMS framework and guidelines
• 
Monitor projects at various levels, up to the Board
•

ANNUAL REPORT 2017
OUR STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE


INVESTOR RELATIONS 
Crude oil prices improved 17.7% 
during the year largely due to 
production controls. The market 
took a turn after the benchmark 
Brent crude price hit its lowest of 
USD45 per barrel in June on news of 
increasing US stockpiles and rising 
production in key parts of the world. 
Exporting countries’ agreement 
to extend production cuts into 
2018, compounded by unexpected 
production outages, led to crude oil 
prices rallying in the second half of the 
year to close at USD67 per barrel at 
the end of 2017.
In Malaysia, gross domestic product 
(GDP) increased significantly due to 
robust exports, supported by demand 
growth in the electrical and electronics 
sector and a relatively weak Ringgit. 
The Malaysian currency, nevertheless, 
gained strength from RM4.491 against 
the US Dollar at the start of the year 
to RM4.061 by the end of 2017.
The FTSE Bursa Malaysia Kuala Lumpur 
Composite Index (FBM KLCI) trended 
up during the year alongside steady 
economic growth. Opening at 1,642 
points, the index climbed steadily 
throughout the year. Its upward 
movement was supported by strong 
inflow from foreign investors, positive 
economic indicators and the relatively 
weak Ringgit, making local equities 
a favourite among foreign investors. 
The FBM KLCI closed the year at 
1,797 points, improving 9.4% from its 
opening.
PCG’s share price gained 10.3% from 
RM6.98 per share, its opening price on 
2 January 2017 to RM7.70 per share by 
year-end close. Average Daily Traded 
Volume (ADTV2) for the year was 7.81 
million units, 1.65 million units higher 
than the 6.16 million recorded in 2016. 
Foreign shareholding increased 2.8% 
to 11.0% during the year. 
2018 kicked off in expansion mode 
with higher growth registered across 
the US, Eurozone and emerging 
markets. The price of crude oil has 
remained above USD65 per barrel, 
boosted by robust global demand and 
supported by promising economic 
growth.  
“SYNCHRONISED  
ECONOMIC RECOVERY”  
BEST DESCRIBES THE GROWTH EXPERIENCED BY 
BOTH DEVELOPED AND EMERGING MARKETS IN 2017. 
ENTHUSIASM OVER THE US’ PRO-BUSINESS AGENDA, 
EUROZONE’S RISE TO EXPANSION AND CHINA’S TIGHTENING 
POLICY TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH WERE 
INDICATORS OF IMPROVED MARKET SENTIMENT.

The local bourse breached the 1,800 
level early in the new year on positive 
sentiments and optimism on the 
country’s growth and trade data. 
Through this, PCG’s share price has 
continued its upward momentum, 
hitting a high of RM8.19, then 
tapering to close at RM8.09 on 28 
February. The counter remains among 
the top 10 on the FBM KLCI, with 
a market capitalisation of RM64.7 
billion.
INVESTOR RELATIONS
PCG recognises the importance of 
effective communications with our 
shareholders as well as the general 
public. As such, we have tailored our 
Investor Relations programme to 
promote consistent and transparent 
sharing of material and accurate 
information in a timely manner, in 
accordance with Bursa Malaysia’s 
MMLR and Disclosure Guidelines.
We are committed in providing 
relevant and accurate information to 
our shareholders and stakeholders, 
mindful of the legal and regulatory 
framework governing the release 
of material and price-sensitive 
information. The Investor Relations 
team strives continuously to improve 
PCG’s visibility in both the domestic 
and international capital markets, 
and to address investor interests and 
concerns in a timely and appropriate 
manner.
In 2017, PCG engaged with more than 
100 key shareholders, analysts and 
fund managers through face-to-face 
meetings, conference calls, analysts’ 
briefings, plant visits, participation in 
roadshows as well as capital market 
conferences.
QUARTERLY ANALYSTS'

calls. These briefings are accessible to 
both local and foreign participants, 
facilitating management discussion

PROMOTING SUSTAINABILITY
CHAPTER
We are committed to operating in a manner that meets the expectations of our stakeholders. This 
forms the core of our sustainability agenda. In these pages, we provide a clear account of actions 
taken to balance our economic with social and environmental obligations.
PROMOTING SUSTAINABILITY


SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT 
At PCG, we understand the 
importance of establishing strong 
relationships based on trust and 
respect with our various stakeholders 
as we recognise that their support is 
critical to our long-term success. This 
is reflected in a robust governance 
framework which ensures we 
uphold a high level of integrity and 
transparency in all our dealings 
and interactions. In presenting a 
Sustainability Statement in our 
annual report, we aim to create 
clarity in communicating our actions 
and activities to our stakeholders on 
matters that count.
Through this report, we underline 
the values that guide us as we fulfill 
the expectations of our increasing 
number of stakeholders. With regards 
to our customers, we strive to provide 
quality products that fulfill their 
requirements. In our dealings with 
suppliers and business partners, we 
adhere to best practices that ensure 
fairness and that also help them 
grow their businesses in a sustainable 
manner. Internally, we provide an 
engaging and dynamic environment 
in which employees are encouraged 
to develop professionally and are 
rewarded for performance. 
We also believe in supporting 
the local communities that live 
in areas surrounding our plants. 
Integrating ourselves in these 
local communities and providing 
environment, education and social 
support reinforced our social license 
to operate, while building our brand 
equity.
Because of the nature of our business, 
our sustainability platform extends 
to protecting the environment. 
We acknowledge the urgency of 
global efforts to mitigate and 
manage climate change as well as 
environmental protection. We are 
playing our part by undertaking 
numerous initiatives to reduce our 
greenhouse gas emissions, minimise 
waste and conserve natural resources.
In producing this Sustainability 
Statement, we are guided by both 
Bursa Malaysia’s Sustainability 
Framework, IPIECA’s ‘Oil and Gas 
Industry Guidance on Voluntary 
Sustainability Reporting’ as well 
as FTSE Environmental, Social & 
Governance (ESG) assessment 
indicators. Contents of the report are 
based on a materiality assessment, 
which determined those issues that 
are most important to us and our 
stakeholders. Where possible, we have 
provided quantitative data to support 
our narrative. Where such data cannot

PART OF OUR DNA. 
be presented, we are implementing 
systems and processes that will 
enable us to measure and monitor 
our sustainability performance. Our 
sustainability disclosure had gone 
through external peer review and 
independent internal verification 
to ensure the effectiveness of our 
internal controls and standard 
operating procedures. 
THE BOUNDARIES OF OUR 
REPORTING 
Data for this report has been 
compiled from all the manufacturing 
subsidiaries in which PCG has more 
than 50% ownership. As we have 
operational control over these 
companies, they have adopted our 
approach in managing sustainable 
development focus areas. This report 
covers the period from 1 January 2017 
to 31 December 2017. There were no 
significant changes to our reporting 
boundaries during this year.

 Our Sustainability Materiality Assessment Matrix
 
SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT 
IDENTIFYING OUR SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS AREAS
Key to the development of a sustainability report is to determine areas of operations and activities that have the greatest impact on both PCG 
as well as our stakeholders. To do this, SDWC conducted materiality assessment once in every two years with the last exercise being carried out 
in 2016 using the following four steps methodology.
PRIORITISATION OF 
SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS AREAS
Each sustainability issue was then plotted 
on a sustainability materiality assessment 
matrix. The issues that fall within the 
shaded areas of the matrix were prioritised 
for initial reporting as they are significant 
to both PCG and our stakeholders. 
These issues represent PCG’s Sustainability 
Focus Areas, and are described in detail in 
subsequent sections of this Report.
IDENTIFICATION OF 
SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES
The SDWC identified sustainability issues 
that are relevant to the petrochemicals 
and oil & gas industry. This list of issues 
were obtained from IPIECA’s ‘Oil and 
Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary 
Sustainability Reporting’. Comprehensive 
materiality assessment had been done 
internally. At the same time, we also 
engaged with external stakeholders to 
seek feedback on issues that matter to 
them through face-to-face engagements 
and surveys.
ASSESSING THE SIGNIFICANCE 
OF EACH ISSUE TO 
STAKEHOLDERS 
In analysing the sustainability issues 
surfaced during Step 1, we were able to 
categorised them within our sustainability 
focus areas. The analysis takes into 
account the level of stakeholder interest 
and its significance to our business and 
industry. 
ASSESSING THE SIGNIFICANCE 
OF EACH ISSUE TO PCG
Subsequently, the issues were assessed to 
determine their significance to PCG. The 
criteria used for this assessment include: 
a) significance of the risk posed by the issue; 
b) importance of the issue to our company’s 
growth; 
c) our ability to contribute to the issue;
d) alignment with our company’s values, 
goals and policies.

SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT 
ENERGY USE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
Greenhouse gases (GHG) have been identified as the most significant contributor to climate change over the past decades. Of these gases, 
carbon dioxide (CO2) is by far the most prevalent, and is released as a result of various chemical reactions among which the burning of fuel for 
energy (including electricity) is key. 
More than 75% of our total GHG emissions is due to energy consumed to run our plants. We strive to manage and minimise our consumption 
via an Energy & Loss Management System (ELMS) which emphasises continuous improvements through a systematic process. By using energy 
efficiently, we also stand to benefit from lower operating costs.
RESPONSIBILITY  
TO THE 
ENVIRONMENT
AS A CHEMICALS MANUFACTURER, WE  
UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO 
ENSURE OUR OPERATIONS LEAVE MINIMAL IMPACT 
TO THE ENVIRONMENT. 
Our environmental responsibility extends to ensuring we use 
natural resources such as hydrocarbons and water as efficiently as 
possible, and that we manage all waste in a manner that is mindful 
of the natural environment and the local communities. 
OUR ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES EXTEND 
TO THE REFORESTATION AND REHABILITATION 
OF MANGROVE HABITATS, INVOLVING THE 
PARTICIPATION OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

RECYCLING OF CO2 IN OUR 
UREA PLANT
At PC Fertiliser Kedah, one of 
our urea manufacturing facilities, 
CO2 released as a by-product of 
fuel combustion, is recycled for 
use in the production of urea. 
The plant’s primary reformer is 
used to convert natural gas into 
syngas. Combustion of fuel gas to 
generate the heat required by the 
reformer generates exhaust gases 
rich in CO2.
Its CO2 Recovery Unit captures 
about 30% of the gas from the 
primary reformer and recycled as 
feedstock in the production of 
urea.

FRESHWATER CONSUMPTION
Our operations are heavily dependent 
on water, which is used to generate 
steam as well as for cooling and 
cleaning purposes. Because it is a 
vital and limited natural resource, 
we strive to use water efficiently, 
hence minimise waste. All activities 
involving water are closely monitored, 
in line with PETRONAS’ Guidelines 
on Water Practices (WAPS) which 
defines the operating conditions and 
maintenance practices for efficient 
water use. The list of WAPS guidance 
documents that are available is shown 
below:
We measure our water consumption efficiency in terms of water intensity, 
which reflects the volume of water used per tonne of product. This year, our 
water withdrawal intensity was 3% higher than in 2016 as a result of the 
commissioning of PC Fertiliser Sabah in 2017 and statutory shutdowns of several 
plants during the year.

SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT 
COOLING WATER CONSERVATION  
AT PC AROMATICS
PC Aromatics, similar to other manufacturing 
facilities, requires large quantities of water to cool 
high-temperature equipment. Cooling towers are 
used to reduce the temperature of heated water so 
that it can be reused to cool critical plant equipment.
PC Aromatics has managed to reduce the volume of makeup water 
it consumes, and blowdown water discharged, by increasing the 
concentration of minerals in the recirculated water by 60%-100% without 
scaling. This was achieved by tightly controlling other parameters such 
as the acidity and conductivity of the water and ensuring zero chlorine 
content.
By reducing the quantity of makeup water consumed by the cooling water 
system, the water withdrawal intensity for this facility improved by 26%, 
saving approximately 400,000 m3 of water in 2017. This is equivalent to the 
volume of water in more than 160 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

utilise pollution control equipment. As an added safety measure, we monitor 
the quality of air and water surrounding our plants. 
During the year, we saw an increase in NOx emissions compared to 2016 due 
to the commissioning of PC Fertiliser Sabah in May 2017. Meanwhile, our air 
emissions intensity also increased due to statutory shutdowns.
To monitor our water effluent, we 
analyse 31 different parameters to 
ensure they meet legal and internal 
standards. One of the key parameters 
analysed is its chemical oxygen 
demand (COD), which tells us how 
much organic matter is released 
into surrounding waters. All water 
discharged by PCG is channelled 
into rivers and the sea, and not to 
enclosed water bodies.
During the year, we saw a reduction 
in COD loading compared to 2016. 
This was contributed by the higher 
number of statutory shutdowns and 
through plant optimisation efforts in 
2017.

REAL-TIME AIR EMISSIONS MONITORING SYSTEM AT PC MTBE
We operate large-capacity fuel burning equipment (FBE) such as boilers and turbines to generate the steam and electricity required by 
our facilities. Although these equipment run on clean fuel (gas), they remain a key source of air emissions. We monitor these emissions 
to be able to identify and resolve potential problems quickly before they escalate.
Stepping up our efforts, we collaborated with PETRONAS to be the first to install PETRONAS-Predictive Emissions Monitoring 
System (P-PEMS). P-PEMS collects real-time operations data from the FBE, then uses a mathematical model to accurately predict the 
concentration of air pollutants emitted. P-PEMS averts the need to install expensive air emission analysers and sampling probes, which 
would also require additional maintenance to ensure their reliability. 
We first ran a pilot project using P-PEMS in a boiler at PC MTBE in 2015 to monitor its NOx and carbon monoxide emissions. In 2016, 
the system was installed in PC MTBE’s remaining two boilers. As of 2017, all three P-PEMS systems have been audited and found to 
produce consistent accurate air emissions data, which are transmitted in real-time to the Department of Environment (DOE). 
We are now identifying other FBE where P-PEMS could be installed, with plans to complete all installations by the year 2019.

WASTE GENERATION
Proper waste management is integral to minimising the environmental impact of our operations. We strive to be efficient in the consumption 
of natural resources and to minimise waste, especially hazardous waste; by reducing, reusing, recycling and/or recovering waste. A large 
portion of PCG’s hazardous waste is recycled as fuel, solvents, lubricants or other beneficial products. Where possible, spent catalysts used in 
our processes are sent to specialised facilities where precious metals are extracted from this waste.
As part of our waste management process, we quantify and inventorise all hazardous waste, which is stored safely in dedicated areas within 
each manufacturing site before being transported to government licensed waste facilities for appropriate treatment.
In 2017, we maintained our average waste recycling rate at above 80%. Moving forward, we will continue to strive to reduce, reuse, recycle 
and recover our hazardous waste.

product from the manufacturing of butyl glycol ether.
In an effort to create more value from this by-product, PC Derivatives sells BPG as an 
additive in oilfield chemicals, rather than incinerate it. This initiative generates the 
following benefits:
• 
Reduces the quantity of waste incinerated
• 
Reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emitted due to the incineration of BPG

EMERGENCY AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT EXERCISES
PCG conducts emergency exercises to evaluate our manufacturing facilities’ internal emergency response and preparedness. Such exercises also 
test our coordination with external emergency supporters including the Fire and Rescue Department, Police Department, Civil Defence Force, 
local medical facilities and neighbouring plants. We were encouraged by the efficiency with which our plants’ Emergency Management Team 
(EMT) and Emergency Response Team (ERT) members responded and handled the three major emergency exercises carried out over the year, 
with support from relevant sections within PCG and PETRONAS.
1 
Drug and Alcohol Test Inspection - Assurance that drivers are not 
influenced by drugs or alcohol while driving. Performed randomly at the 
loading point, on the road or at the service provider’s depot.
2 
Vehicle Inspection - Assurance that only road-fit vehicles are used. 
Inspection is performed prior to loading. Unqualified vehicles are rejected or 
sent for repairs.
3 
On-the-Road Surveillance - Assurance that drivers follow all traffic rules & 
regulations. Monitoring is conducted by deploying a surveillance team on the 
road, or through in-cab cameras.
4 
In-cab Surveillance - Assurance that drivers apply appropriate driving 
techniques. An assessor sits inside the vehicle as it is being driven for 
observation and to test the driver’s knowledge of defensive driving.
5 
Driver’s Logbook - Assurance that drivers have required hours of rest time. 
Inspection of drivers’ rest time is performed at the loading point prior to 
loading. Drivers not meeting the required hours of rest will be asked to be 
replaced.
6 
In-Vehicle Monitoring System (IVMS) Surveillance - Assurance that 
drivers follow the approved routing, road regulations, speed limit and other 
safety parameters.

PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP
Product Stewardship addresses the management of risks and improvement of the performance of a product in the fields of safety, health 
and the environment during its entire life cycle. It entails systematically assessing, controlling and communicating the HSE and social impacts 
of our products and packaging while maximising their economic benefits. We embrace Product Stewardship and have made a conscious and 
voluntary decision to implement programmes to ensure safety of stakeholders involved in our development, production, transportation, use 
and disposal. 
Our commitment to Product Stewardship is codified through endorsement of the chemical industry’s Responsible Care® programme. We also 
engage with professionals within the industry and trade associations to keep abreast of trends, and feel privileged to be able to share our 
knowledge with government agencies to help shape new laws and regulations.
‘ZERO FIRE ZERO LEAK’ PROGRAMME AT PC MTBE
PC MTBE has implemented a ‘Zero Fire Zero Leak’ (ZFZL) programme to reduce the number of minor process safety incidences, thus 
preventing the potential occurrence of major process safety incidences. Besides incorporating PETRONAS’ existing systems to ensure 
asset integrity, ZFZL focuses on the following three critical equipment that typically have higher process safety risks: piping joints, valves 
and insulated piping risks.
Piping joints and valves that have higher risk of leaks have been identified and are inspected weekly. The tightness of bolts on joints is 
now customised according to the material used. During plant turnarounds, systematic quality assurance and control were implemented 
during installation and repair works for joints and valves. This entire process was documented for future reference. For insulated piping, 
periodic inspections are made and systematic maintenance carried out. New piping materials are also being tested that reduce the 
likelihood of corrosion.
PC MTBE’s ZFZL team members act as agents to promote ZFZL among all PC MTBE employees. Continuous efforts to strengthen the ZFZL 
programme led to a 62% year-on-year reduction in the number of minor process safety incidences at the plant.

LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME
We have a structured and progressive leadership programme that starts with 
helping individuals develop leadership skills and continues until individuals 
become competent in setting their own goals, managing challenges and risks, 
and recognising their own strengths as well as areas for further development.
To assist the transition of new managers into leadership roles, conditioning 
programmes are introduced to enhance self-awareness, equip them with 
essential knowledge as well as key skills to lead themselves and others in 
bringing about positive change in the business. Ultimately, our leaders are 
trained to become strategic implementers.
SUCCESSION MANAGEMENT
Succession planning is critical for the continuity of our business, ensuring we 
have a ready pipeline of talent to fill in leadership gaps in a timely manner. 
While preference is given to internal talent, we also have access to suitable 
talent from the wider PETRONAS Group.
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING
PCG provides technical and non-technical industrial training to undergraduates 
in areas related to their academic backgrounds. In 2017, 314 students 
participated in industrial training with PCG.

SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT 
WORKFORCE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
We seek to bring on board a diverse workforce for the value that different 
opinions and perspectives bring in broadening our viewpoints and enhancing 
our decision making. Company-wide, female employees make up 18.5% 
of our total workforce. This is influenced by the largely male dominated 
representation in our plants. At the Board level, gender balance is amplified 
with women making up 25% of our Board of Directors.
To create a more balanced gender representation, we have various policies 
that support women and promote their career progression. Other than the 
opportunity to make use of the Flexible Work Option to suit their schedules, 
working mothers have access to nursing facilities within our headquarters and 
plants. We also encourage women executives to participate in the PETRONAS 
Leading Women Network to learn from other successful professional women as 
well as to benefit from networking.
FLEXIBLE WORK HOURS
In July, PCG implemented the Flexible Work Option introduced by the Group, 
providing flexibility as to when they start and end work on a daily basis. They 
also enjoy a Compressed Work Week, which allows them to finish work at noon 
on the fifth day of the week upon completing the required 39 hours for the 
week, subject to approval from their immediate superior. These flexi options 
provide our employees with greater autonomy over their time, enabling them 
to better balance their work-life obligations. 
EMPLOYEE RETENTION & CONTRACT STAFF
During the year, our staff turnover rate dropped further to 0.9% from 1.0% in 
2016. We also saw a reduction in percentage of contract staff, from 5.1% to 
4.1%. This is a result of increased focus on empowering our full-time employees 
and reducing our dependency on contract staff.

ANTI-CORRUPTION
Underlining all our social engagements is a deeply entrenched business ethic 
that has zero tolerance for bribery or corruption. To uphold a high level of 
professionalism and integrity organisation-wide, all employees receive training 
on PETRONAS’ Code of Conduct and Business Ethics. In the last quarter of 
2017, we further strengthened our corporate values by requiring all senior 
management to declare their assets. In addition to ensuring high ethical 
standards among our senior management, it demonstrates leadership by 
example, reinforcing transparent governance in PCG.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT
Dear Shareholders,
Effective Corporate Governance is integral to 
the successful delivery of our business goals 
for our diverse stakeholders. How we work 
is as important as what we do. PCG operates 
within established governance framework 
designed to foster transparency, integrity and 
an informed approach to risk management 
across our business worldwide. We have 
set good standards of behavior we expect 
from everyone in PCG. The Board is pleased 
to inform that the Group is committed 
to complying with the provisions of the 
Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 
2017 (MCCG 2017). 
Good governance is not just about 
compliance with the rules and regulations; 
it is about our culture, behaviours and how 
we do our business. The Board has a vital role 
to play by ensuring that it sets the tone for 
the rest of the organisation. This overview 
report includes practical insights into how 
our governance framework underpins and 
supports our business and the decisions 
we make every day. For the period under 
review, PCG has essentially complied with the 
recommended practices of MCCG 2017. The 
status of the Company’s application to MCCG 
2017 is reported in our Corporate Governance 
Report, which is accessible  
to the public at PCG’s website  
www.petronaschemicals.com. 
This Corporate Governance Overview 
Statement should be read together with the 
Corporate Governance Report.
Leadership
The Board’s role is to review and guide the 
strategy for the Group, as well as ensuring 
the appointment of the right leaders and 
effective implementation of the strategy. 
At the same time, the Board also monitors 
business performance and ensures the timely 
and effective assessment and management of 
business risks. Our goal is to build an enduring 
and profitable business admired by customers 
and stakeholders whilst achieving strong 
returns for our shareholders. As the Group’s 
strategy continues to evolve, the Board is 
focused on ensuring that the Group remains 
on course in achieving its target and long-
term value creation. 
Effectiveness
Every year, under the purview of the Nomination 
and Remuneration Committee, a Board 
Effectiveness evaluation is conducted through 
a process which consists of a Board, Board 
Committee, Peer and Self Evaluation. The 
evaluation was once again positive and I was 
particularly pleased with the quality of support 
and challenge provided by the Non-Executive 
Directors to the Management team and the 
atmosphere of constructive debate around 
the boardroom table. The evaluation enabled 
the Board to reflect on areas for focus and 
improvement.
Within our business, we continue to focus 
on creating connections among employees 
of diverse backgrounds through various 
engagement programmes and townhalls. We 
believe that creating these connections lead 
to employees feeling included and valued 
and will safeguard our diverse workforce. 
Creating these connections between our 
employees goes to the heart of our culture. 
PCG is not unique in having a strong culture, 
but we believe our culture is unique. We 
value openness and fairness. Our employees 
are committed and loyal and take pride in 
their work and are proud to work for PCG. 
There is a trust and a real sense of family 
and community between PCG employees 
and, importantly, a belief that coming to 
work is fulfilling. The diverse make up of our 
workforce combined with the empowerment 
accorded to them, provides us with agility 
and leads to the creativity and innovation for 
which PCG is renowned.
Accountability
The Board spent time discussing the areas of 
risk assessment and risk management, and 
internal control systems as well as assessing 
the long term prospects of the Group. In 
addition, we continue to improve the quality 
of our Financial Reporting and in turn, 
to ensure the independence, quality and 
effectiveness of the external audit process.
Relations with shareholders
As Chairman, I am responsible for effective 
communication with shareholders and for 
ensuring that the Board understands the 
views of our shareholders. During the year,
I have met and spoken with many 
shareholders at our Annual General Meeting 
(AGM). Immediately after the conclusion 
of the AGM, the Company holds a press 
conference with the media and any materials 
distributed during the press conferences are 
published on the Company’s website. The 
general view is that, our shareholders support 
our strategy and are very comfortable with 
our approach to corporate governance.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE
THE BOARD
INDEPENDENT NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
The Independent Non-Executive Directors’ role is central to an effective and accountable Board 
structure. They constructively challenge the Executive Director and scrutinise the performance 
of Management in meeting agreed goals and objectives. They help develop and monitor the 
delivery of the strategy within the risk and control framework set by the Board. 
SENIOR INDEPENDENT 
DIRECTOR
Vimala V.R. Menon, an Independent 
Non-Executive Director also serves 
as the Senior Independent Director. 
She acts as a liason between the 
shareholders and the company 
to convey their concerns and 
raise issues so that these can be 
channeled to the relevant parties. 
Her profile can be found at page 100 
of this Annual Report.
CHAIRMAN
The Chairman leads the Board and is 
responsible for promoting open and 
effective communication between the 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors, 
and for creating an environment at Board 
meetings in which all Directors contribute 
to discussions and feel comfortable 
in engaging in healthy debate and 
constructive challenge.
He is responsible for effective 
communication with shareholders and for 
ensuring the Board understands the views 
of all shareholders. The Chairman also 
ensures that the Group complies with good 
practice in corporate governance, ethical, 
environmental and human resources 
matters, and upholds high standards of 
integrity and probity.
BOARD ROLES
The roles of the Chairman and MD/CEO 
are separate and clearly defined, with 
the division of responsibilities set out in 
writing and agreed by the Board. The 
positions of Chairman and MD/CEO are 
held by two different individuals.
MD/CEO
The MD/CEO has day-to-day responsibility for the 
effective management of the Group’s business 
and for ensuring that Board decisions are 
implemented. He plays a key role in devising and 
reviewing Group strategies for discussion and 
approval by the Board. The MD/CEO is tasked 
with providing regular reports to the Board on 
all matters of significance relating to the Group’s 
business, or reputation, to ensure that the Board 
has accurate, timely and clear information on all 
matters on which a Board decision is required. 
He also promotes the culture and standard of 
the company. The Chairman and MD/CEO liaise 
closely and have frequent meetings, face-to face 
or by telephone, in which the Chairman is kept 
apprised of significant developments between 
Board meetings. 
The Board has two main Committees: the Audit Committee and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. The terms of reference for each Board 
Committee can be found at www.petronaschemicals.com.
The day-to-day operational management of the business is delegated by the Board to the MD/CEO, who is assisted by the Management Committee in 
managing the business.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
Chaired by Vimala V.R. Menon
Monitors the integrity of the Group’s financial statements/announcements, 
the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management as well as 
ensuring the quality and independence of the external auditors. For more 
information, see pages 127 to 131.
NOMINATION AND REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Chaired by Datuk William Toh Ah Wah
Reviews the structure, size and composition of the Board and its 
Committees, endorses suitable candidates for appointment to the Board, 
and reviews the succession planning. Additionally, endorses the Company’s 
directors’ remuneration policy and framework. For more information, see 
pages 122 and 126.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT
BOARD DIVERSITY
PCG has a diversity policy to ensure that the mix and profiles of our Board members, in terms of age, ethnicity and gender, provide the necessary 
range of perspectives, experience and expertise required to achieve effective stewardship and management. We believe that a truly diverse and 
inclusive Board will leverage differences in thought, perspective, knowledge, skill, regional and industry experience, cultural and geographical 
background, age, ethnicity and gender which will ensure that the Company retains its competitive advantage.
In this regard, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) is empowered to review and evaluate the composition and performance of the 
Board annually, as well as assessing qualified candidates to occupy Board positions. As for the composition of the Board, the NRC will determine the 
benefits of diversity in order to maintain an optimum mix of skills, knowledge and experience of the Board.
The NRC will continue to focus on diversity when assessing new candidates for Board memberships, as well as evaluating the performance of the 
Board and its individual members. In connection with its effort to create and maintain a diverse Board, the NRC will:
a) 
Adhere to the recruitment and sourcing process that seeks to include diverse candidates, including women in any director search.
b) 
Assess the appropriate mix of diversity including gender, ethnicity, age, skills, experience and expertise required on the Board and address gaps, 
if any.
c) 
Make recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointments and maintain an appropriate mix of diversity, skills, experience and 
expertise on the Board.
d) 
Periodically review and report to the Board on requirements in relation to diversity on the Board, if any.
The Board supports the country’s aspirational target of 30% representation of women directors. The NRC will review annually the composition of 
the Board in respect to gender, experience, skills, age and knowledge. At any given time, the Board may seek to improve one or more aspects of its 
diversity and measure progress accordingly. 
A copy of the Company’s diversity policy is available at www.petronaschemicals.com.
BOARD MEETINGS AND ATTENDANCE
The Board meetings together with Board Committee meetings for the financial year 2017, were pre-scheduled in November 2016 to facilitate the 
Directors in planning ahead and incorporating the meetings into their respective schedules. This also serves to provide the members with ample 
notice of the meetings.
A total of eight meetings were held during the year; to discuss and decide among others, quarterly financial results, performance reports and 
various other matters. In addition to the above meetings, the Company also conducted Board Strategic Conversation with the Management 
Committee of PCG on 20 November 2017. The purpose of the conversation is to provide the Board with updates on market outlook, external 
environment analysis and the Group’s strategic and growth plans. Besides the Board meetings, urgent decisions were approved via written circular 
resolutions.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved at Board meetings which includes corporate plans, annual budgets, operational and financial 
performance reviews, major investments and financial decisions, management performance assessment, changes to the Management and control 
structure within the Group, including key policies & procedures and limits of authority. The reports of the Board Audit and Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees are also presented and deliberated at board meetings. The minutes of each board meeting are circulated in a timely 
manner. All proceedings of board meetings are duly recorded in the minutes of each meeting and signed minutes of each board meeting are 
properly kept by the Company Secretary. Minutes of the board meeting are tabled for confirmation at the next board meeting.
All Directors complied with the minimum attendance requirement of at least 50% of Board meetings held during the financial year pursuant to the 
MMLR.

SUPPLY AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION
Prior to each board meeting, the agenda and a set of board papers encompassing qualitative and quantitative information relevant to the business 
of the meeting are circulated to all Directors five days prior to the meeting dates. This enables the Directors to have sufficient time to peruse the 
Board papers and seek clarification or further details from the Management or the Company Secretary before each meeting to ensure preparedness 
for the meeting. Any Director may request matters to be included in the agenda. Urgent papers may be presented and tabled at a meeting under 
the item “Any Other Business”, upon endorsement by the MD/CEO and approval by the Chairman. The content of the board papers prepared are 
comprehensive and include objectives, background, critical issues, implications, risks, strategic fit, recommendations and other pertinent information 
to enable informed decision making by the Board.
Presentations and briefings by the Management and relevant external advisors, where applicable, were also held at board meetings to advise the 
Board. In this regard, relevant information is furnished and clarification given to assist the Board in making a decision.
Access by the Board to board papers is carried out online through a secured collaborative software, which allows the Directors to access Board 
documents and collaborate with other Board Members and the Company Secretary electronically. The online accessibility facilitates the Directors to 
read and review documents or communicate with other Board members at any time.
The Directors have direct access to the Management and have unrestricted access to any information relating to the Group to enable them to 
discharge their duties. The Directors also have direct access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and are regularly updated on new 
statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the duties and responsibilities of the Directors. The Directors, whether as a full Board or in their 
individual capacity, may seek independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in furtherance of their duties.
THE BOARD’S RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES
The Board is charged with promoting the success of the Group by directing and supervising its affairs in a responsible and effective manner. 
Each Director has a duty to act in good faith and in the best interest of the Company. The Directors are aware of their collective and individual 
responsibilities to all shareholders for the manner in which the affairs of the Company are managed, controlled and operated.
The diagram illustrated in the next page shows the key areas of focus for the Board which appear as items on the Board’s agenda at relevant times 
throughout the year. Concentrated discussion of these items assists the Board in making the right decisions taking into account the long-term 
implications to the business and its stakeholders.

DIRECTOR’S DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME
On joining PCG, Directors receive a tailored briefing session by the MD/CEO and the relevant heads of department of the Company. This session helps 
new Directors to understand PCG’s business, market and financial performance of the Group. It also serves as a platform for new Directors to engage 
with the Senior Management of the Company and welcoming the new Directors to PCG.
All the Directors have attended the Mandatory Accreditation Programme as required under the MMLR of Bursa Malaysia. The Directors are regularly updated 
on the Group’s businesses and the competitive and regulatory environment in which the Group operates. 
The Directors recognise the importance and value of attending conferences, training programmes and seminars in order to keep themselves abreast with the 
development and changes in the industry in which the Group operates, as well as to update themselves on new statutory and regulatory requirements. During 
the year under review, the Directors have attended and participated in programmes, conferences and forums that covered the areas of corporate governance, 
financial, relevant industry updates and global business developments which they considered as useful in contributing to the effective discharge of their duties 
as Directors. The Directors also participated in familiarisation visits to the Group’s plants.
During the year, the Directors participated in seminars and training programmes in various capacities such as delegates and/or speakers as detailed below:

TERMS OF REFERENCE
The NRC is governed by its Terms of Reference (TOR), which are 
consistent with the requirements of the MMLR and MCCG 2017. The 
TOR of the NRC is accessible to the public for reference on PCG’s 
official website at www.petronaschemicals.com.
COMPOSITION
The NRC comprises exclusively Independent Non-Executive Director, in 
compliance with the requirement of the MMLR, which provides that 
the NRC must comprise exclusively non-executive directors, the majority 
of whom are independent directors. The composition also observed 
MCCG 2017 where the NRC is chaired by a Senior Independent Director 
or an Independent Director. In the case of PCG, the NRC is chaired by an 
Independent Director.
During the year, membership of NRC underwent a few changes, and 
announcements on the same were made to Bursa Malaysia accordingly. 
Datuk William Toh Ah Wah was appointed as an additional NRC 
member on 15 February 2017 and was later appointed as the NRC 
Chairman on 2 January 2018, in place of Ching Yew Chye, who remains 
as a member of the NRC. 
The NRC was established to enhance the efficiency and transparency of 
the Company’s governance process and to assist the Board in matters 
regarding among others the nomination and appointment of Directors 
and Key Management Personnel. In view of the same composition 
of members, PCG opts to combine its Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee for practical purposes.
In carrying out its duties and responsibilities, the NRC has the following 
authority:
• 
To seek any information it requires from employees, Company 
officers and external parties;
• 
To engage external consultants and other advisers or otherwise 
obtain independent legal or other professional services it requires, 
at the expense of the Company; and
• 
To request sufficient resources to undertake its duties including 
access to the Company Secretary.

MEETINGS
NRC convened two meetings during the 
financial year 2017. The attendance of the 
member is enumerated on page 118 in this 
Annual Report. MD/CEO, Company Secretary, 
Head of Human Resource Management 
Division and any other persons deemed 
necessary by the NRC are invited to attend 
and are present for deliberations which 
require their input or advice. The Company 
Secretary acts as Secretary to the NRC.
The NRC meetings for the financial year 2017 
were pre-scheduled in November 2016, to 
facilitate the members in planning ahead 
and incorporating the NRC meetings into 
their respective schedules. This also serves to 
provide the members with ample notice of 
the meetings.
The agenda and a set of meeting papers 
encompassing information relevant to the 
business of the meeting are distributed 
to the NRC Members, not less than five 
days from the meeting date via a secured 
collaborative software for deliberation
at the respective NRC meetings. The online 
accessibility facilitates the NRC members to 
read and review documents or communicate 
with other NRC members at any time.
All proceedings of the NRC meetings are 
duly recorded in the minutes of each 
meeting and signed minutes of each NRC 
meeting are properly kept by the Company 
Secretary. Minutes of the NRC meeting are 
tabled for confirmation at the next NRC 
meeting, after which they are circulated to 
the Board for notation. 
BOARD APPOINTMENT PROCESS
The Company maintains a formal and 
transparent procedure for the appointment 
of new directors. Nomination of directors 
to the Board is made either by Petroliam 
Nasional Berhad, being the majority 
shareholder, or through engagement of 
a professional recruitment firm to find 
suitable candidates to fill in the position of 
Independent Non-Executive Director. 
In its selection of suitable candidates, the 
NRC adheres to the guidelines stipulated in 
the Board Selection Criteria. The guidelines 
will assist the NRC in evaluating potential 
candidates for the purpose of appointment 
and re-appointment of Directors with proper 
selection criteria. 
 
DIRECTORS’ RE-ELECTION AND RE-APPOINTMENT
The NRC is responsible for recommending to the Board, directors who are standing for 
re-election at the AGM pursuant to Article 93 of PCG’s Constitution. 
Directors’ rotation list was presented to NRC for endorsement prior to recommendation to 
the Board and thereafter to the shareholders for approval. In assessing the candidates, the 
NRC takes into consideration on their attributes, competencies, commitment, personality 
and qualities as well as their contribution and performance based on the Board Effectiveness 
Evaluation (BEE). 
All potential candidates are first considered by the NRC, taking into account mix of skills, 
competencies, experience, integrity, personal attributes and time commitment required 
to effectively discharge his or her role as a director. Diversity in terms of age, gender and 
ethnicity are also considered during the selection process.

BOARD EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATION 2017 
The NRC has on 12 February 2018, reviewed the outcome of the 2017 BEE and noted that the 
Board is committed to the highest standards of good governance and continues to be seen as 
an excellent Board with outstanding support from the Management. At the same time, the 
NRC took note on the need to focus more on growth strategies plan implementation of the 
Group.
Pursuant to the MMLR of Bursa Malaysia, the NRC also reviewed the performance of the 
BAC and is satisfied that the Board Audit Committee (BAC) and its members discharged their 
functions, duties and responsibilities in accordance with its TOR. The Chairman of the NRC is 
actively involved throughout the BEE process and has the liberty to hold discussions with the 
Chairman of the Board.
For the year under review, the results were satisfactory and conform to industry benchmarks.
Article 93 of the Company’s Constitution 
provides that one-third of the Directors of 
the Company for the time being shall retire 
by rotation at an AGM at least once in three 
years but shall be eligible for re-election at 
the AGM.
The NRC at its meeting held on 7 December 
2017 endorsed for the following directors 
who are due for re-election at the 
forthcoming 20th AGM, be considered for 
re-election:
i) 
Datuk Md Arif Mahmood
ii) 
Vimala V.R. Menon
iii) 
Zakaria Kasah
The Board had at its meeting held on  
20 February 2018, approved the revision 
to the tenure policy where Independent 
Non-Executive Director tenure is capped at 
nine years without further extension. The 
Company opts to adopt exemplary practice 
as recommended by MCCG 2017.
There was no new appointment of Directors 
during the year under review. Hence, the 
retirement of newly appointed director and 
re-election thereon pursuant to Article 99 of 
the Company’s Constitution is not applicable.
BOARD EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATION 
Every year, under the purview of the NRC,  
a formal evaluation is undertaken to assess 
the effectiveness of the following:
a) 
The Board as a whole and the Board 
Committees.
b) Contribution of each individual Director.
c) 
Independence of Independent Directors.
The Company had engaged a third party 
consultant for the 2016 BEE, where the result 
was presented to the NRC in March 2017. 
For 2017 BEE, it was internally conducted 
and the process covers Board, Board 
Committee, Peer and Self Evaluations. The 
BEE focuses on maximising the effectiveness 
and performance of the Board and its 
Committees in the best interests of the 
Company.

COMMITTEE EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW  
AND PERFORMANCE
Based on the 2017 BEE findings, the Board 
believes that the current NRC’s composition 
provides the appropriate balance in terms of 
skills, knowledge and experience to promote 
the interests of all stakeholders and to meet 
the needs of the Group. The Board is satisfied 
with the performance and effectiveness 
of the NRC in providing sound advice and 
recommendations to the Board.
SUCCESSION PLANNING 
The Board Succession Plan will assist the 
Company in ensuring the orderly
identification and selection of new  
Non-Executive Directors in the event of 
an opening on the Board, whether such 
opening exists by reason of an anticipated 
retirement, an unanticipated departure, the 
expansion of the size of the Board,
or otherwise. 
During the year under review, the NRC 
deliberated the succession planning for 
Directors who are about to reach their nine 
year tenure.
REMUNERATION
Our approach to remuneration is based 
on reward principles which aims to 
provide remuneration packages that fairly 
reward the Executive Director and Senior 
Management for the contribution they 
make to the Group, having regard to the 
size and complexity of the Group’s business 
operations and the need to attract, retain 
and motivate executives of the highest 
quality.
The Board has established a formal and 
transparent Directors’ Remuneration 
Framework which comprise retainer fees, 
meeting allowances and benefits in-kind.
The Company has undertaken a review on 
the Directors remuneration to ascertain 
the competitiveness of the current 
Non-Executive Directors remuneration 
framework. A benchmarking exercise was 
carried out against selected companies in 
Malaysia. Based on the findings, the Board is 
recommending an increase in the Directors 
remuneration for the financial year ending 
31 December 2018 to reflect the increase in 
responsibilities of the Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors, for approval by the 
shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
DIRECTORS’ FEES
The approach to Directors’ fees is aligned with our strategic objectives, allows us to attract, 
motivate and retain high caliber talent, and as part of our risk framework, does not 
promote excessive risk-taking. The design of our fees architecture complies with regulatory 
requirements, embraces market practices and trends, and provides attractive and balanced 
rewards. The fees structure of Directors of the Company is as follows:
Retainer 
Fees/month
Meeting allowance per attendance

Annual Reporting
The BAC reviewed its report and the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 to 
ensure that they were prepared in compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements and guidelines.
INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION
The BAC is supported by an in-house internal audit function, the IAD, in discharging its governance responsibilities stated in the BAC’s TOR. 
The IAD undertakes a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of governance, risk management and 
control processes within the Group.
During the year under review, the internal audit function was headed by Zulaini Ahmad, who reports to the BAC. Effective 1 January 2018, 
Zulaini has been assigned to another role within the PETRONAS Group and the IAD is now headed by Mohd Effendi Mohd Nawi. Mohd Effendi 
is a qualified chartered accountant. He is a member of Chartered Accountant Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) and MIA. He also holds a 
Bachelor of Commerce from the University of New South Wales, Australia. Prior to joining PETRONAS in 1999, he was an auditor with Ernst & 
Young from 1994 until 1998, where his last position was as Audit Senior. He has held various positions within the PETRONAS Group and has 
vast experience mostly in finance. He was the Head, Finance and Accounts at PETRONAS Carigali Iraq Holding BV before assuming his current 
position as the PCG Head of IAD.
The BAC approves the internal audit plan and the key performance indicators of Head of IAD and reviews IAD’s annual budget and resource 
requirements. The Head of IAD communicates the results of internal audit engagements performed to the BAC as well as reports on IAD’s 
performance against the approved internal audit plan on a quarterly basis.
The IAD adopts the Institute of Internal Auditors’ International Professional Practices Framework and the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organisation of the Treadway Commission’s internal control framework, in its processes and activities. In performing the audit engagements, 
the internal auditors adhere to the IAD’s established procedures and guidelines, as well as relevant policies and procedures adopted by 
the Group. In maintaining independence and objectivity, internal auditors will not be assigned audit scope that would lead to a conflict of 
interest.
The IAD continues to adopt a risk-based approach to ensure that the audit plans are prioritised based on the Group’s key risks. In deriving the 
audit plan, the IAD gathers input from various sources including the risk profile of the Group, business plans and strategies, past audit issues 
and feedbacks from external auditors, BAC and the Management.

Senior Management together with the Company’s Investor Relations 
Unit, conducted regular dialogues with both its local and foreign

proxies to attend and vote on their behalf. Each item of special 
business included in the notice of the AGM will be accompanied by an 
explanatory statement on the effects of the proposed resolution.
At each AGM, shareholders are encouraged and given sufficient 
opportunity as well as time by the Board to raise questions pertaining 
to the Annual Report, resolutions being proposed and the business 
of the Company or the Group in general prior to seeking approval 
from members and proxies on the resolutions. The Board, Senior

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
PCG HAS A RISK MANAGEMENT 
FRAMEWORK AND INTERNAL 
CONTROL SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO 
ENSURE THE SMOOTH RUNNING 
OF OUR BUSINESS. 
We aim to manage our risks 
and control our business and 
financial affairs economically, 
efficiently and effectively to be 
able to seize profitable business 
opportunities in a disciplined way, 
while avoiding or mitigating risks 
that could cause loss, reputational 
damage or business failure.
This statement on risk 
management and internal 
control is made in accordance 
with paragraph 15.26(B) of Bursa 
Malaysia’s Main Market Listing 
Requirements (MMLR) which 
requires the board of directors 
of public companies to publish a 
statement about the state of risk 
management and internal control 
of the listed issuer as a Group.
We believe our control systems are appropriate for the Group given the size, diversity and 
complexity of our operations. Our Board Audit Committee regularly reviews and monitors 
the adequacy and integrity of these controls to ensure the Group’s compliance with 
applicable laws, regulations and guidelines.
Our Directors recognise that such systems can only provide a reasonable and not absolute 
assurance that significant risks which impact the Group’s strategies and objectives are within 
levels appropriate to the Group’s business as approved by the Board. Key elements of the risk 
management and systems of internal control are set out below.
BOARD ACCOUNTABILITY
The Board acknowledges the importance of maintaining a sound internal control system 
and a robust risk management practice for good corporate governance with the objective 
of safeguarding the shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets. It further affirms 
its overall responsibility for reviewing the adequacy and integrity of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems.
The Group has established a process for identifying, evaluating, treating, monitoring 
and managing critical risks that may materially affect the achievement of our corporate 
objectives. The Board monitors the critical risks regularly.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The business environment including market, geopolitical and regulatory in which we operate 
are volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Our challenge is to identify all potential 
risks and either minimise, accept, transfer or avoid them. This demands a proactive Risk 
Management Framework, which is implemented through PCG Group wide.
We continue to strengthen our risk management approach to safeguard our business and 
ensure the ability to respond to a crisis. Our focus is on three key areas, namely Enterprise 
Risk Management, Crisis Management and Business Continuity Management.
While the Board oversees our overall risk management as part of robust corporate 
governance, we recognise that risk management is the responsibility of everyone in PCG. 
Rather than being a separate and standalone process, risk management is integrated into our 
business planning, capital allocation, investment decisions, internal control and day-to-day 
operations to enhance ownership and agility in managing risk effectively.

RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Our structured risk profiling process, which is in line with the approved PCG Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) and Enterprise 
Risk Management Process Guideline (ERMPG), is set out as below.
Our Corporate Risk Profile (CRP) is based on the ERM concept, and is reviewed regularly. The identification of risks takes into account PCG’s 
strategic objectives. Inputs are assessed and analysed based on both internal factors and external factors that may impact our business and 
operations prior to the risk profiling activities.
The identified risks are analysed, evaluated and mapped onto a matrix which specifies their likelihood of its happening and its impact to PCG. 
Subsequently, risk mitigation plans are determined depending on risk mitigation strategies to reduce the risks to acceptable levels. Key Risk 
Indicators (KRIs) are identified to facilitate the monitoring of risks and provide early warning signals on potential risk escalation.  
The status of key risk indicators and mitigation of critical risks are deliberated at the Risk Management Committee and presented to the Board 
Audit Committee as well as the Board of Directors during quarterly meetings. Each critical risk has a dedicated owner responsible for the 
implementation of control measures, monitoring and tracking of key risk indicators, as well as identifying and implementing additional risk 
mitigation measures. The risks and mitigation measures are communicated to the line on a timely basis to ensure awareness at all levels.

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
To further strengthen our risk management, 
we apply the following PETRONAS structured 
risk management assessment approach and 
tools:
• 
PETRONAS Health Safety 
Environment Management System 
(HSEMS) – to manage HSE risks and 
ensure our operations are in tandem 
with HSE regulatory requirements and 
industry best practices. 
• 
Counterparty Risk Assessment –  
to ensure the systematic identification, 
assessment and mitigation of risks 
associated with credit and performance, 
in line with PETRONAS Corporate 
Financial Policy and PETRONAS Credit 
Guidelines. Each counterparty is 
assigned credit ratings which eventually 
facilitate the business decision-making. 
• 
Project Risk Assessment (PRA) –  
to ensure the systematic identification, 
assessment and mitigation of risks 
associated with projects, in line with 
PETRONAS Project Management System 
(PPMS) requirements.
• 
Contractor Risk Assessment (CoRA) 
– to ensure the systematic identification, 
assessment and mitigation of risks 
critical to contractors’ performance. 
CoRA is undertaken as part of the 
procurement process prior to contractor 
selection.
• 
Turnaround Risk Assessment (TaRA) 
– to ensure the systematic identification, 
assessment and mitigation of risks for 
turnaround activities.

CRISIS MANAGEMENT
PCG is exposed to potential crisis events of varying severity due to the nature of its 
business operations. To respond to any crisis that may manifest, PCG has established a Crisis 
Management Plan (CMP) that prescribes the organisation of the Crisis Management Team 
(CMT), comprising key management personnel in order to provide strategic support to control 
and mitigate the crisis. 
The CMP has also outlined a three-tiered response system based on severity of the crisis that 
provides clear demarcation of response control and required capability of emergency or crisis 
team members in order to protect and save people, environment, asset and reputation.
 
BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT
In the event of prolonged business disruption, we have a BCM Framework and Guidelines 
that provides a systematic approach to ensure continuous delivery of products or services to 
customers. 
For more information on Financial Risk, kindly 
refer to Notes to the Financial Statements on 
page 205-211.

OUR STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE
HOW WE ARE GOVERNED
STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
PCG has established a BCM organisational 
structure to provide guidance and 
direction in the implementation and 
institutionalisation of BCM practices. Risk 
assessment is undertaken to identify, analyse 
and evaluate risks that could cause business 
disruptions justifying the need for recovery 
plans. Subsequently, a Business Impact 
Analysis (BIA) is conducted to identify critical 
business functions and products. It further 
assesses the impact of unavailability over 
time, setting minimum timeframes and 
resources to recover or resume operations. 
The BIA determines our Business Recovery 
Strategy (BRS) to resume or recover business 
activities.
The BCP and BRP describe the organisation 
structure, roles and responsibilities of 
each party, required resources and specific 
recovery strategies. PCG has established 
BCP for Products Supply to address abrupt 
and prolonged outage of the products 
supply, that could affect products delivery 
to customers. Additionally the Group has 
developed BCP for PETRONAS Twin Towers 
to cater for inaccessibility of workplace, 
failure of critical ICT systems and prolonged 
unavailability of key personnel.
BRPs for PCG plants and facilities are 
also tested and the reports presented to 
management for tracking and monitoring. 
Findings and feedback gathered post-testing 
are analysed for continual improvement. 
The reports are also presented to the various 
oversight risk management committees.
Tests and drills are regularly conducted 
to ensure readiness of PCG and our 
management team in managing crisis and 
business continuity, as well as the robustness 
of our plans.
COMPLIANCE UNDER OUR RISK 
MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
The inculcation of a compliance culture is 
key aspect of an effective risk management. 
In supporting a risk compliance culture, 
PCG acknowledges the importance of risk 
assurance programmes to provide assurance 
to stakeholders that the systems of risk 
management and internal controls are 
implemented and complied with. For the 
year under review, PCG established its risk 
assurance programmes based on an annual 
risk assurance plan that was endorsed by our 
RMC.
PCG conducted two Tier 1 self-assessments per year whereby all subsidiaries are required to 
perform self-assessment and validation on their compliance to the requirement stipulated 
under ERM Framework and proposes gap closure actions, if any. PCG Risk Management 
Department also performed Tier 2 risk assurance to validate the ERM systems and 
effectiveness of agreed risk mitigations at PCG subsidiaries. The RMC reviewed the risk 
assurance reports and monitors the appropriate corrective actions for timely closure. In 
addition, the status of our risk assurance progress and gap closures are reported to the Risk 
Management Committee on quarterly basis.
INTERNAL CONTROL
 
Management is primarily responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of 
internal controls, while the Board and the Board Audit Committee oversee the actions of 
management and monitor the effectiveness of the controls that have put in place. The Group 
refers to the 17 principles of the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO), as a guide for effective internal control as illustrated below: 
» 
Specifies objectives with sufficient clarity for risk identification and assessment
» 
Identifies and analyses risks relating to objectives for determining how the risks 
to be managed
» 
Evaluates and considers potential for fraud in assessing risks
» 
Identifies and assesses changes that could significantly impact the internal 
controls system

ANNUAL REPORT 2017


STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
Joint venture and associate companies are 
not included in our Group internal controls 
as these companies fall under the purview 
of their respective majority shareholders. 
The interests of the Group are safeguarded 
through Group representatives to the 
respective Boards of joint venture and 
associate companies, in addition to the 
regular review of management accounts and 
joint shareholders’ audit. 
INTERNAL AUDIT
Internal audits are undertaken to provide 
independent assessments on the adequacy, 
efficiency and effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal controls. The Group has its own 
dedicated internal audit function that 
provides a systematic and disciplined 
approach to evaluate and improve the 
effectiveness of control and governance 
processes within the Group. It maintains its 
impartiality, proficiency and due professional 
care and reports directly to the BAC.
The internal audit function reviews the 
internal controls of selected key activities of 
the Group’s businesses based upon an annual 
internal audit plan which is presented to 
the BAC for approval. The annual audit 
plan is established primarily on a risk based 
approach. The BAC reviews audit reports and 
the necessary corrective actions as advised 
by the Management. The Management 
is responsible for ensuring that corrective 
actions are implemented accordingly. In 
addition, the status of the closures of audit 
issues are reported to the BAC on a quarterly 
basis.
The internal audit processes and activities 
are guided by the approved Internal Audit 
Charter and aligned with internal audit 
industry standards (i.e. The International 
Professional Practices Framework (IPPF) 
issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors 
(IIA) and Committee of Sponsoring 
organisations of the Treadway Commission 
(COSO) internal control framework).

OTHER KEY ELEMENTS OF INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS
In furtherance to the Board’s commitment to maintain a sound system of internal control, the 
Board continues to maintain and implement a strong control structure and environment for 
the proper conduct of the Group’s business operations as follows:
»  Board of Directors
 
The Board meets at least quarterly and has set a schedule of matters, which is required 
to be brought to its attention for discussion, thus ensuring that it maintains full and 
effective supervision over appropriate controls. The MD/CEO leads the Management in 
presentation of board papers and ensures Management provides detailed explanation 
of pertinent issues. In arriving at any decision requiring Board’s approval, as set out in 
the Limits of Authority manual, thorough deliberation and discussion by the Board is 
a prerequisite. In addition, the Board is kept updated on the Group’s activities and its 
operations on a regular basis. 
»  Board Audit Committee
 
The Board has delegated the duty of reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal controls to the BAC. 
 
The BAC assumes the overall duties of reviewing with the external auditors their audit 
plan, audit report, as well as their findings and recommendations pursuant to the year 
end audit. The BAC also evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems through reviews of internal control issues 
identified by internal auditors and Management. Throughout the year, the BAC was 
updated on developments in MMLR of Bursa Malaysia, MFRS as well as new legal and 
regulatory requirements. 
 
The BAC meets at least quarterly and has full and unimpeded access to the internal and 
external auditors as well as all employees of the Group. 
 
Further information relating to the activities of the BAC is set out in the BAC’s report as 
presented on pages 127 to 131 of this Annual Report.
»  Organisation Structure and Management Committee
 
An organisational structure, which is aligned to the business and operational 
requirements, and with clearly defined lines of responsibility, accountability and levels 
of authority, is in place to assist in implementing the Group’s strategies and day-to-day 
business activities. 
 
The Company has a Management 
Committee which serves in an advisory 
capacity to the Managing Director/CEO 
in accomplishing the vision, strategies 
and objectives set for the Group.
 
Various functional committees have 
also been established across the Group 
to ensure the Group’s activities and 
operations are properly aligned towards 
achieving the organisational goals and 
objectives.
»  
Financial Control Framework
 
The Group has implemented a Financial 
Control Framework to ensure key internal 
control systems are adequate and effective 
at all times. The framework mandates strict 
processes to improve financial reporting 
and disclosure so as to protect stakeholders 
from the possibility of inaccurate 
accounting. Key components of the 
Financial Control Framework requirements 
are:
Certification on the 
accuracy of the reported 
financial statement by 
senior management.
Establishment of adequate 
internal controls and 
reporting methods as well 
as proper documentation of 
all processes.
Mandatory self and 
interdepartmental test of 
controls.
Identification of the control 
gaps and the required 
mitigation action.

the proper measures to be undertaken 
in a given set of circumstances. The 
procedures and guidelines are also 
reviewed on a regular basis to ensure 
continuing relevance and effectiveness.
»  Business Plan and Budget
 
The Group undertakes an annual 
budgeting and forecasting exercise 
which includes development of business 
strategies for the next five years and 
the establishment of KPIs against which 
the overall performance of the Group, 
including the respective performance 
of business segments and companies 
within the Group, can be measured 
and evaluated. Detailed operating and 
capital expenditure requirements are 
tabled to the Board for approval prior to 
the commencement of a new financial 
year. The Group’s performances are 
reported internally on a monthly basis 
to the Management Committee. The 
Group’s quarterly performances are also 
presented to the Board with comparison 
to approved plans as well as against 
prior periods. The Group’s strategic 
direction is also reviewed through a 
rigorous assessment process taking into 
account changes in market conditions 
and significant business risks.
»  Information and Communications 
Technology
 
Information and communications 
technology is extensively deployed in 
the Group to automate work processes, 
where possible and to efficiently collect 
key business information. The Group 
continues to enhance its information 
and communication systems in ensuring 
that it can act as an enabler to improve 
business processes including adherence 
to the Group’s business objectives, 
policies and procedures whilst enhancing

agreed KPIs on a periodic basis.
» 
 Whistleblowing Policy
 
The Group has adopted the PETRONAS 
Whistleblowing Policy which provides 
an avenue for the Group employees and 
members of the public to disclose any 
improper conduct in accordance with 
the procedures as provided under the 
policy.
 
Under the Whistleblowing Policy, a 
whistleblower will be accorded with 
protection of confidentiality of identity, 
to the extent reasonably practicable. 
An employee who whistleblows 
internally will also be protected against 
any adverse and detrimental actions 
for disclosing any improper conduct 
committed or about to be committed 
within the Group, to the extent 
reasonably practicable, provided that 
the disclosure is made in good faith. 
Such protection is accorded even if 
the investigation later reveals that the 
whistleblower is mistaken as to the 
facts, rules and procedures involved. The 
process is undertaken by PETRONAS’ 
Whistleblowing Committee. The policy 
and procedures are accessible to the 
public for reference on the Company’s 
website at www.petronaschemicals.com.

The Group has established policies and 
procedures with regards to RPT (including 
RRPT), and COI to ensure full compliance to the 
MMLR of Bursa Malaysia. 
The policies and standard operating procedures 
require the use of various methods to ensure

The Board Audit Committee is responsible 
to ensure that the policies and procedures 
relating to RPTs/RRPTs and COI situations 
are sufficient to ensure that RPTs/RRPTs are 
carried out on normal commercial terms 
and not to the detriment of the Group’s 
minority shareholders.
5
On an annual basis, all Directors and 
any related party of the Group will 
declare in writing an annual declaration 
form, designed to elicit information 
about potential relationships and/or COI 
situations, involving their interest, either 
directly or indirectly. All Directors and any 
related party of the Group shall also notify 
in writing of any interest in RPT/RRPT or COI 
situation when it becomes known to them.
6
The Group’s Legal and Corporate 
Secretariat performs reviews on all 
commercial contracts. System based records 
are maintained to capture the RPTs/RRPTs 
which have been entered into. Processes 
concerning negotiations, tendering and 
analysis carried out for transactions 
between related parties are appropriately 
documented and retained to support and 
evidence that such transactions have been 
carried out on normal commercial terms 
and are not detrimental to the Group’s 
minority shareholders. 
7
The Company has been granted a waiver from 
complying with the requirement of Paragraph 
10.09 of the MMLR of Bursa Malaysia including 
having to seek shareholders’ approval in 
relation to the supply, sale, purchase, provision 
and usage of certain goods, services and 
facilities which form part of PETRONAS Group 
integrated operations. 
PCG forms part of the integrated oil and 
gas value chain of the PETRONAS Group. 
The transactions such as the supply of raw 
materials are vital to PCG’s operations, and 
alternative supplies will not be readily available 
as PETRONAS Group is a major supplier and at 
times, the sole supplier of such raw materials. 
Due to the integrated nature of PCG’s business 
operations with the PETRONAS Group, the 
waiver is of particular significance to ensure 
PCG does not experience any disruption to its 
operations.
The details of the RRPTs incurred during the 
year that were waived by Bursa Malaysia are 
presented on page 144 of this Annual Report.
MANAGEMENT’S ACCOUNTABILITY
Management is accountable to the Board for the 
implementation of the processes in identifying, 
evaluating, monitoring and reporting of risks 
and internal control as prescribed above. The 
MD/CEO and CFO have provided the Board with 
assurance that the Group risk management and 
internal control system is operating adequately 
and effectively, in all material aspects, to 
ensure achievement of corporate objectives. In 
providing the above assurance by MD/CEO and 
CFO, similar assurances have also been obtained 
from Management Committee members 
confirming the adequacy and effectiveness of 
risk management practice and internal control 
system within their respective areas.
CONCLUSION
Based on the above, the Board is of the view 
that the system of internal control instituted 
throughout PCG is sound and provides a level 
of confidence on which the Board relies for 
assurance. In the year under review, there was 
no significant control failure or weakness that 
would result in material losses, contingencies 
or uncertainties requiring separate disclosure in 
this Annual Report.
The Board and Management will continue 
to review and strengthen the Group’s risk 
management and internal control system to 
ensure ongoing adequacy and effectiveness 
of the system of internal control and risk 
management practices to meet the changing 
and challenging operating environment.

The purpose of financial statements is to communicate the Group’s financial information to its stakeholders, especially shareholders, investors 
and lenders. In this section we try to help readers who are not familiar with accounting rules and financial expressions to understand our 
financial information, by explaining the functions and relationships between the essential financial statements: the statement of profit or loss 
and other comprehensive income, the statement of financial position and the statement of cash flows. For comprehensive and authoritative 
definitions and explanations, readers should turn to the relevant accounting standards, but we hope this section offers useful guidance.
This statement comprises (a) profit or 
loss and (b) other comprehensive income 
(OCI). The objective of this statement 
is to present all income or expenses 
(transactions with non-owners) in a 
performance statement. OCI represents 
certain income and expenses which 
are not recognised in profit or loss as 
required or permitted by the relevant 
accounting standard.Transactions with

obligations (debts and other liabilities) 
and owners’ equity at a particular point 
of time, in this case, our year end at 
31 December 2017. It also shows how 
the economic resources contributed by 
lenders and shareholders are used in the 
business. In the past, we used to call this 
statement a “balance sheet” because 
at any given time, assets must equal 
liabilities plus owners’ equity (in other 
words, be in balance). The current name 
reflects its function more accurately.
This statement divides the cash flows 
into operating, investing and financing 
cash flows. While the operating profit 
underlies the operating cash flows, 
certain non-cash charges or credits, 
such as depreciation and amortisation, 
are adjusted for, thus the operating 
cash flows and the operating profit are 
different. Investing cash flows are the 
cash flows arising from the purchase or 
disposal of non-current assets. Financing 
cash flows represent the cash flows 
between its shareholders and lenders.
“A snapshot, taken at a point 
in time, of all the assets the 
company owns and all the claims 
against those assets”
“Where the company gets its 
cash and how it spends it”
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ILLUSTRATED
The diagram in the next page illustrates the relationships between the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the statement 
of financial position and the statement of cash flows, as well as their links with the Group’s stakeholders.
On one hand, the Group earns revenue from customers through the deployment of assets. On the other hand, it pays operating expenses mainly 
relating to supply of goods and services, staff costs as well as invests in additional non-current assets. The net balance of revenue and operating 
expenses is the operating profit. After deducting payment to lenders, this profit is available for payment to tax authorities and for distribution 
to shareholders in return for their contribution of funds to the Group.

measured by recording the  
flow of resources over  
a period of time”

DIRECTORS’ BENEFITS
Since the end of the previous financial year, no Director of the Company has received or become entitled to receive any benefit (other than the 
benefits included in the aggregate amount of remuneration received or due and receivable by the Directors as shown in the financial statements 
or the fixed salary of a full time employee of the Company or of the related corporations) by reason of a contract made by the Company or a 
related corporation with the Director or with a firm of which the Director is a member, or with a company in which the Director has a substantial 
financial interest.
 
There were no arrangements during and at the end of the financial year which had the object of enabling Directors of the Company to acquire 
benefits by means of the acquisition of shares in or debentures of the Company or any other body corporate.
ISSUE OF SHARES 
There were no changes in the issued and paid up capital of the Company during the financial year. 
OPTIONS GRANTED OVER UNISSUED SHARES 
No options were granted to any person to take up unissued shares of the Company during the financial year.
INDEMNITY AND INSURANCE COSTS
During the financial year, PETRONAS and its subsidiaries, including the Company, maintained a Directors and Officers Liability Insurance as 
permitted by Section 289 of the Companies Act, 2016. The total insured limit for the Directors and Officers Liability Insurance effected for the 
Directors and Officers of PETRONAS Group was RM300 million per occurrence and in the aggregate. The insurance premium for the Company 
is RM7,114.
OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION
Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were made out, the Directors took reasonable steps to ascertain that:
(i) 
all known bad debts have been written off and adequate provision made for doubtful debts, and
(ii) 
any current assets which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business have been written down to an amount which they 
might be expected so to realise.
At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:
(i) 
that would render the amount written off for bad debts, or the amount of the provision for doubtful debts in the Group or in the Company 
inadequate to any substantial extent, or
(ii) 
that would render the value attributed to the current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company misleading, or
(iii) 
which have arisen which render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of the Company 
misleading or inappropriate, or
(iv) 
not otherwise dealt with in this report or the financial statements that would render any amount stated in the financial statements of the 
Group and of the Company misleading.

OUR NUMBERS
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. 
BASIS OF PREPARATION
1.1  Statement of compliance
 
The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting 
Standards (MFRS), International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act, 2016 in Malaysia. 
 
These financial statements also comply with the applicable disclosure provisions of the Listing Requirements of the Bursa Malaysia 
Securities Berhad. 
 
As of 1 January 2017, the Group and the Company have adopted amendments to MFRS and IC Interpretations (collectively referred 
to as “pronouncements”) that have been issued by Malaysian Accounting Standards Board (MASB) as described fully in Note 33.
 
The adoption of these pronouncements does not have any material impact to the financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company.
 
MASB has also issued new and revised pronouncements which are not yet effective for the Group and the Company and therefore, 
have not been adopted for in these financial statements. These pronouncements including their impact on the financial statements 
in the period of initial applications are set out in Note 34. New and revised pronouncements that are not relevant to the operations 
of the Group and of the Company are set out in Note 35.  
 
These financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 20 February 2018.
1.2 
Basis of measurement
 
The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared on historical cost basis except for certain items which 
are measured at fair value as disclosed in accounting policies below.
1.3 
Functional and presentation currency
 
The individual financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The Group’s and the Company’s financial statements are presented in 
Ringgit Malaysia (RM), which is the Company’s functional currency. All financial information have been rounded to the nearest 
million, unless otherwise stated.
1.4 
Use of estimates and judgments 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with MFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 
 
 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
financial year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.
 
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies 
that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are described in the following notes:
(i) 
Note 9 : Deferred tax; and
(ii) 
Note 17 : Other long term liabilities and provisions.

2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements and have been 
applied consistently by the Group and the Company, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 
Basis of consolidation
(i) 
Subsidiaries
 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
Potential voting rights are considered when assessing control only when such rights are substantive. The Group considers it has 
de facto power over an investee when, despite not having the majority of voting rights, it has the current ability to direct the 
activities of the investee that significantly affect the investee’s return.
 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group from the date that 
control commences until the date that control ceases.
 
Subsidiaries that were acquired from PETRONAS upon Initial Public Offering (IPO) are consolidated using the merger method 
of accounting. Other subsidiaries are consolidated using the acquisition method of accounting. 
 
Under the merger method of accounting, the results of entities or businesses under common control are accounted for as if the 
acquisition had occurred at the date that common control was established. The assets and liabilities acquired are recognised at 
the carrying amounts in the consolidated statements of financial position. The difference between the cost of acquisition and 
the nominal value of the shares acquired together with the share premium are taken to merger reserve (or adjusted against 
any suitable reserve in the case of debit differences). The other components of equity of the acquired entities are added to the 
same components within the Group.
 
All intercompany transactions are eliminated on consolidation and revenue and profits relate to external transactions only. 
Unrealised losses resulting from intercompany transactions are also eliminated unless cost cannot be recovered. 
 
Business combinations
 
A business combination is a transaction or other event in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. Business 
combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are 
measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. The cost of the acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair value 
of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. Non-controlling interests are 
stated either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition date.
 
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group remeasures its previously held non-controlling equity interest in 
the acquiree at fair value at the acquisition date, with any resulting gain or loss recognised in the profit or loss. Increase in the 
Group’s ownership interest in an existing subsidiary is accounted for as equity transactions with differences between the fair 
value of consideration paid and the Group’s proportionate share of net assets acquired recognised directly in equity.
 
The Group measures goodwill as the excess of the cost of an acquisition and the fair values of any previously held interest in the 
acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. When the excess 
is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
 
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issuance of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection 
with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.1 
Basis of consolidation (continued)
(i)   Subsidiaries (continued)
 
Non-controlling interests
 
Non-controlling interests at the end of reporting period, being the portion of the net assets of subsidiaries attributable to 
equity interests that are not owned by the Company, whether directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, are presented in 
the consolidated statements of financial position and statements of changes in equity within equity, separately from equity 
attributable to the shareholders of the Company. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented in the 
consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as an allocation of the profit or loss and total 
comprehensive income for the financial year between the non-controlling interests and shareholders of the Company.
 
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so 
causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance. 
 
The Group treats all changes in its ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control as equity transactions 
between the Group and its non-controlling interest holders. Any difference between the Group’s share of net assets before and 
after the change, and any consideration received or paid is adjusted to or against Group reserves.
 
Loss of control
 
Upon loss of control of a subsidiary, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the former subsidiary, any non-
controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the former subsidiary from the consolidated statements 
of financial position. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognised in profit or loss. If the Group retains any 
interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently, it 
is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee or as an available-for-sale financial asset depending on the level of influence 
retained.
(ii) 
Joint arrangements
 
Joint arrangements are arrangements in which the Group has joint control, established by contracts requiring unanimous 
consent for decisions about the activities that significantly affect the arrangements’ returns.
 
Joint arrangements are classified as either joint operation or joint venture. A joint arrangement is classified as joint operation 
when the Group or the Company has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to an arrangement. The 
Group and the Company account for each of its share of the assets, liabilities and transactions, including its share of those held 
or incurred jointly with the other investors, in relation to the joint operation. A joint arrangement is classified as joint venture 
when the Group or the Company has rights only to the net assets of the arrangement. The Group accounts for its interest in the 
joint venture using the equity method as described in Note 2.1(iii).
(iii) Associates
 
Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence including representation on the Board of Directors, but not 
control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies of the investee company.
 
Associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. The consolidated financial 
statements include the Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the equity-accounted 
associates, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence 
commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
 
The Group’s share of post-acquisition reserves and retained profits less losses is added to the carrying value of the investment 
in the consolidated statements of financial position. These amounts are taken from the latest audited financial statements or 
management financial statements of the associates.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.1 
Basis of consolidation (continued)
(iii) Associates (continued)
 
When the Group’s share of post-acquisition losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted associate, the carrying amount of 
that interest (including any long term investments) is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except 
to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the associate.
 
When the Group ceases to have significant influence over an associate, it is accounted for as a disposal of the entire interest in 
that associate, with the resulting gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss. Any retained interest in the former associate at 
the date when significant influence is lost is measured at fair value and this amount is regarded as the initial carrying amount 
of a financial asset.
 
When the Group’s interest in an associate decreases but does not result in loss of significant influence, any retained interest 
is not re-measured. Any gain or loss arising from the decrease in interest is recognised in profit or loss. Any gains or losses 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income are also reclassified proportionately to the profit or loss if that gain or 
loss would be required to be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets and liabilities.
 
Unrealised profits arising from transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 
interests in the associates. Unrealised losses on such transactions are also eliminated partially, unless cost cannot be recovered.
2.2 
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
 
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Projects-in-progress is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any, and is not depreciated.
 
Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes 
the costs of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to working condition for their 
intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the assets and restoring the site on which they are located. For qualifying 
assets, borrowing costs are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy on financing costs. Purchased software that is integral 
to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.
 
When significant components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as 
separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
 
The cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item 
if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Group or the Company and its 
cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised with 
any corresponding gain or loss recognised in profit or loss accordingly. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and 
equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
 
Depreciation for property, plant and equipment other than projects-in-progress, is recognised in the profit or loss on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of an item of property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment 
are not depreciated until the assets are ready for their intended use. 
 
Buildings are depreciated over their useful lives or over the remaining land lease period, whichever is shorter. 
 
Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group 
will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.

2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.2 
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation (continued)
 
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment for the current and comparative years are as follows:
Leasehold land 
20 - 99 years
Buildings 
14 - 66 years
Plant and equipment 
3 - 67 years
Office equipment, furniture and fittings 
5 - 7 years
Computer software and hardware 
5 years
Motor vehicles 
 3 - 5 years
 
The depreciable amount is determined after deducting residual value. The residual value, useful life and depreciation method are 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the amount, period and method of depreciation are consistent with 
previous estimates and the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the items of property, 
plant and equipment.
 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its 
use or disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the net carrying amount is recognised in the profit or 
loss.
2.3 
Leased assets
 
A lease arrangement is accounted for as finance or operating lease in accordance with the accounting policy as stated below. When 
the fulfilment of an arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset, it 
is accounted for as a lease in accordance with the accounting policy below although the arrangement does not take the legal form 
of a lease. 
(i) 
Finance lease
 
A lease is recognised as a finance lease if it transfers substantially to the Group or the Company all the risks and rewards 
incidental to ownership. Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair 
value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in 
accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. The corresponding liability is included in the statements of 
financial position as long term liabilities and other payables.
 
Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance costs and the reduction of the 
outstanding liability. Finance costs, which represent the difference between the total leasing commitments and the fair value 
of the assets acquired, are recognised in the profit or loss and allocated over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each accounting period. 
 
Contingent lease payments, if any, are accounted for by revising the minimum lease payments over the remaining term of the 
lease when the lease adjustment is confirmed.
 
Leasehold land which in substance is a finance lease is classified as property, plant and equipment.
(ii) 
Operating lease
 
All leases that do not transfer substantially to the Group and the Company all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership 
are classified as operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognised on the Group’s and the Company’s statements of 
financial position.
 
Payments made under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term 
of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line 
basis. 
 
Leasehold land which in substance is an operating lease is classified as prepaid lease payments.

Leased assets (continued)
(iii) Prepaid lease payments 
 
Prepaid rental and leasehold land which in substance is an operating lease are classified as prepaid lease payments. The payments 
made on entering into a lease arrangement or acquiring a leasehold land are accounted for as prepaid lease payments that are 
amortised over the lease term in accordance with the pattern of benefits provided. 
2.4 
Investments
 
Long term investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any, in the Company’s 
financial statements, unless the investments are classified as held for sale or distribution. The cost of investments includes transaction 
costs.
The carrying amount of these investments includes fair value adjustments on shareholder’s loans and advances, if any (Note 2.6(i)).
2.5 
Intangible asset
Intangible asset, which comprises a license obtained from a third party, is measured on initial recognition at cost. 
 
Following initial recognition, intangible asset is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment 
losses.
 
Amortisation for intangible asset is recognised in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful life. 
The amortisation method and the useful life for intangible asset are reviewed at each reporting date. Intangible asset is assessed for 
impairment whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired.  
 
The estimated useful life for the current and comparative years is 10 years.
 
Subsequent expenditure on intangible asset is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the 
specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditures are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
2.6 
Financial instruments 
 
A financial instrument is recognised in the statements of financial position when, and only when, the Group or the Company becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
(i) 
Financial assets 
 
Initial recognition
 
Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, or loans and receivables, as appropriate. The 
Group and the Company determine the classification of financial assets at initial recognition. 
 
Financial assets are recognised initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not 
at fair value through profit or loss, any transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial 
instrument.
 
Purchases or sales under a contract which terms require delivery of financial assets within a timeframe established by regulation 
or convention in the marketplace concerned (“regular way purchases”) are recognised on the trade date i.e. the date that the 
Group or the Company commits to purchase or sell the financial asset. 
 
Fair value adjustments on shareholder’s loans and advances at initial recognition, if any, are added to the carrying value of 
investments in the Company’s financial statements.
 
The Group’s and the Company’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, fund investments, trade and other receivables, 
loans and advances, and derivative financial instruments.

Financial assets (continued)
 
Subsequent measurement
 
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as follows:
 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
 
Fair value through profit or loss category comprises financial assets that are held for trading, including derivatives (except for 
a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument) and financial assets that 
are specifically designated into this category upon initial recognition. 
 
Financial assets categorised as fair value through profit or loss are subsequently measured at their fair value with gains or losses 
recognised in the profit or loss. The methods used to measure fair value are stated in Note 2.7.
 
Loans and receivables 
 
Loans and receivables category comprises debt instruments that are not quoted in an active market. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, financial assets categorised as loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method (Note 2.6 (vi)).
(ii) 
Financial liabilities 
 
Initial recognition
 
Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, or financial liabilities measured 
at amortised cost, as appropriate. The Group and the Company determine the classification of financial liabilities at initial 
recognition.
 
Financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value less, in the case of loans and borrowings, any directly attributable 
transaction costs.
 
The Group’s and the Company’s financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables, and derivative financial 
instruments.
 
Subsequent measurement
 
The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as follows: 
 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
 
Fair value through profit or loss category comprises financial liabilities that are derivatives financial instrument (except for a 
derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument) and financial liabilities that 
are specifically designated into this category upon initial recognition. 
 
Financial liabilities categorised as fair value through profit or loss are subsequently measured at their fair value with gains or 
losses recognised in the profit or loss. 
 
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost
 
Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method (see 
Note 2.6(vi)).
 
Gains and losses are recognised in the profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation 
process.

Financial instruments (continued)
 
(iii) Financial guarantee contracts
 
A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a 
loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.
 
 
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Financial guarantee contracts are amortised on a straight-line basis over the 
contractual period of the debt instrument. Where the guarantee does not have a specific period, the guarantee will only be 
recognised in the profit or loss upon discharge of the guarantee.
 
When settlement of a financial guarantee contract becomes probable, an estimate of the obligation is made. If the carrying 
value of the financial guarantee contract is lower than the obligation, the carrying value is adjusted to the obligation amount 
and accounted for as a provision. 
 
(iv) Derivative financial instruments 
 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward rate contracts to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in 
foreign currency exchange rates.
 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into 
and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives financial instruments are carried as financial assets when the fair 
value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives financial instruments during the financial year are recognised 
in the profit or loss.
 
An embedded derivative is recognised separately from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative if, and only if, it is 
not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the host contract is not categorised as fair 
value through profit or loss. The host contract, in the event an embedded derivative is recognised separately, is accounted for 
in accordance with the policy applicable to the nature of the host contract.
 
In general, contracts to sell or purchase non-financial items to meet expected own use requirements are not accounted for 
as financial instruments. However, contracts to sell or purchase commodities that can be net settled or which contain written 
options are required to be recognised at fair value, with gains and losses recognised in the profit or loss.
(v) 
Offsetting of financial instruments
 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statements of financial position if, and 
only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net 
basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
(vi) Amortised cost of financial instruments
 
Amortised cost is computed using the effective interest method. This method uses effective interest rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of 
the financial instrument. Amortised cost takes into account any transaction costs and any discount or premium on settlement.

Financial instruments (continued)
(vii) Derecognition of financial instruments
 
Financial assets
 
A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or, the Group or the 
Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash 
flows in full without material delay to a third party under a “pass-through” arrangement without retaining control of the asset 
or substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset.
 
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received 
(including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in 
equity is recognised in the profit or loss.
 
Financial liabilities
 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired. On derecognition 
of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liabilities extinguished or transferred to 
another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the 
profit or loss.
2.7 
Fair value measurements
 
Fair value of an asset or a liability, except for lease transactions, is determined as the price that would be received to sell an asset 
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The measurement 
assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market or in the absence of a 
principal market, in the most advantageous market. 
 
The fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted 
market bid prices at the close of business at the end of reporting date. For financial instruments where there is no active market, 
fair value is determined using valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm’s length market transactions, 
reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other 
valuation models. Where fair value cannot be reliably estimated, assets are carried at cost less impairment losses, if any.
 
For non-financial asset, the fair value measurement takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits 
by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and 
best use. 
 
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group or the Company uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair 
values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the input used in the valuation technique as follows:
• 
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identifiable assets or liabilities.
• 
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  
               (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
• 
Level 3 – Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable input).
 
The Group and the Company recognise transfer between levels of fair value hierarchy as of the date of the event or change in 
circumstances that caused the transfers.

2.8 
Impairment
(i) 
Financial assets
 
All financial assets (except for financial assets categorised as fair value through profit or loss, and investments in subsidiaries, 
joint ventures and associates) are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence of 
impairment as a result of one or more events having an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset. If any such 
objective evidence exists, then the financial asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Losses expected as a result of future 
events, no matter how likely, are not recognised.
 
An impairment loss in respect of loans and receivables is recognised in profit or loss and is measured as the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective 
interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account. 
 
If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event 
occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss is reversed, to the extent that the 
asset’s carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not been recognised 
at the date the impairment is reversed. The amount of the reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
(ii) 
Other assets
 
The carrying amounts of other assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. The carrying amounts are reviewed more frequently if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired, as described in the respective assets’ accounting 
policies.
 
If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying 
amount of an asset or the cash-generating unit to which it belongs exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the profit or loss.
 
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows from continuing use that are largely 
independent from other assets and groups. An impairment loss recognised in respect of a cash-generating unit is allocated first 
to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other 
assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
 
The recoverable amount is the greater of the asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. In assessing value in 
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed in the subsequent period. In respect of other assets, impairment 
losses are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss 
is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
 
Reversals of impairment losses are credited to the profit or loss in the financial year in which the reversals are recognised.
2.9 
Inventories
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes raw material costs and production overheads and 
is determined on a weighted average basis. 
 
 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
 
Cost of stores, spares and others consists of the invoiced value from suppliers and import duty charges and is determined on a 
weighted average basis.

2.10 Cash and cash equivalents
 
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and bank balances, deposits with licensed financial institutions and highly liquid 
investments which have an insignificant risk of changes in fair value with original maturities of three months or less, and are used by 
the Group and the Company in the management of their short term commitments. For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, 
cash and cash equivalents are presented net of bank overdrafts and deposits restricted, if any.
2.11 Provisions
 
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group or the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that 
can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Future 
operating losses are not provided for. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future net cash flows at a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, 
the accretion in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as finance cost. 
 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the net expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the 
reporting date. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
 
Possible obligations, whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events not 
wholly within the control of the Group, are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed as contingent liabilities unless 
the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote.
2.12 Employee benefits
(i) 
Short term employee benefits
 
Wages and salaries, bonuses and social security contributions are recognised as an expense in the financial year in which the 
associated services are rendered by employees of the Group and the Company.
(ii) 
Defined contribution plans
 
As required by law, companies in Malaysia make contributions to the state pension scheme, the Employees Provident Fund 
(EPF). Such contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss as incurred.
2.13 Taxation
 
Tax on the profit or loss for the financial year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the profit or 
loss. 
 
(i) 
Current tax
 
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the financial year, using the statutory tax rates at 
the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous financial years.
(ii) 
Deferred tax
 
Deferred tax is provided for, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for 
all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, unabsorbed 
capital allowances, unused reinvestment allowances, unused investment tax allowances, unused tax losses and other unused 
tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences, unabsorbed capital allowances, unused reinvestment allowances, unused investment tax allowances, unused tax 
losses and other unused tax credits can be utilised.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.13 Taxation (continued)
(ii) 
Deferred tax (continued)
 
Deferred tax is not recognised for the initial recognition of goodwill and the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction which is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit nor loss.
 
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and 
they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, where they 
intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously. 
 
Deferred tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting date and is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
the future taxable profit will be available against which the related tax benefit can be realised.
2.14 Foreign currency transactions
 
In preparing the financial statements of individual entities in the Group, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are translated to the functional currencies at rates of exchange ruling on the transaction dates.
 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date have been retranslated to the functional 
currency at rates ruling on the reporting date.
 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies which are measured at fair value are retranslated to the 
functional currency at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currency are not retranslated at the reporting date.
 
Gains and losses on exchange arising from retranslation are recognised in the profit or loss, except for differences arising on the 
retranslation of available-for-sale equity instruments, which are recognised in equity.
 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than Ringgit Malaysia are translated into 
Ringgit Malaysia at the exchange rates ruling at reporting date.
 
The income and expenses are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions or an average rate that approximates 
those rates. All resulting exchange differences are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve within equity.
 
In the consolidated financial statements, when settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to the Group’s foreign 
operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary 
item are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are reclassified to other comprehensive income 
and presented under foreign currency translation reserve in equity. Upon disposal of the investment, the cumulative exchange 
differences previously recorded in equity are reclassified to the consolidated profit or loss.

2.15 Revenue
 
Revenue from the sale of petrochemical products and their related products in the course of ordinary activities is measured at fair 
value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns and allowances, trade discounts and volume rebates. Revenue is 
recognised when persuasive evidence exists, usually in the form of an executed sales agreement, that the significant risk and rewards 
of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible 
return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of 
revenue can be measured reliably. If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount can be measured reliably, then the 
discount is recognised as a reduction of revenue as the sales are recognised.
 
Dividend income is recognised in the profit or loss on the date the right to receive payment is established.
 
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the profit or loss based on the actual and estimated throughput volume and port 
charges.
2.16 Interest income
 
Income arising from assets yielding interest are recognised on a time proportion basis that takes into account the effective yield on 
the assets.
2.17 Financing costs
 
Finance costs comprise interest payable on borrowings and profit share margin on Islamic financing facilities, as well as any accretion 
in provision due to the passage of time.
 
All interest and other costs incurred in connection with borrowings are expensed as incurred, other than borrowing cost directly 
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets (assets that necessarily take a substantial period of 
time to get ready for their intended use or sale), which are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
 
The capitalisation of borrowing costs as part of the cost of a qualifying asset commences when expenditure for the assets is being 
incurred, borrowing costs are being incurred and activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale are 
in progress. Capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended or ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the 
qualifying asset for its intended use or sale are interrupted or completed.
 
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is 
deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
2.18  Equity instruments
 
Instruments classified as equity are measured at cost on initial recognition and are not remeasured subsequently.
(i) 
Issue expenses
Costs directly attributable to the issue of instruments classified as equity are recognised as a deduction from equity.
(ii) 
Ordinary shares 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
2.19  Basic earnings per ordinary share
The Group presents basic earnings per share data for its ordinary shares.
 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year.
2.20 Operating segment
 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses (including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the components of the Group, and for which 
discrete financial information is available) whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker, 
which in this case is the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer (MD/CEO), to make decisions about resources to be allocated to 
the segments and to assess the performance of the Group.

The increase in investments in unquoted shares was mainly due to the conversion of the Company’s loan due from a subsidiary amounting 
to RM5,123 million or USD1,254 million into equity via the issuance of 5,123 million of redeemable preference shares.
 
In the previous financial year, the Group cancelled an elastomers project which was to be undertaken by a subsidiary as part of the RAPID 
project in Pengerang, Johor. Consequently, the Company impaired the total investment in the subsidiary amounting to RM255 million.
 
Summarised financial information of non-controlling interests has not been included as the non-controlling interests of the subsidiaries are

assumption that certain subsidiaries will generate sufficient profits upon the implementation of tolling arrangements within the Group’s 
integrated value chain.

Ministry of Finance.

OPERATING SEGMENTS
 
For management purposes, the Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic business units. The 
strategic business units offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different technology and 
marketing strategies. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments:
• 
Olefins and Derivatives – activities include manufacturing and marketing of a wide range of olefin and polymer products, which are 
used as basic feedstock for other products, to intermediate products including basic and high performance chemicals.
• 
Fertilisers and Methanol – activities include manufacturing and marketing methanol and a range of nitrogen, phosphate and 
compound fertilisers.  
 
Management monitors the operating results of the business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation 
and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss and is measured consistently with 
operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. 
 
Performance is measured based on segment profit after tax as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the 
Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer (MD/CEO), who is the Group’s chief operating decision maker. Segment profit is used to measure 
performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the segments relative to other

Financial risk management 
 
The Group and the Company are exposed to various financial risks that are particular to its core business of petrochemical. These risks, 
which arise in the normal course of the Group’s and the Company’s business, comprise credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk relating to 
interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices.
 
The Group adopts PETRONAS Group Risk Management Framework and Guideline that sets the foundation for the establishment of 
effective risk management across the Group.
 
Risk taking activities are undertaken within acceptable level of risk or risk appetite, whereby the risk appetite level reflects business 
considerations and capacity to assume such risks. The risk appetite is established at Board level, where relevant, based on defined 
methodology and translated into operational thresholds.
 
 
The Group’s and the Company’s goal in risk management is to ensure that the management understands, measures and monitors the 
various risks that arise in connection with their operations. Policies and guidelines have been developed to identify, analyse, appraise and 
monitor the dynamic risks facing the Group and the Company. Based on this assessment, each business unit/Company adopts appropriate 
measures to mitigate these risks in accordance with the business unit’s/Company’s view of the balance between risk and reward.

Credit risk
 
Credit risk is the potential exposure of the Group and the Company to losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties. The Group’s 
and the Company’s exposures to credit risk arise principally from its receivables from customers and intercompany loans and advances. 
Credit risks are controlled by individual operating units in line with PETRONAS Group Risk Management Framework and Guideline.  
Intercompany loans and advances
 
The Company provides unsecured loans and advances to subsidiaries. The Company monitors the results of the subsidiaries regularly. As 
at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the statements of 
financial position.
Receivables
 
The Group minimises credit risk by ensuring that all potential counterparties are subject to credit assessment and approval prior to any 
transaction being concluded. Existing counterparties are also subject to regular reviews, including re-appraisal and approval of granted 
limits. The creditworthiness of counterparties is assessed based on an analysis of all available quantitative and qualitative data regarding 
business risks and financial standing, together with the review of any relevant third party and market information. Reports are prepared 
and presented to the management that cover the Group’s and the Company’s overall credit exposure against limits and securities, exposure 
by segment and overall quality of the portfolio.
 
Depending on the types of transactions and counterparty creditworthiness, the Group further mitigates and limits risks related to credit by 
requiring collateral or other credit enhancements such as cash deposits, letter of credit or bank guarantees. 
 
Exposure to losses increases with concentrations of credit risk which may exist when a number of counterparties are involved in similar 
activities or operate in the same industry sector or geographical area, which may result in their ability to meet contractual obligations 
being impacted by changes in economic, political or other conditions.
 
The Group’s significant concentration of credit risk for receivables at the end of the reporting date by segment is as follows:

45
2,090
2,092
 
As at the end of the financial year, the maximum exposure to credit risk arising from receivables is equal to the carrying amount. The Group 
uses ageing analysis to monitor the credit quality of trade receivables. The Group has taken reasonable steps to ensure that receivables that 
are neither past due nor impaired are stated at their realisable values. 
 
The ageing of trade receivables and amount due from PETRONAS, related companies and associates which are trade in nature as at the 
end of the financial year is analysed below:

Credit risk (continued)
Financial guarantee
 
The Company provides unsecured financial guarantee to bank in respect of banking facility granted to an associate. The Company monitors 
on an ongoing basis, the results of the associate and repayments made by the associate.
 
The maximum exposure to credit risk is amounting to RM390 million (2016: Nil) which represents the outstanding banking facility of the 
associate as at reporting date. As at reporting date, there was no indication that the associate would default on repayment. 
Liquidity risk
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligationas as they fall due. The Group’s 
and the Company’s exposure to liquidity risk arises principally from its trade and other payables and borrowings. In managing its liquidity 
risk, the Group monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate by management to finance the Group’s and 
the Company’s operations and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows.

Market risk
 
Market risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from changes in market prices and their impact on the performance of the business. The market 
price changes arising from financial instruments that the Group and the Company are exposed to includes interest rates and foreign 
currency exchange rates that could adversely affect the value of the Group’s and the Company’s financial assets, liabilities or expected 
future cash flows.
Interest rate risk
 
The Group’s and the Company’s variable rate instruments are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates 
whilst fixed rate instruments are exposed to a risk of change in their fair value due to changes in interest rates. Short term receivables and 
payables are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.
 
In managing interest rate risk, the Group and the Company maintain a balanced portfolio of fixed and floating rate instruments. All 
interest rate exposures are monitored and managed proactively based on adopted PETRONAS Group Risk Management Framework and 
Guideline.

The Group’s and the Company’s financial assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost, any reasonable possible change in interest 
rate is not expected to have material impact on the Group’s and the Company’s profit or loss.
Foreign exchange risk
 
The Group and the Company are exposed to varying levels of foreign exchange risk when they enter into transactions that are not 
denominated in the respective companies’ functional currencies and when foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated 
at the reporting date. The main underlying economic currencies of the Group’s and the Company’s cash flows are Ringgit Malaysia and US 
Dollar.
 
The Group’s and the Company’s foreign exchange management policies are to minimise economic and significant transactional exposures 
arising from currency movements. The Group mainly relies on the natural hedge arising from most of its revenue and expenses being 
denominated in US Dollar. In addition, the Group, where applicable, hedges using derivative instruments in respect of current and 
forecasted transactions.

Price risk 
 
The Group is exposed to price risks that include feedstock and product price risk and basis risk which may affect the value of the Group’s 
assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. Price risk is the risk of financial loss due to fluctuation and volatility of feedstock prices 
on purchases and product prices on trades. Basis risk, on the other hand, is the risk of financial loss as a result of different pricing term of 
trades.
 
The Group is guided by industry practices and minimises its price risk exposure by proactively and continuously identifying, measuring, 
monitoring, mitigating and reporting price risk within the context of a comprehensive risk management framework.

i. 
MFRS 9 Financial Instruments
 
 
MFRS 9 replaces the guidance in MFRS 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement on the classification and measurement 
of financial assets and financial liabilities, impairment of financial assets, and on hedge accounting.
 
The Group has established a structured implementation program which includes undertaking impact assessment, guideline, training 
program as well as engaging with relevant experts within PETRONAS Group to ensure readiness and smooth implementation of MFRS 9.
 
MFRS 9 contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model in which assets 
are managed and their cash flow characteristics. MFRS 9 also introduces a new impairment model with a forward-looking expected 
credit loss (ECL) model. 
 
Based on the assessment, the Group and the Company do not expect the application of MFRS 9 to have a significant impact on its 
consolidated financial statements, other than the disclosure impact of which the Group and the Company are finalising.

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of PETRONAS Chemicals Group Berhad (“PCG”), which comprise the statements of financial position 
as at 31 December 2017 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statements of 
changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies, as set out on pages 154 to 217.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as 
at 31 December 2017, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial 
Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section 
of our auditors’ report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities
We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the 
Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants (“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of 
the Group and of the Company for the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of 
the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
We have determined that there is no key audit matter in the audit of the separate financial statements of the Company to communicate in our 
auditors’ report.
Deferred tax assets
Refer to note 2.13(ii) (accounting policy) and note 9 of the financial statements.
Where deferred tax assets are recognised, significant management judgment is required to assess the utilisation of the balance by reference to 
projections of future taxable income. The periods over which the deferred tax assets are expected to be recovered can be extensive. This is one 
of the areas that our audit focuses on because there are inherent uncertainties involved in projecting future taxable income, in particular, when 
the deferred tax assets are recognised by subsidiaries which continue to be loss making.
We performed the following audit procedures, among others:
•  
assessed the adequacy of the audit procedures performed by the component auditors (which included amongst others, challenging the key 
assumptions, testing mathematical accuracy and assessing reasonableness of taxable income projections) to review the recognised deferred 
tax asset as two of the subsidiaries in the Group that had recognised significant deferred tax assets are audited by another firm of auditors; 
and
•  
evaluated the likelihood of successful implementation of the proposed tolling arrangements within the Group’s integrated value chain 
involving the aforesaid two subsidiaries and evaluated the appropriateness of the Group’s assessment that it is probable that sufficient 
taxable income would be generated to utilise the deferred tax assets.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF PETRONAS CHEMICALS GROUP BERHAD (COMPANY NO. 459830-K) (INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA)
Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the 
Directors’ Report and Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control (but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of 
the Company and our auditors’ report thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this auditors’ report, and the remaining parts of the 
Annual Report, which are expected to be made available to us after the auditors’ report date.
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not and will not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group 
and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we 
have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors’ report, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
When we read the remaining parts of the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to the directors of the Company and take appropriate actions in accordance with approved standards on auditing in 
Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing.
Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and 
fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and 
of the Company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative 
but to do so.
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and 
International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise 
professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
• 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control of the Group and of the 
Company.
• 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by 
the Directors.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF PETRONAS CHEMICALS GROUP BERHAD (COMPANY NO. 459830-K) (INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA)
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)
•  
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group or of 
the Company to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in 
our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. 
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
•  
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the 
disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that gives a true and fair view.
•  
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to 
express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our 
auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine 
that a matter should not be communicated in our auditors’ report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected 
to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not acted as 
auditors are disclosed in note 26 to the financial statements.
Other Matter
This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and 
for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

• 
Resolution 5 – The proposed Ordinary Resolution 5 is to approve the Directors’ Fees and Allowances payable to the  
Non-Executive Directors of up to an amount of RM2.6 million with effect from 1 January 2018 until the next AGM of the 
Company. The fees structure of the Non-Executive Directors of the Company is as follows:
- 
Monthly fixed fees for duties as Director/Chairman; 
- 
Meeting and attendance allowance for each Board/Board Committee attended; and
- 
Fuel Allowance.
 
The Directors’ fees and meeting allowances for Non-Independent Non-Executive Directors who are also employees of Petroliam 
Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS) are paid directly to PETRONAS.
 
The shareholders at the last AGM held on 26 April 2017 approved the Directors’ Fees of RM1,500,000 for the period from  
1 January 2017 until the next AGM of the Company. The actual Directors’ Fees and other benefits paid to the Non-Executive 
Directors for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 is RM1,019,000.
 
The Directors’ fees for the Non-Executive Directors for the period from 1 January 2018 until the conclusion of the next Annual 
General Meeting are estimated not to exceed RM2.6 million. The calculation is based on the estimated number of scheduled 
Board and Board Committees’ meetings and on assumption that all the Non-Executive Directors will remain in office until the 
next AGM. This resolution is to facilitate payment of the Directors’ Fees for financial year 2018/2019.
 
The Board will seek shareholders’ approval at the next AGM in the event the Directors’ fees proposed is insufficient. 
 
Details of the fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 are published on the

Sustainable Value Creation & Material Factors 
Every day, we work towards creating safe, secure, and cleaner 
energy whilst striving towards prosperity for all. 
For PETRONAS to deliver value, remain fit for the future and 
generate positive societal impacts, our actions, policies and 
processes need to be continuously assessed and refined to adapt

FOCUS AREAS
future. We are committed towards ensuring long-term value 
creation, as we equip the organisation with the required skills 
and knowledge to operate in a low-carbon economy. 
As the energy sector is undergoing a phase of rapid transition, 
our sustainability focus is dynamic in nature. We are continuously 
moving forward with better actions to respond to emerging 
risks and opportunities presented to us. These include climate 
change, environmental management, social equity, health and 
safety of our people, protecting human rights, and acting with 
the highest integrity and ethical values. 
Our sustainability focus areas are guided by the PETRONAS Corporate Sustainability Framework (CSF), which defines the areas where 
we have a role to play in managing risks, opportunities, and impacts. The Framework, conceptualised in 2001, was revised in 2016, 
taking into view our business aspirations, the Paris Agreement, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). 
The CSF constitutes nine areas that are applicable to all aspects of our operations, group-wide. This includes our Public Listed 
Companies, where CSF may be adopted and localised to suit the unique business characteristics and needs.

MATERIAL FACTORS
PETRONAS’ material sustainability factors are based on our periodic materiality assessments to ensure the material factors and 
information reported are timely and meaningful and includes input and verification by PETRONAS subject matter experts and data 
owners. As we work towards an integrated reporting format, our reporting processes are constantly reviewed for more efficient and 
effective ways to incorporate financial and non-financial materiality factors.
In preparing our material factors for FY2018, we have structured them to fall under six main topics – Governance & Ethics; Safety; 
Climate Change & Environmental Management; Product Stewardship & Supply Chain; Health, Wellness & Workplace; and Social 
Responsibility. All material factors are accompanied by disclosure management approaches, year-on-year performance data, as well 
as key highlights.
Our materiality factors are aligned with the UN SDGs since it came into effect 
in 2016. The SDGs represent an opportunity for us to prioritise business-led 
solutions that generate the greatest positive impact to society. It enables us to 
build on our efforts towards nation-building and the global sustainability agenda, 
whilst enhancing partnerships to deliver sustainable value creation.
In 2018, we identified seven SDGs that are relevant to our corporate practices. 
Moving forward, we will link the SDGs more closely to our business operations, 
sustainability governance, key performance metrics, and material sustainability 
factors.

“I am honoured to share my first letter 
to stakeholders as the Chairman of 
PETRONAS.”
Chairman
A CHALLENGING, YET REWARDING 
YEAR
2018 was a year of mixed fortunes 
for the oil and gas industry. For most 
part of the year, the price of Brent 
has been in an upward trajectory – 
touching a high of US$86 a barrel in 
early October 2018, before sliding 
down to US$54 a barrel towards 
the end of the year, over fears of 
supply glut amid a weakening global 
economic growth. 
I am honoured and privileged to deliver this annual 
statement, my first, as the Chairman of PETRONAS. 
I am humbled by this appointment and I would like 
to thank Yang Amat Berhormat Tun Dr Mahathir 
Mohamad, Prime Minister of Malaysia, for the trust 
bestowed upon me. I sincerely look forward to 
working with the Board towards delivering  
long-term sustainable value for the Group.
LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN
DEAR 
STAKEHOLDERS,
Despite the challenging external environment, 
PETRONAS delivered a commendable 
performance, chalking a 12 per cent year-
on-year increase in revenue to RM251.0 
billion, while Net Profit rose by 22 per cent 
to RM55.3 billion during the same period. 
The commendable financial performance is 
attributed to the sound strategies put in place 
since 2018, driven by our three-pronged 
strategy of ‘Maximising Cash Generators’, 
‘Expanding Core Business’, and ‘Stepping Out’. 
I am pleased to inform that this financial 
performance has enabled PETRONAS to return 
RM57.8 billion in the form of dividend, taxes, 
cash payments, and export duty to the Federal 
and State Governments of Malaysia. 
REINFORCING SHARED VALUES AND 
GOVERNANCE
One of the key enablers to PETRONAS notable 
performance is its people – firmly guided by 
the organisation’s Shared Values of Loyalty, 
Professionalism, Integrity, and Cohesiveness 
in discharging their responsibility as trustees 
to the people and the nation. These values 
have become the soul of this organisation 
and are instilled in its people the resolve to 
deliver a superior performance and to leave 
DATUK AHMAD NIZAM SALLEH
LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN
We hold the 
nation's 
hydrocarbon 
resources 
in trust and 
we share the 
accountability  
to ensure its  
well-being
a legacy for future generations. Our Shared 
Values has allowed us to establish trust with 
our stakeholders in the businesses we operate 
around the world. 
In this regard, PETRONAS will continue to 
exercise ‘Zero Tolerance’ against any acts 
of corruption or inappropriate conduct in 
accordance with the PETRONAS Code of 
Conduct and Business Ethics. During the year, 
we have intensified our efforts to educate and 
create awareness on the perils of corruption, 
while continuing to enforce the management 
and protection against ethical violation, as 
guided by the PETRONAS Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption Policy and Guidelines. PETRONAS 
will continue to be supportive and attentive to 
Government’s National Anti-Corruption Plan, 
and that of our own, to address challenges 
facing the integrity of our governance.
I would like to take this opportunity to remind 
myself and members of the PETRONAS 
family that we hold the nation’s hydrocarbon 
resources in trust and we share the 
accountability to ensure its well-being, while 
we harness its potential for the benefit of the 
people and the nation.

GIVING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY
As a responsible corporate citizen, PETRONAS defines 
achievement not just within the narrow confines of business 
growth and returns, but also in how we enrich the lives of the 
people, wherever we operate. 
PETRONAS has embarked on more than 500 Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) programmes to date. I am most pleased to 
report that PETRONAS’ CSR heritage, built on decades of active 
volunteerism, philanthropy, and a passion to transform lives, is 
now coordinated by Yayasan PETRONAS, which was launched 
on 1 March 2019, by the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, Yang 
Amat Berhormat Dato’ Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail.
PETRONAS will carry on our tradition by extending and 
expanding PETRONAS’ efforts beyond what we have achieved 
over the years – by delivering programmes focusing on 
three focus areas: Sentuhan Ilmu (Education), Sentuhan Alam 
(Environment), and Sentuhan Harapan (Community Well-being 
and Development). Through our work in these three focus areas, 
we aspire to create an environment ‘Where Good Flourishes’.
A project worthy of mention under Sentuhan Alam is our 
Imbak Canyon Conservation Area, a pristine rainforest rich in 
biodiversity in the heart of Sabah where we carry out world-class 
research and conservation work through our Imbak Canyon 
Studies Centre – in partnership with Yayasan Sabah. We hope we 
will be able to enhance the gene bank for the conservation and 
exploration of pharmaceutical and biotechnological applications 
from plants in this conserved area. 
Sentuhan Harapan is a livelihood programme to uplift the 
standard of living for underprivileged communities. One of 
the initiatives include a six-month training programme for 
participants to equip themselves with the necessary knowledge 
and skills, enabling them to become successful entrepreneurs.
The Sentuhan Ilmu series of programmes aim to improve 
education outcomes and provide more opportunities for 
underpriviledged students, particularly in Science Technology 
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Through the Teachers 
Ambassador Programme, we hope to support their professional 
development opportunities while offering creative teaching and 
classroom strategies. 
LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN
LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN
STRENGTHENING THE TALENT ECOSYSTEM
PETRONAS has always strived to create the 
right environment for our talents to thrive and 
deliver their best. A high-performing, cohesive, 
and collaborative workplace is founded on 
equality, integrity, and merit – irrespective of 
gender, age and nationalities. Our ongoing 
talent development efforts, among others, focus 
on dispelling biases at the workplace, while 
promoting leadership, respect, trust, and honest 
communication.
PETRONAS has embarked on initiatives towards 
instituting greater diversity, inclusiveness, and 
flexibility in the organisation, particularly our 
push for more women leaders within the Group 
through the PETRONAS Leading Women Network 
(PLWN), designed to empower the career growth 
of our women colleagues especially in the 
upstream sector. 
CHANGES TO THE BOARD
On behalf of the Board, I would like to extend a 
warm welcome to the new Board members who 
together with me, joined the Board of PETRONAS 
in 2018. 
These new additions to the Board collectively bring diversity of perspectives, 
a wealth of commercial experience and governance expertise that will be 
crucial to PETRONAS’ transformative journey going forward. 
During the year, my predecessor Tan Sri Mohd Sidek Hassan retired as 
Chairman after completing his tenure on 30 June 2018. On behalf of the 
Board, I would like to record my utmost gratitude for Tan Sri Mohd Sidek 
Hassan and other Board members for their contributions and wish them the 
best on their retirement and their future endeavours.
APPRECIATION
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I wish to record my heartfelt 
appreciation to our stakeholders, including our customers and partners for 
their continued support and trust in PETRONAS. 
I would also like to thank the entire PETRONAS family for the hard work, 
perseverance, commitment and dedication in continuously striving to deliver 
a sustainable performance for PETRONAS amid a challenging business 
environment. PETRONAS has already joined the ranks of global companies, 
and this is the fruit of your efforts. The challenge for us is to continue the 
momentum and bring PETRONAS to greater heights.
I would also like to take this opportunity to extend my gratitude to the 
Government of Malaysia, the State Governments and the Governments of 
PETRONAS’ host countries for their support, as well as to the members of the 
Board of Directors for their wise counsel and guidance.
“I would also like to thank 
the entire PETRONAS 
family for the hard 
work, perseverance, 
commitment 
and dedication in 
continuously striving 
to deliver a sustainable 
performance for 
PETRONAS.“

Annual Report 2018
President and Group Chief 
Executive Officer
“PETRONAS has delivered a robust performance 
for 2018. It was a year where we have executed 
our strategies and delivered excellent results, 
consistent with priorities outlined under our 
three-pronged strategy – despite operating  
in a persistent volatile market.”
ACHIEVED STRONG PERFORMANCE ACROSS 
THE GROUP
2018 was a year of resolute execution for the 
Group where we achieved greater tangible 
results from our ongoing efforts in driving 
efficiency and enhancing our operational 
excellence. Over the last three years, our 
relentless focus on building a more resilient 
and prepared organisation, through our 
three-pronged strategy has paved the way for 
PETRONAS to pursue our growth agenda that 
will continue to deliver value over the long run 
and help future-proof the organisation. 
Our Group Profit After Tax (PAT) for 2018 
increased by 22 per cent to RM55.3 billion 
compared to RM45.5 billion in 2017. In line with 
higher Profit Before Tax at RM76.7 billion, our 
Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and 
Amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 27 per cent to 
RM116.5 billion from RM92.0 billion in 2017. 
Underscored by prudent financial management 
and high fiscal discipline, our improved Cash 
Flows from Operating activities (CFFO) in 2018 
grew to RM86.3 billion from RM75.7 billion in the 
previous year. 
PETRONAS closed the Financial Year with total 
assets of RM636.3 billion, increased by 6 per cent 
from RM599.8 billion in 2017; while cash and 
fund investments stood at RM181 billion. Overall, 
PETRONAS maintained a strong credit rating and 
a healthy cash flow in 2018. Our sizable cash 
reserves, a result of sound capital management, 
allowed us to declare a RM30 billion special 
dividend to our shareholders, as announced 
in 2018, which we will distribute in tranches 
throughout 2019. 
Our strong financial position has allowed us to 
continuously invest and our capital expenditure 
(CAPEX) for the year totalled RM46.8 billion, 
mainly attributed to various Upstream projects 
and our largest domestic investment to date 
– the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) in 
Johor, Malaysia. 
Throughout the year, PETRONAS continued to 
stay on course in delivering strong performance 
for both the Upstream and Downstream 
businesses. For PETRONAS’ Upstream business, 
we recorded improved operational performance 
with several discoveries which has strengthened 
our portfolio growth. Ten exploration discoveries 
were made with nine of these in Malaysia and 
one overseas, contributing to an increase in our 
hydrocarbon resources. 
For the Downstream business, we sustained commendable 
operations and delivered a good overall performance in 2018 
for our refining and petrochemical plants. On the retail side, 
PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad (PDB) continued to innovate 
product offerings to deliver enhanced retail experience for 
our customers through the utilisation of technology and 
digitalisation with the launch of its e-payment app, Setel, and its 
mobile fuel delivery service, ROVR. The PIC project continues to 
record excellent progress and has achieved 97 per cent as at  
31 December 2018 with current progress at 99 per cent as at end 
of March 2019. Other key highlights will be shared further in the 
Upstream and Downstream sections of the Annual Report. 
Our three-pronged strategy of maximising our cash generators, 
expanding our core business and stepping out to new energy 
and specialty chemicals, continues to set the course for 
PETRONAS and we have made significant headway in carrying 
out these strategies. Notable milestones include our successful 
acquisition of a 10 per cent stake in Block 61 of the Khazzan field 
in Oman as well as the approved Final Investment Decision (FID) 
for the LNG Canada project in Kitimat, British Columbia with 
our joint venture partners which would allow us to monetise 
our world-class shale gas resources in Canada. Progress on the 
development phase of our shale oil asset in La Amarga Chica, 
Argentina is also encouraging. 
While we forged ahead with our growth strategies, we continue 
to remain focused on our ongoing transformation initiatives 
which commenced approximately three years ago. One of these 
Over the last three years, our 
relentless focus on building a 
more resilient and prepared 
organisation, through our three-
pronged strategy has paved the 
way for PETRONAS to pursue our 
growth agenda that will continue 
to deliver value over the long 
run and help future-proof the 
organisation.

activities, the Cost Reduction Alliance (CORAL 2.0), achieved an 
overall reported value of RM3.6 billion in 2018, bringing the total 
since its inception in 2015 to RM15.1 billion. This is a testament to 
the collaborative synergy between PETRONAS and our industry 
partners in generating value from various activities to drive down 
costs and improve productivity. 
Internally, our CACTUS Cash initiatives also generated a 
cumulative RM14.2 billion in savings by end of last year. I am 
pleased to share that at the end of 2018, both of these initiatives 
have been concluded and the institutionalised practices will be 
adopted as part of our business-as-usual arrangements. 
HSSE
In 2018, PETRONAS showed a marked improvement in our 
Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE) performance. 
A concerted focus was placed on building a generative HSSE 
culture, one that is built on ownership, mindfulness, and 
intervention, where everyone contributes towards adopting the 
right conduct for ‘zero tolerance’ on worksite incidents.
Whilst clocking a record-breaking 468 million man hours in 
2018, we succeeded in reducing our fatality rate, major Loss of 
Primary Containment (LOPC), and major fire incidents. 
However, our work is far from done, as rigorous initiatives 
on safety compliance and improving HSE competencies are 
continuously rolled out by the Group HSSE team to reach our 
‘zero incident’ target.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
‘A progressive energy and solutions partner 
enriching lives for a sustainable future.’
NURTURING A ROBUST LOCAL OIL & GAS 
ECOSYSTEM
In our commitment to shape a sustainable oil 
and gas sector in Malaysia, PETRONAS constantly 
seeks innovative solutions for the mutual benefit 
of all parties in the ecosystem – more so in 
the increasing volatile business environment 
we operate in. We actively engaged various 
stakeholders to understand the pain-points of 
the industry in providing specific and customised 
solutions. In this regard, PETRONAS has 
embarked on many industry initiatives to heighten 
the resilience of our local vendors. 
In May 2018, we launched VDPx, an extension of 
our successful Vendor Development Programme 
(VDP), which empowers the next tier of VDP 
contractors to develop their own ecosystem of 
vendors and suppliers to support the growth 
of their businesses, as well as the industry. We 
also published the second edition of our annual 
PETRONAS Activity Outlook in December 2018, 
which outlines our activities in the Upstream and 
Downstream sectors to provide a better line of 
sight on the emerging project requirements for 
the period 2019 to 2021. The intent is to guide 
local Oil & Gas Services and Equipment (OGSE) 
companies to strategise their resources and 
investment decisions in line with the industry and 
market trends.
Realising that access to financing is one of 
the prominent pain-points of the industry, we 
reached out to financial institutions and successfully inked a collaboration 
in July 2018 with Bank Islam and Syarikat Jaminan Pembiayaan Perniagaan, 
which targeted a financing programme for Small Medium Enterprise (SME) 
OGSE vendors. Continuing these efforts into 2019, we introduced Program 
Lestari in January, an initiative targeted to increase the capabilities of 
Bumiputra vendors and in February we progressed with the launch of our 
second Vendor Financing Programme for Subcontractors, Mid-tier and Large 
Companies. Under this initiative, contractors will be able to benefit from 
the competitive rates and efficient financing processes from five local and 
international banks.
Moving forward, we remain committed to nurturing the OGSE players and 
enablers to ensure a thriving local oil and gas industry in Malaysia. 
REINFORCING OUR SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENTS
PETRONAS is committed to reduce our carbon footprint and has introduced 
our Carbon Commitments targets back in 2012. Greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions reduction target then was 8 million tCO2e to be achieved by 2017, 
and was focused on reducing flaring and venting, and improvement on energy 
efficiency.
The target of 8 million tCO2e reduction was duly 
achieved in 2017 and PETRONAS continued 
the momentum. As at the end of 2018, our 
cumulative reduction stood at 11.61 million 
tonnes of GHG which translated to 187 mmscfd 
of sales gas.
To date, PETRONAS has enhanced its Carbon 
Commitments to include the management of 
high CO2 gas fields, and requirements on carbon 
pricing and carbon offsets in our decision-
making, as well as inclusion of renewable 
energy sources as a new growth segment. 
Operationally, we continue to strive for zero 
continuous venting and reduce continuous 
flaring of our facilities where economically 
feasible. We target to achieve zero continuous 
venting and zero continuous flaring by 2024 and 
2030 respectively. 
In efforts to strengthen our environmental 
responsibility, PETRONAS is also exploring 
potential carbon offsets from forest conservation 
in Malaysia, besides the commitment to reduce 
flaring and venting, and improve energy 
efficiency. Advancing operational discipline, 
capability, and harnessing technological 
development will be key to PETRONAS in 
managing our GHG emissions, moving forward.
Further to these initiatives, we continue 
to contribute to the nation in the areas 
of education, community well-being and 
development and environment. Over the years, 
we have carried out many Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) programmes and initiatives 
in these areas. I am proud to note that Yayasan 
PETRONAS, the philanthropic foundation of
our company launched in March 2019, will
continue our CSR initiatives across the nation 
in upholding our ‘amanah’ to all Malaysians. 
I am confident that the foundation will shape our 
community efforts with the aim to contribute to 
a sustainable ecosystem that meets the current 
and future needs of societies. 
STRATEGIC OUTLOOK IN 2019 AND BEYOND
The strong performance of 2018 was a 
reflection of the Group’s collective efforts in 
increased operational efficiency and commercial 
excellence. We also continued to remain 
steadfast in our fiscal discipline with enhanced 
operations to deliver commendable results in the 
year under review. 
Looking beyond the horizon, there are many external challenges that 
require us to remain agile and persevere with our efforts to strengthen the 
organisation. Changing market dynamics and consumer demands, along 
with the challenges and disruptions from the energy transition, digital and 
techonological advancements, are some of the issues that the industry would 
have to increasingly grapple with. 
Therefore, in 2019 and the coming years, we will continue in our relentless 
pursuit to drive high performance, efficiency and operational excellence in 
executing our strategies. With a view to leverage global trends and to  
future-proof the organisation, we will remain focused on our cash generators, 
expanding our core business portfolio and exploring opportunities in new 
energy and specialty chemicals. 
In addition, to meet the greater expectation that demands a shift towards 
more sustainable ways of providing cleaner energy to the world beyond profit, 
I believe that the time is right for PETRONAS to adopt a new Statement of 
Purpose in place of the Vision and Mission which has served us all these years. 
As we move forward, our new Statement of Purpose will reflect the dynamic 
growth and innovation we are aspiring to, as well as directing us towards new 
ways of achieving distinctive business outcomes and anticipating the needs of 
customers. It also signals the expansion of our portfolio beyond traditional oil 
and gas into the broader energy space. It is with pleasure for me to introduce 
the new PETRONAS Statement of Purpose: 
As we embark on this new journey, we will continue to push the boundaries 
in enhancing our value proposition to responsibly harness the good in energy 
towards achieving a higher cause. In the pursuit of our progressive aspirations, 
we will sustain the momentum in the focused execution of our strategies to 
deliver value to our stakeholders and ensure a better energy future for the 
generations to come. 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
The accomplishments of the past year would not have been made possible 
without the highly competent, passionate and motivated employees of 
PETRONAS who possess the mindset to diligently pursue high performance 
and continue to push the envelope. I would like to express my appreciation to 
the hardworking men and women of PETRONAS for their perseverance and 
selfless contributions throughout the years. 
Let me also extend my gratitude to our Chairman, YBhg Datuk Ahmad Nizam 
Salleh and all the Members of the PETRONAS Board of Directors for their 
continued support and stewardship of the company. I would also like to extend 
my appreciation to all of our business partners, vendors, and stakeholders that 
have contributed towards our Shared Success.
I look forward to an equally exciting and rewarding year ahead with everyone – 
as a winning PETRONAS team.

LETTER FROM THE EXECUTIVE  
VICE PRESIDENT AND GROUP  
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
Executive Vice President and 
Group Chief Financial Officer
PETRONAS Group concluded 2018 with a 
strong financial position and healthy liquidity, 
underpinned by a resilient performance that 
delivered improved cash flows from operational 
excellence. The Group continues to be 
grounded on prudent financial and solid capital 
management to ensure the implementation 
of our future growth plans and development 
strategies remain firmly on track.
PETRONAS registered higher revenue at 
RM251.0 billion for FY2018, representing an 
increase of 12 per cent compared with the 
previous year on the back of higher average 
realised prices for all key products. The higher 
revenue was partially offset by the unfavourable 
effects of the strengthening of the Ringgit 
against the US Dollar exchange rate, and to a 
lesser extent, lower sales volume.
The upward trend of major product prices 
was largely driven by Dated Brent averaging at 
USD71/bbl in 2018, compared with USD54/bbl 
in 2017. Average prices for LNG benchmark – 
the Japan Customs-Cleared Crude price –  
also went up from USD51/bbl a year ago to  
USD68/bbl in 2018.
REVIEW OF 2018 
FINANCIAL RESULTS
YM TENGKU MUHAMMAD TAUFIK TENGKU AZIZ
LETTER FROM THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT 
AND GROUP CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
Total Upstream production in FY2018 was at 
2,361 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (boe) 
per day, a slight increase of two per cent from 
2,320 thousand boe per day in 2017, mainly 
due to higher production from international 
operations.
In line with higher revenue, Profit After Tax (PAT) 
grew by 22 per cent to RM55.3 billion, compared 
with RM45.5 billion a year ago, primarily 
attributed to better average realised prices for 
key products, and net impairment write-back 
due to better Upstream assets performance 
and outlook. Earnings Before Interest, Tax, 
Depreciation, and Amortisation (EBITDA) also 
increased by 27 per cent year-on-year to 
RM116.5 billion from RM92.0 billion in FY2017,  
in line with higher Profit Before Tax (PBT).

Certain financial information and its corresponding financial ratios have been restated due to the change in accounting policies with respect to revenue 
reporting and inventory valuation for gas trading activities.
The year’s stronger financial performance translated into further 
improvements across two key financial ratios. In particular, the 
Group’s ROTA and ROACE moved up to 11.8 per cent and  
12.0 per cent, respectively. This was mainly driven by higher 
profits generated during the year. 
However, our gearing ratio increased to 19.7 per cent, compared 
with 16.1 per cent registered in 2017, due to additional provision 
for decommissioning of assets following a necessary revision of 
estimated abandonment costs for oil and gas properties, as well 
as lower shareholders’ equity.
PETRONAS’ credit rating remained stable throughout 2018, 
supported by our solid liquidity profile. This was attested by our 
unchanged ratings accorded by all three major rating agencies. 
PETRONAS retained its A-rating by both Standard and Poor’s 
and Fitch, and continued to be rated A1 by Moody’s. 
FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY
PETRONAS’ financial position remained robust, supported by 
improved liquidity from higher revenue and productivity. Total 
assets grew by RM36.5 billion or 6 per cent year-on-year to 
RM636.3 billion as at 31 December 2018, due to increased cash, 
funds, and other investments. The resilient cash position of the 
Group continued to afford us the financial flexibility needed to 
execute our growth and sustainability ambitions.
To further strengthen our integrated business value chain and 
secure new cash generators, PETRONAS spent RM46.8 billion 
for capital investments during the year. Out of this amount, 
54 per cent was for domestic projects, predominantly in the 
Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) project in Pengerang, 
Johor. The project’s completion remains well on track at 
97 per cent, as at 31 December 2018. Capital investments 
for international ventures were primarily spent on Upstream 
ventures in Oman and Canada.

Capital Management
The Group believes that sound capital and 
financial management practices are essential to 
its continued sustainability. Hence, PETRONAS 
remains committed to a policy of financial 
prudence, as outlined in the PETRONAS Group 
Corporate Financial Policy. 
The objective of the Group’s capital 
management strategy is to always maintain 
an optimal capital structure and ensure that at 
any given time, there is sufficient availability of 
funds to meet our financial obligations, support 
business growth, and maximise our shareholders’ 
value. The Group continuously monitors and 
vigilantly maintains a prudent ‘total debt vs 
total assets’ ratio to ensure strict compliance 
with all financial covenants and internal control 
measures.
The balance sheet management 
and financial policy employed by 
PETRONAS ensured the Group’s 
current and future viability. This is 
further supplemented by ongoing 
efforts to achieve the right capital 
structure, implement prudent risk 
mitigation measures, optimised assets 
monetisation, and value accretion 
through high-performing assets.
There were no changes to the Group’s 
capital and financial management 
approach during the year. 
Managing Risks 
Key financial risks which arose in the 
normal course of conducting business 
comprised mainly of credit, liquidity 
and market risks. These are explained 
further in the Notes to the Financial 
Statements that accompany this 
report as part of Note 40 on Financial 
Instruments.
Our approach and strategy in 
managing material risks are described 
in greater detail in our Statement on 
Risk Management and Internal Control,

Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS)
Annual Report 2018
The Group has two core business segments, namely Upstream and Downstream. The other segment, which is Corporate and 
Others, comprises primarily our logistics and maritime sector, property sector, central treasury, and project delivery and technology 
function. Upstream, and Corporate and Others both recorded an increase in PAT in 2018.
PAT BY BUSINESS SEGMENTS
(In RM billion)
Upstream
The Upstream business segment 
continued to be the main contributor to 
the Group’s PAT, representing 75 per cent 
of the Group’s PAT in FY2018. Upstream’s 
PAT improved by 42 per cent from 
RM29.3 billion in FY2017 to RM41.5 billion 
in FY2018, on the back of higher revenue 
and net write-back of impairment on 
assets. The increase in revenue was 
attributed to higher benchmark prices, 
coupled with a two per cent rise in total 
production. 
In 2018, focused execution on growth 
strategies led to the successful acquisition 
of Block 61 Oman which contributed 
to increased production, coupled with 
higher volume mainly from Turkmenistan. 
The production increase was partially 
offset by lower gas production from 
Malaysia resulting from a Sabah-Sarawak 
Gas Pipeline (SSGP) incident. 
Upstream’s continued focus on 
operational excellence, cost optimisation, 
as well as monetising maximum value 
from new and existing fields culminated 
in an increase in the Upstream’s 
contribution to the Group’s bottom line. 
Further details on Upstream’s operational 
performance is described in pages 48 to 53.
Downstream
Downstream Business recorded a revenue 
of RM128.0 billion, 13 per cent higher 
compared with RM113.6 billion recorded 
in FY2017. However, PAT stood at RM8.5 
billion, 25 per cent lower compared 
with RM11.3 billion recorded in FY2017, 
mainly contributed by higher operating 
costs, and lower refining and marketing 
margins. Despite these challenges, we 
persevered in delivering a commendable 
performance. Overall, the performance 
in 2018 yielded an Overall Equipment 
Effectiveness (OEE) of 94.4 per cent, 
whilst Reliability stood at 97.9 per cent.
Our petrochemicals business also 
maintained its solid operating 
performance, registering a high plant 
utilisation rate of 91.9 per cent, with a 
record annual production volume of 
10.4 million metric tonnes, despite heavy 
statutory turnarounds during the financial 
year. 
More information on Downstream’s 
operational performance is available on 
pages 54 to 59.
Corporate and Others
Our Corporate and Others business 
segment recorded a significant jump 
in PAT to RM5.9 billion in FY2018, an 
increase of more than 100 per cent from 
the previous year’s RM1.9 billion. This was 
mainly due to higher fund investment 
income registered during the year.
Over and above fund investment income, 
MISC Berhad (MISC) and KLCC Property 
Holdings Berhad (KLCCP), are the two 
major subsidiaries that contributed to this 
segment PAT. 
MISC recorded a PAT of RM1.3 billion, 
predominantly contributed by LNG 
and Offshore businesses. PAT during 
the year also includes share of profit of 
joint ventures and gains realised from 
acquisition of businesses.
KLCCP recorded a PAT of RM0.8 billion, 
primarily contributed by property 
investment income. 
A comprehensive account of MISC and 
KLCCP’s operational performance can be 
found in their Annual Report for 2018.

Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS)
Annual Report 2018
Capital investments during the financial year 
increased by RM2.3 billion or five per cent, to  
RM46.8 billion, up from RM44.5 billion in FY2017 to 
support the Group’s growth agenda. 
Over the medium term, 
more overseas CAPEX 
will be required to 
unlock the value of our 
foreign assets.
Upstream
The Upstream business segment made up  
58 per cent or RM27.3 billion of the Group’s total 
capital investments in 2018 to sustain and grow 
our production volume. A total of RM18.9 billion 
was allocated towards international portfolio 
growth investments, notably for asset acquisitions 
in Oman and Canada. Of the total Upstream 
capital investments in 2018, domestic investments 
accounted for 31 per cent. Amongst the key 
Upstream investment projects in Malaysia were 
the Baronia Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) Project, 
Balingian and Samarang Asam Paya fields. 
Further details on Upstream capital investments can be 
found on pages 48 to 53.
Downstream
During FY2018, the Downstream business segment 
accounted for 32 per cent of the Group’s total 
capital investments, with the bulk of the Downstream 
investments for the year being spent on the PIC 
project. Completion of PIC remained on track with  
97 per cent progress as at 31 December 2018.  
It is currently in its commissioning stage, preparing 
towards full operations in the fourth quarter of 2019.
More information on Downstream capital 
investments can be referred to pages 54 to 59.
Corporate and Others
Capital investments for our businesses under 
Corporate and Others amounted to RM4.4 billion 
in FY2018, of which 86 per cent was attributed to 
MISC's procurement of five Dynamic Positioning (DP) 
newbuilds and a crude oil tanker – Floating Storage 
and Offloading (FSO) Mekar Bergading. 
Dividends
Taxes
Cash payments
Export Duty
PETRONAS’ contribution to the Federal and State Governments of Malaysia for the year ended 31 December 2018 amounted to 
RM57.8 billion, higher by RM15.1 billion compared with FY2017. 
Dividends paid amounting to RM26.0 billion translated to a dividend 
payout ratio of 69 per cent of the preceding year’s Profit After Tax 
and Non-Controlling Interests. This sum includes dividends totaling 
RM16.0 billion in FY2017, as well as interim dividends of RM5.0 billion 
and special dividends of RM5.0 billion in FY2018. 
The total revenue forgone reached RM254.7 billion in FY2018 since regulated prices came into effect in May 1997. For FY2018, the 
revenue forgone in respect of the regulated pricing mechanism imposed on the supply of gas to Peninsular Malaysia’s power and 
non-power sectors was at RM6.9 billion, compared with the previous year. The increase in revenue forgone was attributed to higher 
contract prices, in line with increase in benchmark prices. 
OUTLOOK
The oil and gas industry will continue to operate in a challenging environment arising from market uncertainties and geopolitical risks. 
Despite these challenges, the Group will continue to focus on upholding its operational excellence and realising growth strategies. 
The Board expects the Group's financial performance for FY2019 to be affected by the movements in prices.

Exploration activities and continuous inventory replenishment is the 
lifeline of PETRONAS as an integrated global oil and gas player. Upstream 
business performed well in 2018 on multiple fronts with notable 
achievements ranging from reserves addition and new discoveries,  
to increased efficiencies and new contracts signed. 
We focused on realising our short-term goals, including harnessing 
leading technology to further uplift cost efficiency and de-risking our 
projects; whilst balancing the execution of medium-to-long-term 
strategies to ensure production sustainability.
Datuk Mohd Anuar Taib
Executive Vice President, and 
Chief Executive Officer, Upstream
Discovering New Resources and Adding New Reserves 
I am pleased to report that Upstream had a strong year in 2018, charting new territories 
as we matured the fields under development.
 
To date, PETRONAS Upstream is operating on 233 producing fields, which is inclusive of 
175 fields domestically and 58 fields internationally. We are expecting 24 new projects in 
our exploration, development, and production pipeline, as well as potential discoveries 
from Malaysia’s deepwater fields in Sabah and Sarawak, Egypt, Gabon, Gambia, Mexico, 
Senegal and Suriname over the next five years.
Through continuous efforts in replenishing our Reserves, overall, we added  
2.69 billion boe (Bboe) of Reserves in 2018, mainly contributed by project approval  
and sanction, better field performance, asset acquisition, and contract extension.  
Taking into consideration in-year production of 0.62 Bboe, PETRONAS’ total Proved  
and Probable (2P) Reserves improved to 8.34 Bboe as at 1 January 2019 from 6.99 Bboe, 
an overall increase of 1.35 Bboe or 19 per cent from the previous year. 
PETRONAS’ total Contingent Resources (2C) stood at 15.09 Bboe, as at 1 January 2019. 
Exploration discoveries contributed 0.35 Bboe to our Contingent Resources addition in 
2018, including those from Gabon, Africa, where our 70 per cent owned ultra-deepwater 
Block 14 (Likuale) is located.
Other than exploration discoveries, we also successfully secured new exploration 
acreages in 10 high-probable locations in 2018; and increased our Prospective 
Resources (Undiscovered) by 1.34 Bboe, or 19 per cent, to 8.52 Bboe, compared with 
FY2017. 
As a whole, 2018 has been a record year for Reserves addition, and acreage and portfolio 
reloading. Whilst we sustained our operational excellence, Upstream’s overarching goal 
in the coming years is to maintain a steady stream of material discoveries for portfolio 
sustainability. As such, ensuring a strategic balance in our allocation of domestic and 
international capital investments will be imperative, moving forward.
A reflection of the healthy 
replenishment of our Proved 
and Probable Reserves (2P), we 
registered an instantaneous 2P 
Reserves Replacement Ratio (RRR) 
of +3.19 in FY2018, affirming the 
sustainability of our production 
and provide reliable value for our 
stakeholders. 
I am also pleased that we retained 
our Overall Resources (2P+ 2C) Life 
Index (ORLI) at close to 38 years, 
relative to current production 
rate, which is a testament to the 
robustness of our overall Resources 
(including Reserves) base.
The positive indicators provided 
by our key Reserves and Resources 
metrics, the RRR and ORLI, enable 
us to maintain a long-term horizon 
in monetising our resources via 
new collaborations and market 
opportunities, domestically and 
internationally.

A cost savings of RM900 million was achieved for FY2018 with 
an operational expenditure (OPEX) of RM31.6 billion, vis-à-vis 
a targeted RM32.5 billion. This was realised on the back of 
sustained productivity, better cost management, and leaner 
operations from the ongoing digitalisation of our offshore 
production processes. Management anticipates Upstream 
OPEX for FY2019 to be further reduced to RM30.4 billion 
through continued cost rationalisation to uphold PETRONAS’ 
competitiveness and resilience. 
Total equity production for the year stood at 2,361 kboe/d, 
marginally higher than our targeted 2,354 kboe/d. Amongst the 
countries where our international CAPEX for 2018 focused on 
include Canada, Argentina, Mexico, Oman, and Gabon. These are 
proven countries with abundant hydrocarbon resources.

One of our significant overseas investment is PETRONAS Energy 
Canada Ltd and its partners who own 53.8 trillion of cu ft (Tcf) 
of gas 2P reserves and 2C contingent resources (at gross basis) 
in North Montney, British Columbia – more than half of the gas 
2P reserves and 2C contingent resources in Malaysia of about 
79.6 Tcf (at gross basis). We are also optimistic of our future oil 
resources in Mexico founded on our 10 blocks in the Mexican 
Ridges and the Salinas Basin, on Mexico’s offshore. Working 
with our development and production partners, we foresee the 
first wells will be drilled in 2019 and achieve first oil in 2026 for 
conventional production. 
In line with PETRONAS’ three-pronged strategy to maximise our 
cash generators, CAPEX for our overseas assets is expected to 
rise in tandem with the anticipated growth in overseas upstream 
activities over the next five years, from our traditional 60:40 
(domestic:overseas) ratio CAPEX allocation. Nonetheless, the 
Group maintains our five-year CAPEX allocation at RM250 billion, 
consistent with our annual CAPEX budget of RM40 billion to 
RM50 billion.
Through consistent collaboration between Malaysia Petroleum Management, Petroleum 
Arrangement Contractors (PAC), and Service Providers (SP), we created a value of RM3.6 billion in 
FY2018 from our operations in Malaysia, in conjunction with CORAL 2.0 initiatives. The generated 
value was derived from a combination of cost savings, cash generation, and cost avoidance 
measures, which exceeded our yearly value optimisation target of RM3.2 billion by 12 per cent or 
RM394 million.
The biggest contributor to CORAL 2.0’s value creation in FY2018 came from cost savings, contributed 
mainly by PACs’ and SPs’ improved planning that resulted in lower drilling costs, optimised usage 
of resources, and better contract management. Cash generation initiatives, on the other hand, was 
contributed by proceeds received from additional hydrocarbon recovered as a result of PACs’ internal 
and collaborative efforts in planned deferment optimisation. 
Notably, the total value optimised since the inception of CORAL 2.0 in 2015 (including the value 
captured in FY2018) stands at RM15.1 billion. This was accomplished from the operationalisation 
of an extensive list of cost improvement measures. These measures are today adopted as standard 
'business-as-usual' practices, including cross-PAC partnership which has become the new norm in 
Upstream Malaysia.
Following the last major oil price correction in 2014, PETRONAS’ efforts in bringing the industry 
together has ensured greater industry resilience and preparedness to withstand future shocks in 
the global markets. Strategic cost streamlining initiatives have shifted our Upstream business unit 
production cost (UPC) in FY2018 to 32 per cent lower compared with 2014.
Expanding Global LNG Reach
As one of the world’s largest seller of liquefied natural gas (LNG), PETRONAS remains at the forefront 
of global LNG supply, poised to meet growing energy demand in both the Pacific and Atlantic Basins. 
Prospects for LNG remain promising with demand expected to grow in 2019 due to increasing  
pro-LNG regulatory mandate in emerging and developed countries, including Republic of Korea, 
Japan, India, China, and Germany, amidst growing emphasis on green energy. 
PETRONAS aspires to become the leading global LNG provider of choice by retaining its position as the 
world's third-largest LNG player, by continuing to secure firm commitments for LNG volumes via spot 
and term sales. To this end, PETRONAS is also embarking on vertical integration projects and  
small-scale solutions to further upscale our flexibility, such as LNG ISO tanks, to meet customer 
requirements.
The total optimised value of RM3,594 
million in FY2018 consists of:
• RM224 million from cost avoidance;
• RM2,220 million from cost savings, 
where 50% (RM 1,119 million) 
was contributed by CORAL 2.0 
initiatives; and
• RM1,150 million from cash 
generation where 12% (RM137 
million) was contributed by  
CORAL 2.0 initiatives.

Business Context
Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS)
Annual Report 2018
I am glad to report that PETRONAS successfully secured a total 
of 5.84 mtpa of LNG Sales from 10 purchasers in 2018, including 
three new buyers, namely, Switzerland-based Vitol Group, 
Republic of Korea-based SK E&S, and China National Offshore 
Oil Corporation Limited. Efforts are underway to secure more 
sales in 2019 from traditional LNG markets such as Japan, China, 
Korea, and Taiwan, as well as emerging markets in Southeast 
Asia, the Middle East, and South Asia. 
Worth mentioning, one of PETRONAS' LNG Upstream projects 
that was commissioned in 2018 – the Egypt WDDM Phase IXB 
project had successfully achieved first gas in October 2018. 
At the same time, our PFLNG Satu, the world’s first floating 
LNG facility, delivered a total of 13 cargoes during the year. 
PETRONAS’ second floating LNG facility, PFLNG Dua, is on 
schedule to achieve sailaway by Q1 2020 and commercial 
operations by Q4 2020.
Digitalisation to Fuel Growth
Leading the growing movement of digitalisation sweeping across 
the oil and gas (O&G) industry, PETRONAS accelerated its efforts 
in harnessing the power of data to sustain high productivity, 
improve effective decision-making, reduce downtime, and 
increase the effectiveness in problem-solving, especially for 
our offshore exploration, development, and production (EDP) 
activities. 
Digitalisation has enabled us to gain access to real-time insights 
and diagnostics and integrate critical information into our value 
chain, to accomplish significant and sustainable cost savings, 
especially in areas such as geological surveying, drilling, as well 
as production and supply chain monitoring. 
This is reflected in our Integrated Operations Centre – an entire 
floor dedicated to the O&G equivalent of an air-traffic control 
room – where all offshore vessels and EDP platforms are 
exhibited on a single display. The centralisation of our operations 
has optimised our processes for greater efficiency gains and 
oversight. 
Taking another bold step in the integration of big data, 
PETRONAS launched ‘Alpha LNG’ in FY2018 to reduce supply 
and offtake mismatch along the LNG value chain. This is done 
by leveraging real-time data with predictive insights on gas field 
production rates, from the gas fields, LNG plant operating rates, 
and the rate of cargo offtake.
Alpha LNG’s end-to-end centralised system allows us to make 
responsive and informed decision-making through gaining a 
full understanding of our position at the supply, storage, and 
marketing levels. The insights also helped strengthen our market 
competitiveness by minimising market and production risks in 
long-term supply arrangements, whilst improving cashflow and 
forming new supply partnerships.
The collective benefits of our digitalisation measures have 
ensured that PETRONAS maintains its impressive zero-delay 
track record of more than 10,000 cargoes delivered since 1983. 
To us, being on time and fulfilling our promise are crucial to 
maintaining our reputation, reliability, and the trust that we have 
built with our customers worldwide.
Moving Forward
In the medium-to-long-term, Upstream business will continue 
to push new frontiers by leveraging new data and technology 
towards de-risking our processes, and identifying new plays to 
replenish portfolio inventory, particularly in Sabah and Sarawak. 
Unconventional hydrocarbon will also increasingly take centre 
stage with our acquired assets in Australia, Argentina, and most 
recently, in Canada. We foresee our first shale oil project to 
be developed in the Americas in the coming years. Following 
a successful three-phase pilot project from 2015 to 2018 with 
Argentina’s state oil firm Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales 
S.A. (YPF) for La Amarga Chica (LAC) block’s appraisal, we 
successfully entered the development phase on the country’s 
Vaca Muerta shale oil fields. We envisage a daily production 
equivalent of 54,000 barrels of crude oil and gas by 2022 from 
this venture.
As part of our efforts to actively replenish our Reserves and 
Resources base, our maiden foray into Oman’s Khazzan field 
after acquiring a 10 per cent stake in December 2018, marks an 
important step in realising PETRONAS’ growth strategy in the 
upstream sector as we align our activities to ensure sustainable 
energy supply. The prolific Khazzan gas field is producing one 
billion cf/d of gas, with plans to expand production by another 
500 million cf/d by 2021. 
Governance and Disclosure (Reserves and Resources)
In August 2016, PETRONAS took a bold decision to set up 
an independent central team to implement the Reserves and 
Contingent Resources booking guidelines and governance that 
is aligned with globally recognised industry standards, guided 
by the Society of Petroleum Engineers Petroleum Resources 
Management System (SPE PRMS). After about one-and-a-half 
years of strengthening fundamentals and ensuring the rigorous 
implementation of the PETRONAS Reserves and Resources 
Management System (PRrMS), PETRONAS invited the top seven 
rated and internationally-recognised Oil and Gas Reserves 
auditors to bid for the first ever fully independent third-party 
audit of PETRONAS' end-2017 Reserves and Contingent 
Resources base and the ranges associated with subsurface 
uncertainties.
Sproule International Ltd (Sproule), a global energy consulting 
firm, based in Calgary, with a 65-year legacy of helping clients 
to evaluate and validate of their Reserves and Contingent 
Resources base, conducted an intensive independent audit 
exercise. The following is Sproule’s audit opinion:
“Based on the results of our audit, it is our opinion that 
PETRONAS’ internally generated proved, probable and 
possible crude oil, natural gas and natural gas products 
reserves, and the low, best and high crude oil, natural gas and 
natural gas products contingent resources are, in aggregate, 
reasonable, and have been prepared in accordance with the 
generally accepted oil and gas engineering and evaluation 
practices as set out in the PRrMS.”
More specifically, PETRONAS’ estimates came in within +/- 2% 
of Sproule’s estimates for “1P+1C” (Proved Reserves and Low 
estimate of Contingent Resources), “2P+2C” (Proved plus 
Probable Reserves and Best estimate of Contingent Resources), 
and “3P+3C” (Proved plus Probable plus Possible Reserves and 
High estimate of Contingent Resources). This is testament to 
the integrity and robustness of PETRONAS’ internally generated 
Reserves and Contingent Resources estimates.
As part of PRrMS governance and our journey towards full 
institutionalisation of PRrMS, we are now in the midst of a 
second independent end-2018 Reserves and Contingent 
Resources report, whereby the results are expected by Q3, 
2019.
As at end-2018, PETRONAS’ Reserves and Contingent Resources

billion for the year, 25 per cent lower compared with RM11.3 
billion recorded in 2017 due to unfavorable market conditions 
and operational challenges. Despite this, our continuous 
improvement on a quarterly basis is evident in our efforts in 
improving operational performance and efficiency.
 
Overall Downstream Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) stood at 
94.4 per cent for FY2018 across all business segments. The 
refineries in Malaysia recorded an OEE of 91.3 per cent whilst 
the refinery in South Africa recorded 95.9 per cent. Our trading 
arm also recorded an outstanding performance with the highest 
trading margin attributed by a stronger demand, focusing on 
high-value trading.
For the petrochemical business under PETRONAS Chemicals 
Group (PCG), we recorded an overall Plant Utilisation rate of 
91.9 per cent. The sustained operational performance was 
contributed by stable operations at all manufacturing plants 
despite heavy statutory turnarounds at several major plants. We 
also recorded the highest annual production volume for the year 
at 10.4 million metric tonnes with an increase in sales volume up 
to 8.4 million metric tonnes compared to 2017. This achievement 
also generated the highest PAT of RM5.1 billion since 2014. 
Petrochemical sales volume also increased by four per cent 
compared with the preceding year, backed by a steady demand 
in various segments of petrochemical products as well as  
higher-than-average product prices.
Enhancing Market Reach and Competitiveness
For the retail sector, PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad (PDB) 
recorded a 0.5 per cent increase in sales volume in FY2018, 
contributed by impactful marketing campaigns, enhanced 
customer experience and growth initiatives, as well as a 
consistent increase of fuel volume every quarter. 
Our lubricants arm under PETRONAS Lubricants International 
(PLI) recorded a modest growth in selected countries despite 
higher raw material costs, whilst our retail business in South 
Africa under the brand of ENGEN also recoded an improved fuel 
volume compared to last year. The company had successfully 
implemented the ‘Route to Market’ programme in all core high-
growth markets across the globe namely, China, India, Malaysia, 
South Africa, Italy, and Brazil. Supporting our strategic growth 
ambition, our newly-launched Global Research & Technology

HIGHLIGHTS
Strategic Growth for Business Sustainability
During the year, we also achieved significant milestones in our key growth projects which have moved at a positive pace, and 
remained on-track in meeting the target date of completion. In delivering our critical capital investment projects, we implemented 
new strategies to avoid peaking our resources, whilst ensuring that work is delivered safely, reliably and efficiently. 
In delivering world-benchmarked projects enabled by state-of-the-art technology, we have constantly pushed the boundaries of 
innovation in our project strategy, design, procurement and execution practices underscored by a value-driven approach. Strong 
attention to cost management, teamwork, collaboration as well as top-notch safety and health processes remains a core priority in 
realising PETRONAS’ project delivery excellence. 
The Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) achieved 97 per cent completion, as at December 2018 and successfully received its first 
crude oil cargo at Pengerang Deepwater Terminal 2 (PDT2) in September 2018. Crude charge-in was on target in October 2018. 
For the petrochemical business, we successfully ventured into specialty chemicals by producing the Integrated Aroma Ingredients 
Complex as well as citral, citronellol, L-menthol and HR-PIB at BASF PETRONAS Chemicals (BPC) in Gebeng, Pahang. This investment 
will position us ahead of the curve in the regional specialty chemicals market.
In 2018, the Downstream business also recorded 265 million man hours, an increase of 17 per cent 
compared with the previous year, mainly contributed by PIC. The PIC project reached its peak 
construction with more than 63,000 workers from 60 different nationalities on-site. Covering an 
area of 6.239 acres, the entirely self-sufficient complex was built at a cost of US$27 billion and is 
PETRONAS’ largest downstream investment project in history. 
The upgrading of our refinery in Melaka is also on-track with an aim to increase the production of 
Euro 5 diesel to 126,000 barrels per day by 2020, up from the current 30,000 barrels per day. We 
currently supply close to 70% of the domestic gasoline and diesel demand in Malaysia. 
The completion of this RM1.5 billion project is in line with the Malaysian Government’s announcement 
in October 2018 to implement the sale of Euro 5 gasoline and petrol in the country by 1 September 
2020 and 1 September 2025, respectively. With an improved formulation, the Euro 5 petrol will 
not only deliver better fuel savings, but also reduce the nation’s carbon footprint. The globally-
benchmarked Euro 5 fuel produced by our wholly owned subsidiary, Malaysian Refining Company 
Sdn Bhd (MRCSB) contains a sulphur content of less than 10 and incorporates PETRONAS’ proprietary 
Fluid Technology SolutionsTM which will improve engine efficiency and emissions performance. The 
same cutting-edge technology is used by our Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS Formula 1 Championship 
team, which powered the Silver Arrows to win five consecutive World Constructors’ Championships 
from 2014 - 2018.
In 2018, the Downstream business also embarked on a range of digital initiatives throughout the 
year as part of our business strategy. The journey converged multiple digital initiatives allowing us to 
successfully initiate the first building blocks towards driving full digital adoption across the business. The 
initiative aims to unlock value and business opportunities for manufacturing and operational business, 
with end-to-end visibility of plant operations status and performance.

and the potential to scale at a relatively low entry cost. At the core of our initiatives is our strategic business model that addresses 
modern day consumers’ pain points by offering on-demand services and value-added convenience.
Zero-Incident Remains As Our Benchmark
Our ‘Jom Patuh & Tegur’, or ‘Let’s Comply and Intervene’ 
campaign is key to driving a generative safety culture. Our 
campaign ranging from regular trainings, awareness programmes 
and tighter work supervisory, have directly reduced the number 
of major incidents by 50 per cent compared with 2017, despite 
higher man hours spent at our core project in PIC. However, 
despite our best efforts, we have suffered the loss of three lives 
in 2018.
A stronger safety message is being delivered across the 
organisation to reinforce our zero-incident target and we 
believe that the Health, Safety, Security and Environment of our 
workers is a collective responsibility of each and every one of us, 
irrespective of roles and ranks. This aspiration is only achievable 
with the commitment from every employee.
We will continue to be guided by PETRONAS’ Cultural Beliefs, 
leveraging the ‘See It, Own It, Solve It, Do It’ cultural model 
of accountability to embed sound safety culture across all 
geographies and work levels within the Downstream business. 
Moving Forward
Our integrated business infrastructure, expanding digital and 
technological capabilities as well as the rising capacity of our 
operations to deliver high-value differentiated products have 
provided us with the competitive advantage, so we can play  
to win.
In delivering the last mile in the oil and gas value chain via our 
extensive distribution and marketing network, we will remain 
sensitive to the market’s expectations by further strengthening 
our brand relevance and market positioning, whilst ensuring a 
sustained focus on environmental and social sustainability.
More than ever, accelerating disruptions in the marketplace calls 
for all PETRONAS employees to play and collaborate as a team 
of one, improve our pace of execution, and more importantly, 
leverage digital and technology to take us further.

Whilst fossil fuels will remain core to the global energy mix, we 
promote the use of natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) as 
a lower carbon fuel. Today, natural gas is Malaysia's largest source 
of energy, providing nearly half of the fuel required for power 
generation and a third of the industrial sector's energy needs. 
LNG also forms the backbone of Malaysia's petrochemical 
industry. To ensure a sustainable supply, we work with 
Governments to create a more competitive gas market, supported 
by ongoing gas advocacy efforts. A competitive gas market will 
also result in better prices and services for the end-user.
Paving the Way Towards a Low-Carbon Economy
PETRONAS’ resilient and integrated business model supports 
our path towards transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Over 
the years, PETRONAS has invested heavily in the development 
of new technology to maximise energy resources and reduce 
our environmental footprint, for example through carbon 
dioxide (CO2) management. Investments have also been made in 
emerging technologies through collaboration with academia and 
various parties and corporations. 
Since 2016, PETRONAS has embarked on a journey of digital 
transformation that will allow us to deliver greater value by 
leveraging advanced digital analytics and machine learning. 
We are guided by the PETRONAS Climate Change Framework 
to identify, assess, and prioritise risks pertinent to our business 
operations. Identified high-risk elements are subsequently 
integrated into the PETRONAS Enterprise Risk Management 
profile, group-wide.
TOWARDS 
SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
The transition to a low-carbon economy 
is one of the great challenges of our 
time. The Paris Agreement has set the 
global expectations for combating 
climate change. Together with other 
commitments, there is now pressure 
on countries to accelerate actions and 
initiate changes in their energy systems. 
Rising urbanisation, ageing populations, 
and a growing middle class also add to 
the evolving requirements for energy 
systems globally.
Investing in Low-Carbon Solutions
• To intensify our clean energy efforts, a New Energy unit will 
be fully operationalised by 2019. The unit develops sustainable 
revenue streams decoupled from oil and gas, with an initial 
focus on solar and wind. 
• Research and development in Carbon Capture, Utilisation and 
Storage (CCUS).
• Delivering fuel efficiency from our Fluid Technology SolutionsTM 
products (Primax, Syntium).
• PETRONAS Research collaborates with Daimler Automotive on 
green projects, such as Low-Carbon Fuel and Vehicle Emissions 
Control.
• PETRONAS supports Yayasan Sabah in the conservation of 
Imbak Canyon Conservation Area (ICCA), a Class-1 forest 
reserve.
Building Resilience
• We are integrating solar power in our daily operations. Today, 
PETRONAS has several existing solar photovoltaic (PV) projects 
with a combined capacity of about 10.7 MW in Gebeng, Pahang, 
and in Suria KLCC and a Solaris retail kiosk in Kuala Lumpur.
Driving Operational Excellence
• Zero continuous flaring and venting of hydrocarbon in the 
design of new Upstream and Downstream facilities and projects.
• Reduce continuous flaring of hydrocarbon at all existing 
Upstream and Downstream facilities.
• Malaysia Petroleum Management (MPM) to apply a country level 
CO2 emission allowance in the planning process for high CO2 
field development.
• Promoting natural gas as a low-carbon fuel.
• Energy efficiency in operations throughout our value chain.
A Thematic Sustainability Approach
We will continue to build our expertise in the sustainable production of oil and gas to provide uninterrupted 
and affordable energy supply and contribute towards a better quality of life for all. At the same time, we are 
investing in cleaner energy solutions to accelerate the energy transition towards a low-carbon economy.
The Future of Gas
We forecast that in the next few decades, demand for natural gas will grow at a much faster rate than oil or 
coal. New technologies for the efficient removal of CO2 in high-CO2 gas fields have developed rapidly in 
recent years, allowing us to venture into feasible natural gas sources. 
Although fossil fuel emissions from the consumption of natural gas are much lower than those from coal and 
oil, there are other environmental risks to consider in its production. For example, methane leakage can negate 
its GHG emissions advantages. Therefore, the key to developing a sustainable low-carbon LNG industry is to 
mitigate methane leakage associated with the production, transportation, and liquefaction of natural gas.
As an integrated and reliable global LNG player with over 35 years of experience, PETRONAS is currently the 
world’s third largest LNG supplier. Our innovative suite of LNG solutions includes break-bulking, ship-to-ship 
LNG transfers, LNG bunkering and ISO-tank solutions, amongst others.
CLIMATE CHANGE & ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
We are tackling climate change by reducing GHG emissions across our businesses and developing solutions for a low-carbon 
economy. 
• Reduced our monitored carbon footprint by 13% from 2017 and achieved a cumulative 12 million tonnes of GHG emissions reduction 
since the PETRONAS Carbon Commitments were introduced in 2012. This is largely due to strong efforts in reducing flaring and 
venting in our Upstream business, within our Malaysian and international operations. 
• Climate change strategies and long-term GHG emissions reduction roadmaps are being developed to address key climate change risks 
and opportunities.
• Established guiding principles to support businesses and effectively enhance our implementation of the PETRONAS Carbon 
Commitments.
• Stepped up growth in renewable energy initiatives and developed new energy products with lower associated GHG emissions.

CLIMATE CHANGE
In light of the world’s unprecedented growing energy demand, it is imperative that nations work together towards reducing 
their carbon footprint by lowering global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, prevent global warming of more than 2oC above 
pre-industrial times and mitigate the associated climate impacts.
The oil and gas industry have a pivotal role to play in this global shift to a decarbonised economy by leveraging innovative 
low-carbon solutions to deliver energy.
PETRONAS embraces the transition and is committed to supporting host countries in meeting their pledges to the Paris 
Agreement, as well as in harnessing potential opportunities in this new era.

PETRONAS Climate Change Position 
We duly recognise our role as a player in the global energy sector to balance the issue of climate change with the challenge to 
sustainably produce affordable and reliable energy.
We acknowledge that the emerging low-carbon economy poses potential liability, physical, and transitional risks to the business 
which will need to be managed, particularly in Malaysia where we have the greatest presence. Nevertheless, our climate-focused  
actions offer potential growth opportunities for PETRONAS to continue delivering operational excellence, technological 
developments, and the expansion of cleaner energy portfolio. 
We are committed to work towards better management of climate change risks and opportunities within the Company, whilst 
keeping abreast of the changing external landscape. Our climate actions serve to both mitigate GHG emissions and adapt our 
businesses to the potential impacts of climate change to ensure business sustainability and secure our position in the new energy 
landscape.
The PETRONAS Climate Change Framework will guide our business processes to identify, assess and prioritise risks pertinent to 
our business operations. The Framework drives our climate actions in the areas of carbon footprint, mitigation and adaptation, in 
alignment with our three-pronged strategy. Identified high-risk elements are subsequently integrated into the PETRONAS Enterprise 
Risk Management profile for group-wide implementation.
We highlight emerging legislation in relation to climate change and work closely with Group Risk Management and Group Corporate 
Strategy, as well as the Business Risk units to manage potential exposure arising from carbon liability. We partner with Group Research 
and Technology to ensure that the right technologies are developed at the right time for the right purpose.
WHAT GOVERNS US
We are focused on expanding our core business by advocating the low-carbon benefits of natural gas, as well as stepping out 
into renewables. Operationally, we aim to reduce flaring and venting, and drive energy efficiency improvements throughout our 
operations to generate revenue whilst lowering our carbon footprint.

PETRONAS Carbon Commitments 
The PETRONAS Carbon Commitments (PCC) were developed in 2012 to guide the management of our GHG emissions. PETRONAS 
is now in the midst of formulating the next set of targets, leading up to 2030, consistent with the aspirations set under the Paris 
Agreement and the United Nations’ SDGs. These commitments are key drivers to reducing GHG emissions, whilst generating value 
and building business resilience.
The PCC are applicable to all businesses and Petroleum Agreement Contractors (PACs). Upstream and Downstream businesses, 
together with Group Project Delivery and Technology (PD&T), are responsible for the incorporation of the PCC requirements in 
relevant business systems and processes, both domestically and internationally. Group HSSE monitors and reports on the progress of 
PCC implementation to the Corporate Sustainability Council (CSC) and the PETRONAS HSSE Executive Leadership Team.
The PCC were enhanced in 2017 to include requirements on managing high CO2 fields, carbon pricing, carbon offsets, and renewable 
energy. In 2018, we developed the PETRONAS Carbon Commitments Guidelines to help businesses implement the commitments 
effectively.

PETRONAS CARBON FOOTPRINT
Note:
1. Our carbon footprint is reported on an operational control basis which includes the following international assets:
a. Upstream business - Indonesia, Myanmar, Turkmenistan.
b. Downstream business - Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, China, Italy, South Africa and Spain.
2. GHG data for 2013-2017 have been restated following ongoing efforts aimed at streamlining our accounting practices with the revised PETRONAS Technical 
Standard on Greenhouse Gas Monitoring, Reporting and Verification. 
PETRONAS has revised its Technical Standard on Greenhouse 
Gas Monitoring, Reporting and Verification to align with the 
Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change. The most significant impact is the change in 
values of the Global Warming Potentials, which is reflected in our 
restated GHG performance figures this year.
 
In 2018, PETRONAS successfully reduced its carbon footprint by 
almost 13 per cent from 56.50 million tCO2e in 2017 to 49 million 
tCO2e in 2018. This is largely contributed to flaring and venting 
reduction initiatives as well as other Upstream operational 
excellence drives and Downstream improvements in plant 
efficiency and plant utilisation rates.
 
We recognise the growing level of environmental awareness, standards and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry. In 
response, we continuously work towards improving operational excellence and processes to reduce our environmental impact and 
manage our operations safely and responsibly.
PETRONAS has in place internal standards to manage air emissions, wastewater and effluents, hazardous waste, soil and groundwater, 
project environmental management and use of natural resources in our operations. We benchmark against external standards and 
guidelines such as International Finance Corporation (IFC), World Bank, and applicable local requirements to ensure the effectiveness 
of our internal standards. 
In 2018, we continued to support the Malaysian government’s initiative in promoting a self-regulation system to enhance compliance 
with environmental laws by rolling it out across the Group. We also proactively share our technical expertise with relevant authorities 
on air emissions, storage and handling of hazardous wastes/materials, environmentally hazardous substances, marine water, 
decommissioning, environmental-related crises, and project environmental management.

(million tCO2e)
However, MISC Berhad exhibited a 1.7 per cent increase in GHG 
emissions in 2018 compared with 2017, as a result of increased 
fleet activity.
Since the introduction of PETRONAS Carbon Commitments,  
we have cumulatively reduced 12 million tCO2e and monitised  
187 million standard cubic feet of gas per day over the past  
5 years. In 2018 alone, PETRONAS further reduced 1.54 million 
tCO2e and monetised an additional 37.25 million standard cubic 
feet of gas per day. This was largely attributed to PETRONAS 
domestic Upstream business which successfully reduced  
0.82 million tCO2e through three key flaring and venting 
reduction projects. The remaining 0.72 million tCO2e was 
achieved by international Upstream business through flare 
reductions in its operations.

We also focused on training programmes amongst the staff 
to increase awareness of the PETRONAS Human Rights 
Commitment and their respective responsibilities in fulfilling 
these Commitments. 
CONTRACTOR MANAGEMENT
In 2018, a total of 11 domestic contractors were assessed on 
compliance with the CoCHR. Results from these assessments 
indicated that contractors are able to comply with related 
Malaysian laws and PETRONAS’ CoCHR. Nevertheless, we 
identified areas for improvement amongst which include the 
formalisation of grievance mechanisms. Human rights were 
included as part of the mandatory HSE contractual requirement, 
contractor assurance checklist, and Supplier Tracking and 
Assessment Rating (STAR), as part of efforts to integrate human 
rights into our contractor management process. 
PETRONAS provided technical leadership and advisory services, 
as part of a working group, to develop the Human Rights Policy, 
Modern Slavery statement and the adoption of PETRONAS’ 
CoCHR for our subsidiary, MISC Berhad.
TRAINING AND CAPABILITY BUILDING
In 2018, we continued to provide in-house training to highlight 
the importance of respecting human rights and integrating 
human rights practices across our businesses. A total of  
72 sessions were conducted for more than 800 colleagues  
and 53 contractors.
Human rights is embedded as part of the mandatory module for 
‘In Service Training’ for all PETRONAS Auxiliary Police (AP). The 
training ensures our AP understand the importance of honouring 
human rights in carrying out their duties. A total of seven training 
programmes involving 210 APs were conducted in FY2018.
Moving Forward
PETRONAS is completing its assessment of all active contractors 
in Malaysia, as we continue our efforts to educate our 
contractors on human rights and how to create a safer working 
environment for all who work on our premises. Internally, we 
will continue to intensify our communications across the Group 
through training programmes to ensure the expectations and 
requirements of the PETRONAS Human Rights Commitment is 
understood and abided by.
Sponsored and showcased our Human 
Rights Commitment to promote 
public awareness during the Human 
Rights Commission of Malaysia’s 
(SUHAKAM) Human Rights Day. The 
event was attended by members of 
the public, government agencies, 
non-governmental organisations and 
representatives of the private sector. 
Presented three papers at the 
International Association for Impact 
Assessment (IAIA) Conference 
sharing our best practices on social 
performance.
Instilled human rights awareness in our 
Overseas Assignment Remuneration 
Package (OARP) programme. Over  
34 sessions were held with a total of 
200 colleagues trained.
Presented PETRONAS’ human rights 
practices at the seventh Responsible 
Business Forum, organised by 
the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) and Global 
Initiatives in Singapore.
Chaired and facilitated sessions on 
human rights management at World 
Gas Conference (WGC) organised 
by the International Gas Union (IGU) 
in Washington DC, United States of 
America.
Jointly established the Social 
Performance Asia Pacific Circle (SPAC) 
with Shell, a first for the industry. 
The SPAC is a platform where social 
performance (SP) practitioners in 
the industry exchange ideas, discuss 
common SP issues, and advance 
SP implementation in the region. 
Members of SPAC include BP, 
ExxonMobil, Woodside and Repsol. 
HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVITIES IN 2018
PETRONAS participated in multiple leadership events in FY2018 to share the company's best practices in promoting human rights 
awareness in our industry and across the globe.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
PETRONAS is committed to increase the positive impact of our presence whilst contributing to the prosperity of the local economy. 
Our business thrives in diverse societies, each with its trajectory of interests and expectations for growth. Embracing local norms, 
we work towards forming mutually beneficial partnerships to share the value we create and channel social investments that are 
consistent with the needs of local communities, as part of our corporate social responsibility (CSR). 
Our approach to creating socio-economic progress centres around empowering local communities with the right knowledge, skills, 
and capabilities. We are guided by the PETRONAS Corporate Social Investment (CSI) Framework to realise our mission statement to 
contribute towards societal well-being. In 2018, we spent slightly more than RM325 million on our corporate social responsibility.

The global

US amidst its fiscal 
stimulus

The global economy entered 
2018 on solid footing, with 
strong, synchronised growth 
in advanced and developing 
economies. The momentum, 
however, faded as the year 
progressed and the potential for 
upsides receded.
ECONOMY 
The global economy expanded 3.6 per cent as 
economic activities slowed in the second half 
of the year. A confluence of factors, mainly the 
US-China trade tension, increasingly took a toll 
on business and financial market sentiments, 
weighing on growth in the US, China, and key 
exporting countries. Growth also weakened in 
developing countries, particularly Argentina, 
Brazil, Iran, and Turkey, reflecting country-specific 
factors, tighter financial conditions, geopolitical 
tensions and higher oil import bills.
UPSTREAM
Upstream spending rose for a third year, 
spurred by improving crude prices. The 
conventional sector made up about two-thirds 
OUR MARKET 
IN 2018
LNG now accounts for about a third of gas trades in the world, 
as emerging buyers such as Bangladesh and Pakistan tap into 
LNG to meet rising demand for power.
Whilst LNG demand shrank in Japan, India recorded a significant 
growth of 21 per cent in LNG imports as economic expansion 
spurred demand for electricity and subsequently, natural gas 
burned in power plants. 
On the supply side, 2018 saw three projects achieving final 
investment decision, a pick up from one in 2017.
DOWNSTREAM
Crude oil prices exhibited greater volatility in 2018 despite an 
improvement in prices. Dated Brent averaged US$71 a barrel 
compared with US$54 in 2017, a 32 per cent increase. 
During the year, Brent fluctuated from a year-high of US$86 
in early October to end of the year at US$50 as the global oil 
market turned from being tight to oversupplied. 
Global oil demand increased by 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) 
to 99.3 million bpd in 2018 though supply grew faster than 
demand. This was despite the extension to the end of 2018 
production cuts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting 
Countries (OPEC) and its allies. 
The extension reduced commercial oil inventories in the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) countries to below the five-year average of 2.8 billion 
barrels starting in March 2018. However, towards the end of 
the year, the global oil market turned into surplus as major oil 
producers increased output following OPEC’s decision in June 
to boost supply by 1 million bpd. 
This came amidst rising concern that demand may slow 
following the US-China trade war and increased US oil 
production as well as the decision by the US to grant sanction 
waivers to eight major importers of oil from Iran in November.
Production from the US continued to grow, hitting a record of 
11.7 million bpd in November 2018 to average 10.9 million in 
2018. 
In December 2018, OPEC pledged to extend the production 
cut to June 2019. Effective January 2019, OPEC participating 
members will reduce output by 800 thousand bpd (kbpd) and 
Non-OPEC by 400 kbpd, aimed at stabilising the oil market.
PETROCHEMICALS
In the petrochemicals sector, ethylene prices in Southeast Asia 
increased by 11 per cent to US$1,186 per tonne in 2018 from 
US$1,069 per tonne in 2017, supported by strong derivatives 
demand and high naphtha prices. 
Globally, ethylene demand increased by 5.4 per cent to  
160.2 mtpa in 2018, driven by strong consumption in Asia  
Pacific, North America and the Middle East. The three regions 
accounted for 90 per cent of global ethylene demand growth. 
On the supply side, ethylene capacity increased by 4.6 per cent to 
178.3 mtpa in 2018, led by the US, China and India. Together, these 
countries accounted for 80 per cent of global capacity additions. 
The US continues to be the preferred investment location for 
petrochemical projects, with 6.4 mtpa of new capacities of 
ethylene and polyethylene brought onstream in 2018 compared 
with 6 mtpa in 2017. The new capacities accounted for half of the 
global expansion in 2018.
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT
Primary energy demand in 2018 grew 2.0 per cent, accelerating 
from 1.7 per cent a year earlier. This was led by North America, 
developing Asia and Africa, offsetting deceleration in developed 
countries. Renewables growth outpaced those of fossil fuels, 
rising 23 per cent, amidst the global expansion of large-scale 
solar and wind projects. 
The year also saw changes on the policy front for renewables 
where China halted subsidies for utility-scale solar projects 
in favour of competitive bidding and reduced feed-in-tariffs 
subsidy. The policy resulted in solar photovoltaic (PV) module 
prices dropping by more than 30 per cent by the end of the year. 
Enabled by a decline in costs, unsubsidised onshore wind and 
solar projects have become the cheapest sources of electricity 
generation in nearly all major economies.
Climate change, corporate social responsibility, falling renewable 
costs, and the drive to diversify have renewed a number of 
oil and gas companies’ interest in the new energy sector. The 
United Nations’ COP24 climate agreement in December 2018 
saw most countries agreeing on key elements to bring the 2015 
Paris Agreement back to life.
of the spending, amidst development of large 
resources in Brazil, Guyana, Mexico, and Russia.
Oil companies sanctioned projects that utilised 
existing infrastructure, allowing companies to 
keep costs compressed.
Unconventional spending grew at a faster pace 
than conventional, as companies channeled 
spending towards North American shale assets 
in their quest for faster returns.
Following the reduction in exploration spending 
in the aftermath of the 2014 oil price crash, 
upstream discoveries plunged in 2018 to the 
lowest in a decade and half.
LNG
Last year saw China’s LNG demand growing 
at more than 20 per cent, helping push global 
demand to another year of record, at more than 
320 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). China was 
the second-largest LNG importer in the world, 
behind Japan.
The Chinese government pushed for coal-to-
gas switching in its war against air pollution. As a 
result, its LNG imports surged, pushing spot LNG 
prices to above US$11 per million metric British 
thermal units (mmBtu).

The PETRONAS Digital Journey
Digital innovation allows us to combine information and 
technology to improve human and machine performance. It is 
fundamentally changing the way we work and live, upending the 
status quo and disrupting industries, compelling companies to 
rethink every aspect of their business.
 
PETRONAS is fully embracing this disruption head-on, taking 
steps on a journey to orchestrate digital transformation across 
the organisation. We simply want to entrench the digital culture 
in the way we work, as we move towards becoming a data 
driven organisation to deliver new value.
 
We recognise however, that at the core, digital is not about 
technology, but about culture and mindset. It is about taking an 
outcome-led approach and prioritising the needs of customers. 
Thus, we relentlessly seek to remove customer frictions and 
serve even the latent, unmet needs of our customers, whether 
they are internal or external.
 
Our digital journey is anchored on the purpose of solving specific 
business pain points. To ensure that we deliver maximum impact, 
each pain point is addressed through the lens of the enterprise. 
By starting small, we are able to quickly apply the lessons learnt 
in the pilot phase to improve outcomes before scaling it across 
the enterprise. 
Of utmost priority is our efforts to promote and push the desired HSSE behaviours. Backed by data, we are better able to determine 
proactive action plans, and in turn, have seen higher engagement levels with our staff. Across the integrated value chain, we are 
working to provide end-to-end visibility of key data, enabling us to be more nimble to adapt and respond to changes. We are also 
leveraging the power of machines to better retain corporate knowledge and make it conveniently accessible to less experienced staff. 
In operating our assets, we leverage analytics to push plant performance, by enabling predictive capability and consistent reporting 
from all plants.
For our front facing business, we seek to disrupt and raise the bar for a seamless customer experience. To date, we have introduced 
a mobile refueling service that delivers fuel directly to customers, and a seamless payment experience, enabling our customers to 
complete their transactions and activate the fuel pumps from the comfort of their cars. At the core, we seek to transform the way key 
functions serve the business such procurement, finance and human resource, unleashing a multiplier effect for the enterprise. 
 
All of these are a sampling of our digital efforts, as we continue to explore and innovate within and beyond our organisational 
boundaries.
 
Success is, however, measured by our ability to make fundamental changes in the way we work. We continue to learn that becoming 
a digital enterprise requires far more profound changes than merely investing in the latest digital technologies. Thus, we put great 
emphasis on enhancing digital fluency of every staff, through immersion programmes and focused outreach. As digital fluency grows, 
each person will be in a better position to adapt to the changes and opportunities presented by digital transformation. Holistically, 
teams, departments, businesses – the organisation as a whole – will be better prepared to not only adapt to changes, but to drive 
change within the organisation. 
 
Our journey has only just begun. With the resources that are available today and the accessibility of digital capabilities, there has never 
been a better time for us to re-examine our capacity for change. With digital, the opportunities are plentiful and the value potential is 
massive. It will naturally enable new dimensions for collaboration between teams, within and outside of our organisation, as guided by 
data. Ultimately, this will enable us to be bolder in pushing boundaries and scaling new heights.
We have introduced a mobile 
refueling service that delivers 
fuel directly to customers, 
and a seamless payment 
experience, enabling our 
customers to complete their 
transactions and activate the 
fuel pumps from the comfort 
of their cars. 
Anchored by business pain points, our 
digital journey is one that spans across the 
integrated value chain. Fundamentally, we 
focus on harnessing the power of data to 
enable precision in decision-making across 
our entire business.

Technology to Realise Our Three-Pronged Strategy
Our strategy-aligned Technology Focus Areas underpin the positioning of our growth in the coming decades, amidst an 
increasingly challenging operating environment. Going forward, securing marginal gains through better efficiencies, improving 
safety and environmental protection, and continuously bringing down costs through digitalisation and automation, whilst 
boosting recovery rates will remain the key themes that will determine the immediate and medium-term performance of 
global oil and gas companies.
At the same time, growing high-value and differentiated adjacencies beyond oil and gas through new technological breakthroughs 
will future-proof PETRONAS as the preferred global energy provider. The following tables map the respective technological 
capabilities and initiatives that will support the realisation of our three-pronged strategy in the coming years.

TECHNOLOGY AGENDA
Improving Productivity, Efficiency, and Cost
The optimum operations of producing assets are subject to its design lifespan. As our assets begin to mature, continuous 
technical support and maintenance are needed for them to maintain productivity and cost effectiveness. This is carried out 
through mass deployment of in-house and readily available technologies, which monitor equipment conditions and initiate 
repair when necessary.
Embedding Process Digitalisation through Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Automation and Robotic Solutions 
Going digital will be one of our key enablers to maximise value, whilst improving cost efficiency and safety at remote 
offshore locations. By converting field data into digital format and enabling 24-hour system uptime, we are able to fully 
understand field conditions and make better decisions that will raise productivity. In PETRONAS, we have undertaken 
multiple digital initiatives that will seamlessly connect systems across various fields of operations – exploration, drilling and 
production – aligned to a central location to enable high visibility and management to achieve commercial targets.
TECHNOLOGY AGENDA
Subsurface Prediction to Increase Success in Drilling
Our proprietary Geoimaging technology allows us to improve drilling success through better-designed wells, whilst 
optimising upside potentials, and de-risking exploration prospects. We registered a strong track record of discoveries with 
our Geo-Imaging Technology in 2014, achieving seven discoveries out of eight exploration attempts.
Leaner Operations through Remote, Autonomous Functions
Our future operating model, labelled Facilities of the Future (FoF), will cut our offshore brownfield operating costs by half 
come 2026 through centralised, modular and mobile-oriented capabilities. Globally, oil and gas companies are running 
leaner and meaner exploration and production operations, facilitated by technology. The future of offshore oil and gas is 
unmanned platforms, with workers moving from offshore to onshore office-based roles. PETRONAS is actively seeking ways 
to deploy digital technology in terms of data analytics, automation, and robotic solutions through our FoF programme to 
carry out surface operations, maintenance, and logistics. 
TECHNOLOGY AGENDA
Safeguarding Financial Stability and Long-term Value Creation
PETRONAS’ oil and gas portfolio currently stands at a ratio of 70:30 (gas: oil) and we are amongst the top LNG producers 
in the world. To ensure steady cashflow from our resources, our technology proposition strives to minimise the impact of 
oil price volatility through proven gas extraction technology. Efforts are also directed at growing adjacent revenue sources 
from our lubricants and Fluid Technology SolutionsTM products, which aim to deliver higher engine performance and greener 
emissions.
1. CO2 Separation Technologies – a key innovation to overcome the challenge of high CO2 content in natural gas, to 
significantly reduce CO2 concentration to meet the plant processing requirement for liquefaction of natural gas. 
TECHNOLOGY AGENDA
Unleashing Unconventional Hydrocarbon Resources
To complement our existing conventional resources, we strive to develop unconventional fields through emerging 
technologies including fracking and subsurface modelling for “smart drilling". Through this effort, PETRONAS aims to 
increase the value of our unconventional resources with lower capital outlay.
TECHNOLOGY AGENDA
Monetising Technically Challenging and Remote Resources 
Unlocking global energy resources is increasingly challenging than ever, as large conventional fields dwindle. The challenge 
lies in maximising the value of high CO2 fields, exploration, and extraction in deepwater locations, and enhancing recovery 
rates from previously depleted fields. Overcoming this challenge would extend the production lifespan of each brownfield by 
an average of three to five years.
To this end, PETRONAS has ventured into:
1. Carbon, Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) Technology – The ability to monetise high CO2 gas resources in  
an environmentally and economically feasible manner is important to ensure our production sustainability. Presently,  
40 per cent of CO2 saturation in LNG fields stands as the commercial limit with PETRONAS’ CO2 membrane 
technologies. Where applicable, PETRONAS’ Gas Sustainability Technology provides a holistic and integrated solution to 
lower the break-even costs of sour gas fields. 
2. Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) suite of technologies show significant potential in unleashing a substantial amount of 
hydrocarbons from existing oil fields economically. EOR can potentially improve oil production beyond current Recovery 
Factor (RF) of 36 to 46 per cent. The application of EOR technologies has proven to be successful in Tapis field, where oil 
production has increased from 8,000 barrel of oil per day (bopd) to 34,000 bopd.

gain and sustain market competitiveness in our lubricants segment by ensuring higher profit margins and delivering 
superior product performance through specialised additives for even better fuel efficiency, extended engine performance, 
and emissions reduction.
3. F1 Technology Fuels and Lubricants – PETRONAS aims to be the leading Fluid Technology Partner of choice for our 
customers. Fluid technology harnessing Ionic Liquid and Graphene, developed for F1 for optimum race performance, 
is transferred and applied to products for everyday passenger cars. The value-added technology creates major revenue 
impact by increasing our global lubricants market share i.e., Syntium Cooltech™. We also launched new fuel products 
with F1 technology, such as the New Primax. The technology is being developed in partnership with Daimler (Mercedes 
AMG) and PETRONAS Lubricants International (PLI). Moving forward, our fluid technology R&D will be expanded into 
emerging applications, such as: high-vacuum hydraulic fluids, gas turbine engine oil, and related green fluid technology to 
be exploited group-wide.
TECHNOLOGY AGENDA
Ensuring Mobility of End-to-end Energy Solutions 
Our robust integrated business model is defined by innovative Upstream and Downstream capabilities that strengthen our 
reputation as a reliable supply partner for our customers. Our complete value chain presence is targeted to be replicated and 
transferred to key reserve locations globally.
 
UPSTREAM: PETRONAS Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (PFLNG) facilities – PFLNG Satu and Dua – extend the limits of our 
capability to monetise stranded gas fields, whilst enabling greater logistics flexibility from field to plant. The FLNG facilities 
also facilitate the development of small and remote offshore gas fields in Malaysia, which have not been explored due to 
the high costs required to develop and extract the gas reserves. Amongst the key features of PFLNG include natural gas 
liquefaction technology, offshore floating facilities, and subsea infrastructures. PFLNG Satu is the world’s first floating LNG 
project to use the dual-row cargo containment system, which enables the LNG cryogenic storage tanks to be tolerant to 
sloshing within the ship’s hull during its journey. Both PFLNG facilities are expected to produce a combined estimated  
2.7 million tonnes of LNG per year. (PFLNG Satu – 1.2 million tonnes and PFLNG Dua – 1.5 million tonnes).
DOWNSTREAM: Please refer to pages 56 to 57 for details on our RAPID Project.
TECHNOLOGY AGENDA
Creating New Growth in Specialty Chemicals
As part of PETRONAS’ step-out growth strategy, we have embarked on the development of specialty chemicals to address 
the increasing demand for higher quality surfactants. With our breadth of capabilities in surfactant formulation, we are able to 
undertake technology development of proprietary specialty surfactants for personal care and Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR).
TECHNOLOGY AGENDA
Greening PETRONAS Premises through Renewable Energy Sources
Taking advantage of ample sunlight and the abundant surface area of our offshore platforms and petrol stations, we initiated 
‘Projek SINARAN’ where solar panels are installed at our Upstream and Downstream assets to complement our electricity 
usage. Current SINARAN Solar PV panels projected electricity generation of 24.1MWp will contribute to the reduction of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions amounting to 26,072 tonne CO2e per annum.
This is in line with one of SINARAN objectives, which is to enhance PETRONAS’ reputation as a responsible company in 
environmental management, and generate cost savings, resulting in reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
TECHNOLOGY AGENDA
RAPID: On Track for Commercial Operations in Q1 2019
As PETRONAS’ largest downstream investment in Malaysia, RAPID is part of the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC), 
designed to be a fully-integrated and self-sufficient petroleum refinery and petrochemical complex. PIC provides a seamless 
end-to-end technology ecosystem that includes refining, hydrocarbon cracking, and manufacturing end-products, such as 
basic polymer commodities and specialty chemicals.
Instilling Product Leadership and Environmental Sustainability 
To strengthen its leading-edge technology position in the global lubricants market, PETRONAS Lubricants International (PLI) 
launched its Global Research & Technology Centre in March 2018 in Turin, Italy, a major automotive industry hub in Europe. 
Our Fluid Technology SolutionsTM, namely PETRONAS PRIMAX and PETRONAS Syntium, have been the winning formula

Annual Report 2018
ECONOMY
The global economy is expected to expand 3.3 per cent in 
2019, slower than 2018 and marginally lower than the  
10-year historical average of 3.4 per cent.
Divergent trends will persist in 2019. The US economy 
growth will remain solid, underpinned by a strong labour 
market. Other key economies will experience further 
deceleration – Europe’s expansion may slow, Japan’s 
recovery will remain weak, and China will continue to 
decelerate.
Signs are pointing to increased vulnerability of the global 
economy. Threats of trade conflicts continue to remain 
elevated, with heightened political uncertainty on the back 
of a host of elections in key economies including India and 
Indonesia, as well as rising geopolitical risks in the Middle 
East and North African regions.
UPSTREAM
This year, the unconventional sector remains a key focus 
of the industry because the sector has proven its ability to 
provide investors with faster returns compared with larger 
offshore projects such as deepwater developments in 
Brazil.
However, crude price volatility may prompt oil companies 
to pull back spending, which will have repercussions on 
the industry by the next decade when discoveries fail to 
rebound.
Digitalisation and automation will be applied in a more 
pervasive manner in the upstream sector as oil companies 
embrace technology to simplify and optimise operations, 
and raise efficiency of exploration to prevent costs from 
surging when prices recover.
LNG
Australia is poised to surpass Qatar as the world’s largest 
LNG exporter in 2019, when all 10 LNG projects in Australia 
are in operation.
By the end of 2019, the US with its LNG developments 
will overtake Malaysia as the third-largest LNG exporter in 
terms of capacity.
Demand for LNG will increase because of governmental 
push to clean up the environment. Bahrain is set to be a 
new LNG importing nation, joining the ranks of Middle East 
LNG buyers, including Kuwait, Jordan, and the UAE.
THE GLOBAL MARKET 
IN 2019
THE GLOBAL MARKET 
IN 2019
China’s LNG demand may expand at a slower rate compared with 
2018 as a result of slowing economic growth. 
This year could be a busy year for the LNG market. After only three 
LNG projects with a total capacity of 21 million tonnes per annum 
(mtpa) taking final investment decision in 2018, this year could see 
more than 80 mtpa of new projects lining up for sanctioning. 
DOWNSTREAM
Oil price volatility is expected to persist in 2019. The price trajectory 
will be shaped by OPEC’s decision to curtail production growth by 
1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) effective January in the Non-OPEC 
countries, particularly the US, and global markets. 
Global oil demand is expected to grow by 1.4 million bpd in 2019 to 
100.6 million bpd, supported by sustained robust demand in the Asia 
Pacific region. 
Within OPEC, Libya and Venezuela pose supply-side risks due to the 
possibility of production falling or rising sharply amidst changes in 
the political climate. 
However, any price gains could be tempered by higher US tight oil 
production by the US.
PETROCHEMICALS
Global ethylene demand is expected to continue 
growing at a steady pace in 2019 in tandem with 
global economic growth.
Global consumption of ethylene, a major 
building block for petrochemicals, is likely to 
grow 3.7 per cent to 166.1 mtpa, driven by 
growth in Asia Pacific, North America, and the 
Middle East. 
Global capacity is expected to grow by 3.8 per 
cent to 185 mtpa. About 95 per cent of the 
growth will come from North America and Asia 
Pacific. 
The US will boost its position as the world’s key 
petrochemicals player, driven by abundant and 
competitively-priced gas feedstock. 
The country will emerge as an important 
global supplier of ethylene and polyethylene, 
with 6.5 mtpa of capacity coming onstream in 
2019, accounting for 55 per cent of new global 
capacity.
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT
Global primary energy demand is anticipated to 
increase at a slower pace of 1.5 per cent on the 
back of higher energy efficiency in the industrial, 
residential and commercial market segments. 
The rising use of fuel-saving technologies in 
vehicles will lead to marginal demand growth in 
the transport sector.
Decarbonisation efforts are underway, enabled 
by a proliferation of large-scale renewables 
auctions particularly in the Middle East, Africa, 
and Asia Pacific regions. 
Energy storage will be a core component for 
many renewables power projects, as both  
utility-scale and domestic energy storage 
solutions become more competitive. 
New digital applications are emerging across 
the electricity value chain, such as peer-to-
peer renewables power trading or paying for EV 
charging through blockchain technology. 
These innovations enable the energy sector to 
have new business and revenue models based 
on integrated data and platform analytics, with 
increased participation from traditional oil and 
gas players.

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE
The Board recognises that having an established and clearly

accountability on the other. 
Delegation of the Board’s authority to the Management is subject 
to defined limits of authority and monitoring by the Board. 
However, as the Board has the overall responsibility to manage

BOARD COMPOSITION
The successful delivery of our growth strategy depends upon attracting and retaining the right talent. This starts with having a 
high-quality Board. Balance is an important requirement for the composition of the Board, not only in terms of the number of 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors, but also in terms of expertise, diversity and backgrounds.
PETRONAS Board comprises two Executive Directors and eight Non-Executive Directors, with five Independent Non-Executive 
Directors and three Non-Independent Non-Executive Directors, whose diverse skills and experience are vital to constructive 
challenge and debate, and for the robust scrutiny of management performance and proposals.* 
Whilst traditional diversity criteria such as gender and independence are important, we also value diversity of skills, experience, 
knowledge and thinking styles. PETRONAS has in place the PETRONAS Board Selection Criteria and Guiding Principles on the 
Appointment/Re-appointment of Directors to ensure the Board is refreshed timely and with the right composition. PETRONAS 
has in the past and present, been represented by women directors on its Board.
Additionally, the Company has also established the Independent Directors’ Guidelines (Guidelines) whereby the Independent 
Directors’ Review is part of an annual exercise. The Guidelines govern amongst others, the tenure of Independent Non-
Executive Directors and the criteria for Independent Directors. Annually, the Company undertakes a two-tier assessment to 
measure the independence of the Independent Non-Executive Directors.
HOW WE EMBRACE BEST GOVERNANCE PRACTICES

DIRECTOR’S CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT AND ONBOARDING
Director’s Continuous Development
As our internal and external business landscapes change, it is important to make sure that Directors’ skills and knowledge are 
refreshed and updated regularly. To strengthen Directors’ knowledge and understanding of the Company’s businesses, Board 
meetings would include updates and briefings on specific aspects of the Company’s activities and business trends. Updates on 
corporate governance and regulatory matters are also provided at Board meetings. 
PETRONAS has developed the PETRONAS Board Excellence programme, a structured training programme for PETRONAS 
Directors group-wide. This suite of programmes aims to provide a structured development for Directors through the creation 
of platforms for insightful knowledge exchange, sharing of experiences, and harnessing skills for board effectiveness. The 
PETRONAS Board Excellence programme focuses on specific topics to elevate Directors’ knowledge and skills on the best 
practices on Board effectiveness. For 2018, PETRONAS organised four programmes attended by 60 PETRONAS Directors  
group-wide.
Site visits to plants located worldwide are also part of the Directors’ training. In 2018, the PETRONAS Board had two site visits.
HOW WE EMBRACE BEST GOVERNANCE PRACTICES
PETRONAS has in place the PETRONAS  
Non-Executive Directors Remuneration  
Guidelines and Package.
The Board is refreshed timely, and in 2018,  
PETRONAS welcomed four new Directors.
PETRONAS has established the Board Governance & Risk 
Committee since 2010, which comprises a majority of 
Independent Non-Executive Directors to review policies, 
practices, and principal risks, and oversees the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the risk assessment and risk management 
system to monitor risks in the PETRONAS Group.
PETRONAS has adopted the Framework on External Auditors 
which require the Board Audit Committee to assess and 
monitor the performances, suitability, objectivity, and 
independence of the external auditors.

THE EVALUATION PROCESS
The assessments were carried out through a combination of individual meetings with the Directors and questionnaires. 
THE KEY FINDINGS
The quantitative survey and one-on-one interviews indicate that overall, PETRONAS has a high-performing Board.
A total of four sets of questionnaires were used in conversations 
with 13 individual Directors. The following questionnaires were 
customised for the PETRONAS Directors:
i. 
Board and Board Committees Evaluation Form
ii. Director Self-Evaluation Form
iii. Individual Director Peer Review Form
iv. Individual Style Profile (ISP) Survey (online)
Key themes consistently highlighted by the Directors:
i. 
The Board is well run, with a highly respected Chairman who facilitates 
healthy discussions and encourages each Director to speak his/her mind; 
the overall interactions and tone amongst the Directors are collegial.
ii. The Directors engage in substantive debate and also challenge the 
Management in a constructive way.
iii. There is good chemistry and an emerging sense of camaraderie  
and respect amongst the Directors including in their relationship  
with the Management.
Quantitative and qualitative data from 
the interviews, questionnaires, and 
surveys were analysed and reported 
by the consultant to the Board 
Governance and Risk Committee and 
the Board respectively.
PETRONAS compares favourably 
with a basket of five world-class 
companies which adopt European 
governance codes.
CONFLICT OF INTEREST
In ensuring transparency and integrity of decision-making as well as to prevent any conflict of interest, a declaration of interest by 
Directors at the start of the meeting is fixed as an agenda item of the Board meeting. In this regard, the Directors acknowledge that 
they shall immediately disclose the nature and extent of their interest and abstain from participating in any discussion or voting on any 
proposal in which they have an interest. Such matters are recorded in the minutes of the Board meetings.
The Company also disseminates the approved disclosure forms annually to ensure the Directors update their disclosures pursuant to the 
Companies Act 2016 and the CoBE. The Company also maintains the Directors Register of Interest pursuant to the above requirements.
Apart from the above, the Directors are required to declare their interests annually, in line with the requirements on the disclosure of 
Director’s interest in the Company’s Audited Financial Statements. 
PETRONAS Directors also submit declaration of assets periodically.
HOW WE EMBRACE BEST GOVERNANCE PRACTICES

QUALIFIED AND COMPETENT COMPANY SECRETARIES
The Company has two Company Secretaries. The Company Secretaries are qualified to act as Company Secretaries pursuant to  
Section 235 of the Companies Act 2016. Both have legal qualifications and are licensed by the Companies Commission of Malaysia. 
They act as advisors to the Board, particularly with regard to the Constitution of the Company, board policies and procedures and its

The Company Secretaries ensure that discussions and deliberations at the Board and Board Committees are well documented and 
subsequently communicated to the relevant Management for appropriate actions.
The Company Secretaries constantly keep themselves abreast with regulatory changes, development in corporate governance, evolution 
of Company Secretaries role as well as business trends through continuous training.

practices in corporate governance given PETRONAS’ strong global presence and our commitment to adhere to the highest level of 
governance.

Code of Conduct and Business Ethics (CoBE)
2018 saw the continuous efforts of PETRONAS in rebranding its 
CoBE, to sport a fresh new look, yet with increased emphasis on 
integrity at work. It will continue to apply to every employee, officer 
and director of the PETRONAS Group of Companies, whilst joint 
venture companies are encouraged to adopt the CoBE. Contractors, 
agents, outsourced workers and business associates are required to 
always act consistently with applicable parts of CoBE when dealing 
with, acting on behalf or in the name of the PETRONAS Group. 
The CoBE shall continue to be the bastion, embodying principles, 
directions and broad guidance, as well as our expectations, to help 
in the exercise of best judgment, always in the best interest of 
PETRONAS. 
As a leading multinational company of choice, PETRONAS values 
loyalty, integrity, professionalism and cohesiveness, which our 
employees, officers, directors and stakeholders subscribe to. We 
have zero tolerance for unlawful or unethical activities, in all forms. 
Organisational effectiveness is central to our long-term business 
competitiveness, and our Shared Values of loyalty, integrity, 
professionalism and cohesiveness are the cornerstone of our 
business.
PETRONAS has communicated the CoBE to all employees through a 
series of training programmes, including its onboarding programme 
for new executives. For the year 2018, a total number of 6,769 
employees have undergone face-to-face training, refresher training, 
and onboarding training on the CoBE.
How we have strengthened 
this during the year
Establishment of the Legal Compliance 
Department (LCD) under Group Legal
The Corporate Governance and International 
Compliance Unit under Group Legal has been 
restructured and formalised as Legal Compliance 
Department (LCD), made effective on 1 May 2018. 
The newly organised LCD has a well-defined 
compliance structure in place and increased 
resources to promote compliance with critical laws 
that may affect the PETRONAS Group. These critical 
laws are international laws with extra-territorial 
effect that could result in high civil and criminal 
penalties and severe reputational impact to the 
enterprise, such as ethics and integrity, competition 
law, data protection, sanctions, and export controls. 
PETRONAS has also appointed a new Chief 
Compliance Officer who leads the LCD team.
Communications and Training Programmes
Various training programmes and communications 
have been conducted on the critical laws, amongst 
others 11 for Personal Data Protection, three on 
Sanctions & Export Control, three on Competition, 
and 72 on Business Ethics and Compliance.
Compliance State of Assessment Exercise
In order to understand the PETRONAS Group’s 
legal compliance priorities, LCD commenced a 
compliance state of assessment exercise focusing 
on 26 pilot OPUs/HCUs that are representative of 
PETRONAS Group’s business activities. The result of 
the compliance state of assessment for PETRONAS 
Group together with recommended next steps was 
presented and approved at Executive Leadership 
Team on 11 October 2018. These findings are 
used to develop a Legal Compliance Framework 
which will govern the implementation of the legal 
compliance controls within PETRONAS Group  
in 2019.
COMPLIANCE
“Ask The CoBE”
A helpdesk cobe@petronas.com was created to answer queries 
from employees, third parties and members of the public on matters 
related to the CoBE and to ensure better understanding of the code. 
Since its inception, the CoBE helpdesk has received and responded 
to various queries raised by employees, third parties and the public 
on issues related to the CoBE. 
ANTI-BRIBERY AND ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE PROGRAMME (ABC)
In maintaining a corrupt-free business environment within the PETRONAS Group of Companies, a high level of awareness 
amongst the employees and external stakeholders of anti-bribery and corruption risks remain pivotal.
Continuous evolution of training programmes and delivery of impactful integrity initiatives are high on the agenda, which saw 
delivery of comprehensive and structured training modules for targeted staff of PETRONAS and other employees who carry out 
integrity functions respectively. 
In educating and creating awareness on the recently amended Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act specifically 
on corporate liability, additional trainings and awareness programmes have been introduced. To complement its certification 
for the SIRIM ISO 37001 Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS), various adequate procedures are also positioned, to ensure 
PETRONAS’ readiness to combat corruption and wrongdoings effectively.
Effectiveness of the programmes are continuously assessed, including conducting the PETRONAS’ group-wide Integrity Survey 
in December 2018. 
PETRONAS’ efforts and commitment in implementing best practices and integrity in its day-to-day operations and business 
transactions are acknowledged and recognised by independent international parties. PETRONAS has been ranked as the most 
transparent company in the emerging market, under the oil, gas and energy industry category by anti-corruption watchdog 
Transparency International (TI) in its Transparency in Corporate Reporting (TRAC) Report.
PETRONAS has also obtained the International Organization for Standardization 370001 on Anti-Bribery Management System 
(ISO 37001) certification upon satisfaction of requirements with respect to anti-bribery management system for corporate 
services, covering integrity and compliance processes, procurement, registration of suppliers, investment, project management, 
and corporate hospitality management.
This certification validates PETRONAS’ strategy in implementing global best practices to combat bribery and corruption. The 
certification also evidences PETRONAS' commitment to anti-bribery and anti-corruption in a verifiable way and is a testament of 
PETRONAS’ strong commitment towards zero tolerance to bribery and corruption.
PETRONAS also participated in the Anti-Corruption Summit 2018 organised by Aram Global Sdn Bhd and Transparency 
International as the main exhibitor on 30 October 2018. The summit which saw participation from both private and public 
sectors became a conducive platform for PETRONAS and its peers to ensure anti-corruption efforts become an integral part of 
their corporate culture at all levels.
Third Parties Working with the Company
PETRONAS’ dealings with third parties must be carried out in compliance with all relevant laws and consistent with the values 
and principles of the CoBE and ABC Manual. As part of this commitment, all forms of bribery and corruption are unacceptable 
and will not be tolerated. As such, PETRONAS is resolved to ensuring its contractors, vendors and joint venture partners comply 
with the standards of behaviour set out in the CoBE and ABC Manual to ensure the highest level of integrity is observed and 
practiced. To this end, 10 Vendor Integrity Programmes that were conducted in 2017 were attended by 1,382 companies.
To further achieve this objective, we have enhanced and strengthened our third party due diligence process and controls to 
ensure our third parties including our contractors, vendors and joint venture partners meet our standards of integrity through 
amongst others, the use of know-your-customer (KYC) forms, incorporation of standard compliance clauses in contracts, online 
third party due diligence screening to assess integrity risks and compliance to critical laws when dealing with third parties. 
For employees and third parties anti-corruption fraternities, the following education and communication programmes have 
been conducted:
The CoBE documents are available on PETRONAS’ corporate website at 
https://www.petronas.com/sustainability/governance-and-ethics
72 Integrity Programmes for 5,713 employees 
27 Integrity Programmes for 1,597 PETRONAS vendors/dealers and 2,476 from other anti-corruption fraternities 
i.e. Selangor State Government, Bank Negara Malaysia, Malaysian Anti-Corruption Academy, SIRIM Berhad, PKNS, 
UiTM etc

PETRONAS WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Pursuant to its increased efforts to combat corruption and wrongdoings, PETRONAS continues to encourage disclosures to its 
secure, confidential and accessible whistleblowing channels, which are operated with the highest standards of integrity and 
accountability.
The Whistleblowing Policy applies to every employee, officer, and director of PETRONAS. Joint venture companies in which 
PETRONAS is not a controlling stakeholder and associate companies of PETRONAS are encouraged to adopt this policy whilst 
contractors, agents, outsourced workers, and business associates are required to always act consistently with applicable parts of 
the policy when dealing with, acting on behalf of or in the name of PETRONAS.
PETRONAS’ goal of building and maintaining a culture of trust and integrity means doing business the right way.
Integrity risk prevention’s strategy and plans are further rigorously managed through strategic communication, collaboration and 
engagements with internal and external stakeholders. 
The ABC Manual is available on PETRONAS’ corporate website at https://www.petronas.com/ws/sites/default/files/downloads/sustainability-pet-abc-
manual.pdf.

COMPETITION LAW COMPLIANCE PROGRAMME 
To date, there are now more than 130 systems of competition laws in the world 
and as PETRONAS continues its global expansion, Competition Law Compliance 
Programme remains as one of the focus compliance area in PETRONAS. 
The continued uncertainty of the oil price landscape has strengthened the need for 
a greater collaboration within the oil and gas players for better cost optimisation 
and sharing of risk. Under these circumstances, there is a need to focus on 
cooperation amongst competitors, in order to enjoy maximum efficiency yield from 
such collaboration, whilst avoiding non-compliance of competition laws.
Recognising the need for PETRONAS to be in full compliance with competition 
laws wherever it operates, the availability of specialist in-house competition 
law advisors ensures better awareness and foster effective competition culture 
for the PETRONAS Group of Companies operating globally, amongst others, by 
providing dedicated group-wide training. Additionally, it provides the avenue for the 
PETRONAS’ businesses to learn and seek advice with regard to complex competition 
law matters.
The PETRONAS Competition Law Guidelines have been printed into booklets for distribution to 
all employees and is also available on PETRONAS’ corporate website at https://www.petronas.
com/ws/sites/default/files/downloads/sustainability-competition-law-guidelines-r12.pdf
Continuous training and 
engagement exercise to ensure 
effective compliance programme 
across the PETRONAS Group.
In complying with its obligations 
with merger control and 
collaborative arrangements, merger 
filing approval has been a key 
feature of competition compliance, 
where approval has been obtained 
for the Refinery and Petrochemical 
Integrated Development (RAPID) 
project in five different jurisdictions 
i.e. China, Poland, Brazil, South 
Korea and Taiwan. Additionally, 
merger filing approval has been 
obtained for the LNG Canada 
project in Kitimat, British Columbia 
in two different jurisdictions i.e. 
South Korea and China.
In order to strengthen the competition compliance programme, the current 
internal compliance processes are currently being further developed and 
enhanced, including the development of competition protocols with the aim to 
ensure PETRONAS employees have a practical understanding of competition laws 
through the protocol’s dos and don’ts.
How we’ve 
strengthened this 
during the year
This year, PETRONAS was invited to speak on our human rights management on 
several platforms, namely the World Gas Conference in June and a forum on the 
United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGP) for Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) 
by the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (SUHAKAM) in August 2018. 
PETRONAS was the only Malaysian company invited to speak at the UNDP/Global 
Initiative's 7th Responsible Business Forum in October 2018 to share on our human 
rights practices. In addition, PETRONAS led the exhibition on the topic of Business 
and Human Rights at SUHAKAM’s Inaugural Annual Human Rights Day 2018 in 
December. This has placed PETRONAS amongst the leading companies within and 
outside of our industry, that is managing human rights.
Pursuant to the CoCHR which was established in 2017, assessments were 
conducted the contractors to ensure compliance to the CoCHR.
In aligning PETRONAS with the UNGP, a Grievance Mechanism was made a standard 
for projects and assets which supports the requirement under the HSE Mandatory 
Control Framework (MCF). Following the above, group-wide trainings will be 
conducted in 2019 to ensure the requirements of the standard.
Subsequently, Human Rights 
module has been embedded 
as mandatory in PETRONAS’ 
Service Auxiliary Police Training. 
HUMAN RIGHTS COMPLIANCE PROGRAMME
PETRONAS is committed to respecting internationally-recognised human rights in areas of our operations, and complying 
with our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics (CoBE), and to all relevant legal requirements. Fundamentally, the commitment 
ensures PETRONAS undertakes our business obligations whilst being mindful of stakeholders’ varying expectations. The 
obligations focus on, namely, provision of policy and guidelines, due diligence and access to remedy in the following four areas 
- labour and working conditions, responsible security, supply chain and community well-being. 
To date, elements on human rights have been enhanced into our existing system and processes. These include Code of 
PETRONAS Contractors Code of Conduct on Human Rights (CoCHR), the PETRONAS Procedures and Guidelines for Upstream 
Activities (PPGUA) and Downstream’s Operational Excellence Management System (OEMS). Additionally, in-house Social 
Performance practitioners ensure the human rights risks are managed in PETRONAS.
Moving forward, PETRONAS is looking into leveraging digital platforms to enhance our human rights due diligence.
Detailed insights on PETRONAS’ human rights practices are featured in PETRONAS’ Sustainability Report, available on our 
corporate website.

INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AND EXPORT-CONTROL COMPLIANCE PROGRAMME 
As a global integrated oil and gas company, PETRONAS is committed to adhere to the applicable economic sanctions and 
export control regulations which are consistent with international norms and standards. 
Enforcement statistics have also shown a shift of enforcement focus actions from large banks to corporations, including those 
in the energy sector. With these developments, compliance to sanctions is crucial in view of PETRONAS' global reach.
As PETRONAS ventures into new markets, compliance efforts in respect of economic sanctions and export control will remain 
pertinent and relevant. 
The PETRONAS Economic Sanctions and Export Control 
Policy and Guidelines, approved by the PETRONAS Board 
on 25 February 2016, continues to serve as a guide for 
PETRONAS businesses wherever it operates around the 
globe.
Recognising these developments, we are continuously 
improving our structure, processes and guidelines, whilst 
increasing awareness on sanctions and export control-
related issues, including through the establishment of 
the LCD as well as the compliance state assessment.
How we have strengthened this during the year.
PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMPLIANCE
PETRONAS recognises that its customers value privacy, and PETRONAS is constantly reviewing PETRONAS’ policies and procedures 
in the management of personal data.
The PETRONAS Corporate Private Policy was introduced 
to govern PETRONAS’ commitments and governance 
structure in respect of the handling, processing, and 
protection of personal data. The PETRONAS Corporate 
Privacy Policy reflects international best practices and 
was approved by the PETRONAS Board on 22 May 2018, 
and supported by the Master Guidelines regarding data 
protection.
As part of the Data Protection Compliance Programme, 
LCD has conducted 11 trainings with respect to the 
PETRONAS Corporate Privacy Policy and Master 
Guidelines to selected OPUs and HCUs in 2018. 
Trainings will continue in 2019.
Moving forward, PETRONAS expects to issue 
updated corporate policies and procedures during 
the course of 2019. These will reflect universal 
standards of behaviour and ethical conduct 
expected of each employee, director as well as third 
parties working for or on behalf of the PETRONAS 
Group and are designed to meet emerging business 
requirements and challenges. Practical guidance on 
a range of matters will also be provided to equip our 
employees and partners to exercise best judgment 
in their daily conduct.

BOARD’S ACCOUNTABILITY
The Board is responsible to oversee and ensure a sound system 
of risk management and internal control for the PETRONAS 
Group. An effective risk management framework helps the 
PETRONAS Group to achieve its optimal performance and 
profitability targets by incorporating risk information for 
better decision-making, whilst sound internal controls enable 
appropriate response to manage identified risks, thus facilitating 
effective and efficient operations as well as safeguarding 
shareholders’ investment and the PETRONAS Group’s assets.
Board Audit 
Committee (BAC)
Board Governance and 
Risk Committee (BGRC)
The BGRC was established in 2010 to assist the Board in providing, amongst others, direction, 
guidance and oversight on risk management matters. The BGRC reviews risk policies, 
strategies, principal risks and risk practices as well as oversees the adequacy of the risk 
management system to effectively monitor and manage risks in the PETRONAS Group.
The BAC assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities relating to internal controls and 
financial reporting by performing oversight functions on behalf of the Board to ensure good 
governance practices and proper conduct whilst safeguarding the PETRONAS Group’s assets.
As part of institutionalising a good corporate governance culture, PETRONAS 
Board (the Board) is pleased to provide the following statement which outlines 
the nature and scope of risk management and internal control of Petroliam 
Nasional Berhad and its subsidiaries (the PETRONAS Group) during the year 
under review. The PETRONAS Statement of Corporate Governance can be 
referred to, in pages 105 to 118 of this Annual Report. 
The Board is also cognisant that its role in providing risk oversight 
sets the tone and culture towards embedding risk management 
practices across the PETRONAS Group. 
The PETRONAS Board Charter includes risk management and 
internal control oversight as one of the main functions of the 
Board, in line with the requirements under the Companies Act 
2016.
The Board risk oversight is supported by the following committees:
RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk Management is an integral part of the PETRONAS Group’s activities. Ongoing improvement to strengthen the monitoring of 
principal risks remains a key focus of the Board towards building a successful and sustainable business. Risks across the PETRONAS 
Group are being managed on an integrated basis and evaluations of those risks are incorporated into the decision-making process. 
Dedicated risk management functions also exist within the PETRONAS Group, particularly for listed subsidiaries, to assess and evaluate 
the risk management processes for reporting to their respective Management and Board.
The PETRONAS Group has in place an ongoing process to manage principal risks affecting the achievement of its business objectives. 
This includes identifying, evaluating, managing and monitoring these risks. These processes continue to be in place for the year under 
review and up to the date of approval of this statement.

as well as effectively responding to crises.
In the event of prolonged disruption, business continuity practices shall be adopted to restore and ensure continuity of 
PETRONAS' key business activities.
The PETRONAS Group’s system of risk management and internal control seeks to manage and control risks appropriately. The system 
provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, or the occurrence of unforeseeable circumstances.
In order to build highly capable practitioners to meet risk management requirements, the PETRONAS Group provides continuous risk 
management capability development and knowledge sharing programmes.
The risk management capability development programme consists of classes and e-learning modules which were carried out to 
build the competency of risk practitioners. Corporate membership to risk associations also provided platforms for risk practitioners to 
participate in risk management conferences and seminars to keep abreast with risk management standards and best practices.
The knowledge sharing programme consists of risk publications, risk conversations, a community of practice and series of risk 
engagements, all of which propagate the sharing of current risk management practices and lessons learnt. 
Risk Policy
PETRONAS Risk Policy (refer Chart 1) stipulates the general principles and guidelines for actions which influence decisions. It gives a 
clear communication of the management’s expectations in relation to risk management practices throughout the PETRONAS Group.
The PETRONAS Risk Policy is complemented by the PETRONAS Resiliency Model that provides an integrated and holistic view of 
the overall strategy to manage the PETRONAS Group’s risks, focusing on three areas of business resilience, namely Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM), Crisis Management (CM) and Business Continuity Management (BCM). These are supported by risk frameworks 
and the relevant guidelines to govern, guide and institutionalise risk management practices across the PETRONAS Group. The status 
of risk management practices across the PETRONAS Group are monitored and reported quarterly to the RMC.
Executive Leadership 
Team (ELT)
The ELT is established to assist the President and Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in the 
management of the Company and is responsible for providing a holistic approach to all business 
development strategies as well as high impact and high value investments including mergers and 
acquisitions. The ELT reviews key risk management matters to provide guidance and direction prior 
to BGRC and Board reporting.
Risk Management 
Committee (RMC)
The RMC is formed to serve as a platform to assist the ELT, the BGRC and the Board in identifying 
principal risks and reviewing governing documents at the corporate level as well as to provide 
assurance on risk management practices across the PETRONAS Group to protect and safeguard 
PETRONAS’ interest. The RMC also promotes sound risk management practices through the sharing of 
information, best practices and lessons learnt to enhance the risk culture across the PETRONAS Group.
Group-wide implementation of risk management and internal control is supported by the following committees:

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT 
AND INTERNAL CONTROL
Enterprise Risk Management
The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) (refer Chart 2) process 
is an integral part of managing the business as it provides a 
guide to systematically identify, assess, treat, monitor and 
review risks. It aims to improve the ability to reduce the 
likelihood and/or impact of identified risks that may affect the 
achievement of business objectives.
Risk profiles established through the ERM process are 
monitored at the corporate level and across the PETRONAS 
Group and consist of identified principal risks with the 
corresponding risk mitigations and key risk indicators. This 
allows actions to be taken to ensure that risks are being 
effectively managed by respective units, endorsed by the Head 
of Department of the respective Holding Company Units (HCU), 
Business Units (BU) or Operating Units (OPU), and reported to 
their Management and Board on a quarterly basis.
PETRONAS Risk Appetite articulates the type of risks that 
the PETRONAS Group is willing to assume to guide strategic 
decisions at the corporate level in pursuit of business values 
and objectives. It reflects the PETRONAS Group’s stance, 
propensity and acceptability to take risks in various areas, 
namely strategic, financial, operational, reputational, and 
legal and regulatory compliance, and is defined by respective 
tolerances and threshold levels. At the corporate level, it is 
monitored and reported on a quarterly basis to the ELT, BGRC, 
and the Board.

Crisis Management
Crisis Management (CM) (refer Chart 3) is an integrated process that aims to prepare an organisation, at both domestic and 
international operations, to respond and manage crises in the risk areas to protect People, Environment, Asset, and Reputation 
(PEAR). 
There is a three-tiered response system which provides the demarcation of roles and responsibilities between emergency site 
management, operating unit management, corporate and internal/external response agencies and/or authorities. Testing & Exercising 
(T&E) via simulation of test scenarios validates the effectiveness of response strategies as well as promotes continual improvement as 
identified in the Crisis Management Plan (CMP). T&E programmes were carried out at the respective HCUs, BUs and OPUs.

KEY INTERNAL CONTROL
As part of the PETRONAS Resiliency Model, internal controls 
were developed to facilitate standardisation of processes and 
practices across the PETRONAS Group for focus risk areas such 
as Financial, Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE), 
Plant and Facilities, Project, Procurement, Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT), Reputation, Human Capital, 
and Country.
FINANCIAL
Limits of Authority
The Limits of Authority (LOA) defines decision-making limits 
within the PETRONAS Group, providing a balance between 
effective and quality decision-making and appropriate 
management control. 
All LOA development and revision are independently reviewed 
by the Group Financial Control Department, to ensure 
adherence and consistency with the PETRONAS Group LOA 
Framework and the PETRONAS LOA Guidelines. 
Budget Approval
Budget is an important internal control mechanism used 
by the PETRONAS Group to ensure an agreed allocation of 
resources and that the operational managers are sufficiently 
guided in making business decisions. The PETRONAS Group 
performs a comprehensive annual planning and budgeting 
exercise including the development and validation of business 
strategies for a rolling five-year period, and the establishment 
of performance indicators against which BUs and subsidiary 
companies are evaluated. 
The PETRONAS Group strategic directions were reviewed 
during the year due to changes in market conditions and 
significant business risks.
Financial Control Framework
The PETRONAS Group has a Financial Control Framework (FCF) 
with the principal objective of providing reasonable assurance 
on the quality of financial reporting. This is done through a 
structured process of ensuring the adequacy and effectiveness 
of key internal controls operating at various levels within the 
PETRONAS Group at all times.
The FCF requires amongst others, documentation of key 
controls, remediation of control gaps as well as a periodic 
testing of control operating effectiveness. On a semi-annual 
basis, each key process owner at various management levels 
is required to complete and submit a letter of assurance which 
provides confirmation of compliance to key controls for the 
areas which they are accountable for.
Corporate Financial Policy
The Corporate Financial Policy (CFP) prescribes the PETRONAS 
Group’s governing requirements in effecting the consistent 
practice of financial management, as well as to form the 
foundation upon which financial risk exposures are identified 
and strategies to manage such risks are developed. 
The financial risk management practices are implemented 
across the PETRONAS Group in accordance with the 
requirements of the CFP. This enables visibility on the 
PETRONAS Group’s key financial risk exposures for improved 
risk management.
In addition to the CFP, the PETRONAS Liquidity Risk 
Contingency Protocol (LRCP) and PETRONAS Trading Mandate 
have been established to safeguard PETRONAS Group’s liquidity 
position and its financial sustainability, as well as to ensure 
alignment of risk appetite between PETRONAS and its OPUs 
with regard to trading activities.
HEALTH, SAFETY, SECURITY AND ENVIRONMENT (HSSE)
The PETRONAS Group’s Health, Safety and Environment 
(HSE) policy is supported by the HSE Management System 
(HSEMS) as well as HSE Mandatory Control Framework (MCF) 
whilst PETRONAS Security policy is supported by the Security 
Management System (SeMS) with Minimum Mandatory Security 
Standard (M2S2) to strengthen HSSE governance within the 
PETRONAS Group. HSE MCF includes clear requirements on 
health, operational safety and environment for consistent and 
effective group-wide implementation, whilst the M2S2 outlines 
the minimum security standards required to effectively manage 
security risks and protect the PETRONAS Group’s assets.
The PETRONAS HSSE Executive Leadership Team (HSSE ELT) 
is the highest management committee that steers group-wide 
HSSE policies and strategies. HSSE ELT reviewed PETRONAS’ 
HSSE performance three times during the year. Additionally, the 
Group HSSE Leadership Team (HSSE LT) is a platform to discuss 
effective execution of key strategies and associated issues that 
impact group-wide HSSE key result areas, risk management and 
internal controls, and provide guidance on the way forward.
HSE and Security Risk Assessments were carried out to identify 
potential hazards/threats, analyse the adequacy of current HSE 
and Security measures and propose mitigations, gap closure 
activities and counter measures. HSE Tier 3 Assurance is an 
independent assessment that was carried out by Group HSSE 
to provide assurance on the effectiveness of HSE controls. 
The summary of assurance findings and corrective action 
plans were then presented half-yearly to the PETRONAS BAC 
whilst BUs and OPUs carried out HSE Assurances to assess 
compliance to regulatory requirements and HSE procedures. 
The findings from HSE and Security Risk Assessments and HSE 
Assurances were presented to HCU/BU/OPU management 
committees to provide them with a clear view of their 
respective HSE and Security risks.
PLANT AND FACILITIES
The risk management of plant and facilities in PETRONAS is 
governed by Plant and Facilities Risk Management (PFRM) 
Guideline, Reliability and Integrity Management Systems (RIMS), 
the respective Downstream and Upstream Business Operational 
Excellence Management System (OEMS), and PETRONAS 
Technical Standards (PTS). 
PFRM prescribes the principles and structured processes in 
managing operational risks in accordance with the PETRONAS 
Resiliency Model. It guides plant and facilities to systematically 
identify, assess, control, monitor and review operational risks 
to improve the ability to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of 
identified risks. The remaining governing documents prescribe 
the specific system and work processes required by the 
PETRONAS Group’s plant and facilities as part of the internal 
controls to manage their plant and facilities over the entire 
life cycle in order to operate the plant and facilities safely and 
achieve the targeted reliability, integrity, and performance. 
The risk profiles of respective plants and facilities have been 
developed through the PFRM process where risks are rated 
based on its probability and impact on the operations. These 
will determine the appropriate mitigations for every principal 
risk for actions to be taken to ensure that operational risks are 
being managed. 
In addition, plants and facilities’ self-assessment and assurance 
fieldwork activities were conducted to ensure group-wide 
plants and facilities internal controls are in place and in 
compliance with the established governing documents.
PROJECT 
Project risk management is implemented in accordance with 
the PETRONAS Project Management System (PPMS). PPMS 
Phase Gated Process is designed to retain and maximise project 
value across a project’s life cycle which includes the decision-
making process in directing and controlling investment of 
capital projects leading to project sanction. 
The purpose of the PPMS Phase Gated Process is to bring 
a measure of rational processes to the decision-making 
associated with transforming business opportunity into 
operational assets. The PPMS Phase Gated Process consists 
of structured phases from framing, feasibility study, scope 
selection, scope definition, and execution to operationalisation. 
Each phase prescribes the project management standards to 
ensure consistency of practices. 
Project risks are identified, assessed, mitigated and validated 
through assurance programmes under the PPMS framework. 
The processes are meant to reduce the risk of unexpected 
technical and/or commercial factors significantly affecting the 
project’s viability.
PROCUREMENT
Procurement management serves as a key function in 
supporting the management and is implemented based on the 
PETRONAS Tender and Contract Administrative Manual duly 
established for group-wide adoption. 
The Group Procurement Leadership Team (GP LT) provides 
stewardship on the overall strategic direction of the 
Group Procurement sector. GP LT also reviews the overall 
performance of the sector’s business proposal, progress of key 
strategic initiatives and resolve key issues of mutual concern 
and interest. 
Group Procurement has clearly defined authorisation 
procedures for awarding tenders and all procurement 
transactions covering both capital and revenue expenditure 
items.

PETRONAS Group ICT also has in place a Disaster Recovery 
Plan (DRP) for identified critical business applications. 
Scheduled drills and exercises are conducted annually to 
ensure readiness in the event of an ICT disaster.
In addition, PETRONAS Group ICT conducted a Cyber Security 
Assurance Programme (CSAP) to assess the implementation 
of information security controls of the PETRONAS Group in 
accordance with PETRONAS ICT governing documents. 
REPUTATION 
Strategic Communications Management Committee 
(SCMC) leads and manages an integrated global strategic 
communications function which ensures that a single strategic 
direction supports the business strategy. The committee 
also ensures a consistent and results-based communication 
approach and delivers operational excellence to safeguard 
PETRONAS’ reputation. 
The Reputation Risk Framework and Reputation Risk 
Guideline have been established and implemented to govern 
and institutionalise reputation risk Management across the 
PETRONAS Group.
Risks and issues impacting the PETRONAS Group’s reputation 
are monitored and communicated to the management on 
a weekly basis. Analysis from these reports is a reference 
point for the formulation of group-wide communication and 
engagement strategies which address these reputation risks 
and issues, in support of the PETRONAS Group’s business 
objectives. 
HUMAN CAPITAL 
The PETRONAS Group Human Resource Management 
(HRM) operates through a formal organisation structure with 
delineated lines of authority, responsibility, and accountability.
The Group HRM LOA, guidelines and procedures were 
established and implemented to govern and monitor Human 
Capital Management which is represented by the entire HRM 
value chain i.e. Organisation Development & Design, Strategic 
Workforce Planning, Talent Sourcing, People Development, 
Industrial Relations and Remuneration Management.
The HRM Management Committee is the main platform that 
deliberates and decides on matters related to HRM strategies, 
investments, policies, guidelines, project prioritisation and 
performance review. Matters related to HRM strategies and 
policies review and enhancement are further deliberated at the 
ELT People Development Committee (ELT PDC).

COUNTRY 
The Country Risk Management Framework (CRMF) prescribes 
the oversight structure, roles and responsibilities, and assessment 
tools in ensuring country risks are managed in a systematic and 
structured manner across the PETRONAS Group.
CRMF describes how Country Risk Management (CRM) 
oversights and functions shall be organised within the 
PETRONAS Group and defines clear roles and responsibilities at 
respective management levels. It also prescribes requirements 
on pre-entry, in-country and exit management to support 
decision-making in relation to international investments and 
managing in-country risks holistically. 
Pre-entry assessment, in-country assessment and development 
of an exit strategy for the identified countries were conducted 
and reported to the respective country’s management and Board.
KEY INTERNAL CONTROL (CONTINUED)
KEY INTERNAL CONTROL (CONTINUED)
The Board recognises that the internal audit function is an 
integral component of the governance process. PETRONAS 
Group Internal Audit (GIA) reports directly to the PETRONAS 
BAC. In addition, public listed subsidiaries within the PETRONAS 
Group have their own individual BACs. PETRONAS Group’s 
Internal Audit functions support their respective BACs by 
providing an independent and objective assurance designed to 
add value and improve the PETRONAS Group’s operations.
PETRONAS GIA’s position within the PETRONAS Group, its 
authority, responsibilities and scope of work, are defined in the 
Internal Audit Charter approved by the PETRONAS BAC. The 
Charter is aligned with the standards and principles outlined 
in the International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF) 
issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA). In performing 
audits, PETRONAS GIA refers to the internal control framework 
and guidance issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). COSO 
is an internationally recognised organisation providing 
guidance on internal control, enterprise risk management, and 
governance.
The key responsibility of the PETRONAS Internal Audit function 
is to assist the PETRONAS Group in accomplishing its goals 
by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate 
and improve the effectiveness of risk management, internal 
control, and governance processes. The Internal Audit function 
maintains its impartiality, proficiency, and due professional care 
by having its plans and reports directly under the purview of the 
respective BACs.
The respective BACs review reports on internal audits 
performed under its purview, including the agreed corrective 
actions to be undertaken by the respective HCU/BU/OPU, 
as well as the PETRONAS Group’s quarterly financial results.

Annual Report 2018
REVIEW OF STATEMENT BY EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The external auditors have reviewed this Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control pursuant to the scope set out 
in the Audit and Assurance Practice Guide (AAPG) 3, Guidance for Auditors on Engagements to Report on the Statement on 
Risk Management and Internal Control included in the Annual Report issued by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) for 
inclusion in the Annual Report of PETRONAS for the year ended 31 December 2018, and reported to the Board that nothing has 
come to their attention that cause them to believe that the statement intended to be included in the Annual Report of PETRONAS, 
in all material respects, has not been prepared in accordance with the disclosures required by paragraphs 41 and 42 of the 
Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers, or is factually inaccurate.
AAPG 3 does not require the external auditors to consider whether the Directors’ Statement on Risk Management and Internal 
Control covers all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of the PETRONAS Group’s risk 
management and internal control system, including the assessment and opinion by the Board of Directors and management 
thereon. The auditors are also not required to consider whether the processes described to deal with material internal control 
aspects of any significant problems disclosed in the Annual Report will, in fact, remedy the problems.
This statement is made in accordance with the resolution of the Board of Directors dated 28 February 2019.
AFFIRMATION BY THE BOARD
The Board has received assurance from the President and Group CEO and the Executive Vice President and Group Chief Financial 
Officer that the PETRONAS Group’s financial records are properly maintained and that the risk management and internal control 
system is operating adequately and effectively in addressing the material risks within the Group in its current business environment.
 
The Board is of the view that risk management and internal control instituted throughout the Group is sound and provides a 
reasonable level of confidence, but not absolute assurance that the PETRONAS Group is not affected by any event that cannot 
be reasonably foreseen. The Board has recognised a state claim issue which may give rise to material business impact. Measures 
have been taken including engagement with the shareholder to manage any risks that may arise from this issue. In the year 
under review, the Board is not aware of any significant control failure or weakness that would have resulted in material losses, 
contingencies or uncertainties requiring separate disclosure in the Annual Report.

OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION
Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were made out, the Directors took reasonable steps to 
ascertain that:
(i) 
the necessary actions had been taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the provisioning of doubtful debt and 
satisfied themselves that all known bad debts have been written off and adequate provision made for doubtful debts; and
(ii) 
any current assets which were unlikely to be realised, in the ordinary course of business, their values as shown in the 
accounting records of the Group and of the Company, had been written down to an amount which they might be expected 
so to realise.
At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:
(i) 
that would render the amount written off for bad debts, or the amount of the provision for doubtful debts, in the Group and 
in the Company inadequate to any substantial extent, or
(ii) 
that would render the value attributed to the current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company 
misleading, or
(iii) which have arisen which render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of 
the Company misleading or inappropriate, or
(iv) not otherwise dealt with in this report or the financial statements, that would render any amount stated in the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company misleading.
At the date of this report, there does not exist:
(i) 
any charge on the assets of the Group or of the Company that has arisen since the end of the financial year and which 
secures the liabilities of any other person, or
(ii) 
any material contingent liability in respect of the Group or of the Company that has arisen since the end of the financial 
year.
No material contingent liability or other liability, other than as disclosed in the financial statements, of any company in the Group 
has become enforceable, or is likely to become enforceable within the period of twelve months after the end of the financial 
year which, in the opinion of the Directors, will or may substantially affect the ability of the Group and the Company to meet 
their obligations as and when they fall due.
In the opinion of the Directors, the financial performance of the Group and of the Company for the financial year ended  
31 December 2018 have not been substantially affected by any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature other 
than those that have been disclosed in the financial statements, nor has any such item, transaction or event occurred in the 
interval between the end of that financial year and the date of this report. 
OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION (CONTINUED) 
In respect of the Directors or past Directors of the Company:
(i) 
the amount of fees and other benefits paid to or receivable by them from the Company or its subsidiary companies as 
remuneration for their services to the Company or its subsidiary companies; and
(ii) 
the estimated money value of any other benefits received or receivable by them otherwise than in cash from the Company 
or from any of its subsidiaries 
are disclosed in note 37.
There are no amounts paid to or receivable by any third party in respect of the services provided to the Company or any of its 
subsidiary companies by any Director or past Director of the Company.
The Company has been granted a relief order pursuant to Section 255(1) of the Companies Act 2016 relieving the Company’s 
Directors from full compliance to the requirements under Section 253(2) of the Companies Act 2016.
AUDITORS
The auditors, KPMG PLT, have indicated their willingness to accept re-appointment.

BASIS OF PREPARATION
1.1 Statement of compliance 
 
The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Malaysian Financial 
Reporting Standards (“MFRS”), International Financial Reporting Standards and the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.
 
As of 1 January 2018, the Group and the Company had adopted new MFRS, amendments to MFRS and IC Interpretation 
(collectively referred to as “pronouncements”) that have been issued by the Malaysian Accounting Standard Board 
(“MASB”) as described fully in note 42.
 
MASB has also issued new and revised pronouncements which are not yet effective for the Group and the Company 
and therefore, have not been adopted in these financial statements. These pronouncements including their impact on 
the financial statements in the period of initial application are set out in note 42. New and revised pronouncement that 
is not relevant to the operations of the Group and of the Company is also set out in note 42.
 
The financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 28 February 2019.
1.2 Basis of measurement
 
The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared on historical cost basis except that, as 
disclosed in the accounting policies below, certain items are measured at fair value.
1.3 Functional and presentation currency
 
The individual financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The Group’s and the Company’s 
financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia, which is the Company’s functional currency.
1.4 Use of estimates and judgments 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with MFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
 
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are described in 
the following notes:
(i) 
Note 3 
: Property, Plant and Equipment;
(ii) 
Note 10 
: Intangible Assets;
(iii) Note 14 
: Deferred Tax;
(iv) Note 24 
: Other Long Term Liabilities and Provisions;
(v) 
Note 26 
: Revenue; and
(vi) Note 40 
: Financial Instruments.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements 
and have been applied consistently by the Group entities, unless otherwise stated.
 
Arising from the adoption of MFRS 9 Financial Instruments and MFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, there are 
changes to the accounting policies of: 
(i) 
financial instruments;
(ii) 
revenue; and
(iii) impairment
 
as compared to those adopted in previous financial statements. The impact arising from the changes are disclosed in  
note 42. 
2.1 Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
 
Subsidiaries are entities, including structured entities, controlled by the Company. The Group controls an entity when 
it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the entity. Potential voting rights are considered when assessing control only when 
such rights are substantive. The Group considers it has de facto power over an investee when, despite not having 
the majority of voting rights, it has the current ability to direct the activities of the investee that significantly affect the 
investee’s return. 
 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group from the 
date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
 
All inter-company transactions are eliminated on consolidation and revenue and profits relate to external transactions 
only. Unrealised losses resulting from inter-company transactions are also eliminated unless cost cannot be recovered.
 
Business combination 
 
A business combination is a transaction or other event in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed are measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate 
of the fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree.  
Non-controlling interests are stated either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net 
assets at the acquisition date. 
 
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group remeasures its previously held non-controlling equity 
interest in the acquiree at fair value at the acquisition date, with any resulting gain or loss recognised in the profit or 
loss. Increase in the Group’s ownership interest in an existing subsidiary is accounted for as equity transactions with 
differences between the fair value of consideration paid and the Group’s proportionate share of net assets acquired, 
recognised directly in equity.
 
The Group measures goodwill as the excess of the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of any previously held 
interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition 
date. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
.
2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.1 Basis of consolidation (continued)
Business combinations (continued)
 
Goodwill arising from business combinations prior to 1 October 2009 is stated at the previous carrying amount less 
subsequent impairments, pursuant to the adoption of MFRS framework by the Group in the financial year ended  
31 December 2012. 
 
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issuance of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in 
connection with a business combination, are expensed as incurred.
 
Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the control of the shareholder that 
controls the Group are accounted for as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the earliest comparative 
period presented, or, if later, at the date that common control was established; for this purpose comparatives are 
restated. The assets and liabilities acquired are recognised at the carrying amounts recognised previously in the Group 
controlling shareholder’s consolidated financial statements. The components of equity of the acquired entities are 
added to the same components within Group equity and any resulting gain or loss is recognised directly in equity. 
Non-controlling interests
 
Non-controlling interests at the end of the reporting period, being the portion of the net assets of subsidiaries 
attributable to equity interests that are not owned by the Company, whether directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, 
are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity within equity, 
separately from equity attributable to the shareholders of the Company. Non-controlling interests in the results of 
the Group are presented in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as an 
allocation of the profit or loss and total comprehensive income for the year between the non-controlling interests and 
shareholders of the Company.
 
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if 
doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance. 
 
The Group treats all changes in its ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control as equity 
transactions between the Group and its non-controlling interest holders. Any difference between the Group’s share 
of net assets before and after the change, and any consideration received or paid, is adjusted to or against Group 
reserves.
Loss of control 
 
Upon loss of control of a subsidiary, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the former subsidiary, any 
non-controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the former subsidiary from the consolidated 
statement of financial position. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognised in profit or loss. If 
the Group retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that 
control is lost, except when the retained interest is a joint arrangement or associate where such interest is measured at 
its carrying amount. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee or as a fair value through other 
comprehensive income financial asset depending on the level of influence retained.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.2 Associates
 
Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence including representation on the Board of Directors, 
but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies of the investee company.
 
Associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. The consolidated 
financial statements include the Group’s share of post-acquisition profits or losses and other comprehensive income 
of the equity-accounted associates, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from 
the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
 
The Group’s share of post-acquisition reserves and retained profits less losses is added to the carrying value of the 
investment in the consolidated statement of financial position. These amounts are taken from the latest audited 
financial statements or management financial statements of the associates.
 
When the Group’s share of post-acquisition losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted associate, the carrying 
amount of that interest (including any long term investments) is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is 
discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the associate.
 
When the Group ceases to have significant influence over an associate, it is accounted for as a disposal of the entire 
interest in that associate, with the resulting gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss. Any retained interest in the 
former associate at the date when significant influence is lost is re-measured at fair value and this amount is regarded 
as the initial carrying amount of a financial asset.
 
When the Group’s interest in an associate decreases but does not result in loss of significant influence, any retained 
interest is not re-measured. Any gain or loss arising from the decrease in interest is recognised in profit or loss. Any 
gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are also reclassified proportionately to the profit 
or loss if that gain or loss would be required to be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets and 
liabilities. 
 
Unrealised profits arising from transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interests in the associates. Unrealised losses on such transactions are also eliminated partially, unless cost 
cannot be recovered.
2.3 Joint arrangements
 
Joint arrangements are arrangements of which the Group has joint control, established by contracts requiring 
unanimous consent for decisions about the activities that significantly affect the arrangements’ returns.
 
Joint arrangements are classified as either joint operation or joint venture. A joint arrangement is classified as joint 
operation when the Group or the Company has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to an 
arrangement. The Group and the Company account for each of its share of the assets, liabilities and transactions, 
including its share of those held or incurred jointly with the other investors, in relation to the joint operation. A joint 
arrangement is classified as joint venture when the Group has rights only to the net assets of the arrangement. The 
Group accounts for its interest in the joint venture using the equity method as described in note 2.2.
2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
2.4 Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
 
Freehold land and projects-in-progress are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any and are not 
depreciated. Other property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any.
 
Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets and any other costs directly 
attributable to bringing the assets to working condition for their intended use, and the costs of dismantling and 
removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. The cost of self-constructed assets also includes 
the cost of material and direct labour. For qualifying assets, borrowing costs are capitalised in accordance with the 
accounting policy on borrowing costs. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment 
is capitalised as part of that equipment.
 
When the use of a property changes from owner-occupied to investment property, the property is reclassified as 
investment property at cost.
 
When significant components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are 
accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
 
The cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount 
of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Group 
or the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced item of property, plant 
and equipment is derecognised with any corresponding gain or loss recognised in the profit or loss accordingly. The 
costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the profit or loss as incurred.
 
Depreciation for property, plant and equipment other than freehold land, oil and gas properties and projects-in-
progress, is recognised in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component 
of an item of property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment are not depreciated until the assets are 
ready for their intended use.
 
Amortisation of producing oil and gas properties is computed based on the unit of production method using total 
proved reserves for capitalised acquisition costs and total proved developed reserves for capitalised exploration and 
development costs.
 
Lease properties are depreciated over the lease term or the estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter. Leasehold land 
is depreciated over the lease term.
 
The estimated useful lives of the other property, plant and equipment are as follows:
Buildings
10 -50 years
Plant and equipment
3 - 67 years
Office equipment, furniture and fittings
5- 10 years
Computer software and hardware
5 years
Motor vehicles
3- 5 years
Vessels
20 -40 years
 
Estimates in respect of certain items of property, plant and equipment were revised during the year (refer note 3).

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.4 Property, plant and equipment and depreciation (continued)
 
The depreciable amount is determined after deducting residual value. The residual value, useful life and depreciation 
method are reviewed at each financial year end to ensure that the amount, period and method of depreciation 
are consistent with previous estimates and the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits 
embodied in the items of property, plant and equipment.
 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are 
expected from its use or disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the net carrying 
amount is recognised in the profit or loss.
2.5 Investment properties
 
Investment properties are properties which are owned either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for 
both. Properties that are occupied by the companies in the Group are accounted for as owner-occupied rather than 
as investment properties. 
 
Freehold land and projects-in-progress are stated at cost and are not depreciated. Other investment properties are 
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any, consistent with the accounting 
policy for property, plant and equipment as stated in note 2.4.
 
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property. The cost of self-
constructed investment property includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable 
to bringing the investment property to a working condition for its intended use and capitalised borrowing costs. 
 
Depreciation is recognised in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging between 
10 and 50 years for buildings.
 
An investment property is derecognised on its disposal, or when it is permanently withdrawn from use and no future 
economic benefits are expected from its disposal. The difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount is recognised in the profit or loss in the period in which the item is derecognised.
2.6 Land held for development
 
 
Land held for development consists of land or such portions thereof on which no development activities have been 
carried out or where development activities are not expected to be completed within the normal operating cycle. Such 
land is classified as non-current asset and is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value consistent with the 
accounting policy for inventories as stated in note 2.16.
 
Cost includes acquisition cost of land and attributable development expenditure. Cost associated with the acquisition 
of land includes the purchase price of the land, professional fees, stamp duties, commissions, conversion fees and 
other relevant levies. Development expenditure includes the cost for development of main infrastructure works.
 
Land held for development is reclassified as properties under development at the point when development activities 
have commenced and where it can be demonstrated that the development activities can be completed within the 
normal operating cycle. Properties under development are, in turn, reclassified as developed properties held for sale 
upon completion of the development activities.
 
Properties under development and developed properties held for sale are recognised as trade and other inventories in 
current assets. The accounting policy is described separately in note 2.16.
2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
2.7 Leased assets
 
A lease arrangement is accounted for as finance or operating lease in accordance with the accounting policy as 
stated below. When the fulfilment of an arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset and the arrangement 
conveys a right to use the asset, it is accounted for as a lease in accordance with the accounting policy below although 
the arrangement does not take the legal form of a lease.
 
Finance lease
 
A lease is recognised as a finance lease if it transfers substantially to the Group and the Company all the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership. Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the 
lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the 
asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. The corresponding liability is 
included in the statement of financial position as non-current liabilities.
 
Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance costs and the reduction of 
the outstanding liability. Finance costs, which represent the difference between the total leasing commitments and the 
fair value of the assets acquired, are recognised in the profit or loss and allocated over the lease term so as to produce 
a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each accounting period. 
 
Contingent lease payments, if any, are accounted for by revising the minimum lease payments over the remaining 
term of the lease when the lease adjustment is confirmed.
 
Leasehold land which in substance is a finance lease is classified as property, plant and equipment, or as investment 
property if held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both. 
 
Operating lease
 
All leases that do not transfer substantially to the Group and the Company all the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership are classified as operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognised on the Group’s and the 
Company’s statements of financial position. 
 
Payments made under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on 
a straight-line basis. Contingent rentals are charged to profit or loss in the reporting period in which they are incurred.
 
Leasehold land which in substance is an operating lease is classified as prepaid lease payments.
 
Prepaid lease payments
 
 
Prepaid rental and leasehold land which in substance is an operating lease are classified as prepaid lease payments. 
The payments made on entering into a lease arrangement or acquiring a leasehold land are accounted for as prepaid 
lease payments that are amortised over the lease term in accordance with the pattern of benefits provided.

2.8 Investments
 
Long term investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are stated at cost less impairment loss, if any, 
in the Company’s financial statements unless the investment is classified as held for sale or distribution. The cost of 
investments includes transaction costs.
 
The carrying amount of these investments includes fair value adjustments on shareholder’s loans and advances, if any 
(note 2.12(i)).
2.9 Intangible assets
 
Goodwill 
 
Goodwill arising from business combinations is initially measured at cost as described in note 2.1. Following the initial 
recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised but 
instead, it is reviewed for impairment, annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may be impaired. 
 
In respect of equity-accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment. The entire carrying amount of the investment is reviewed for impairment when there is objective evidence 
of impairment.
 
Exploration expenditure
 
Intangible assets also include expenditure on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources 
(hereinafter collectively referred to as “exploration expenditure”). The accounting policy for exploration expenditure is 
described separately in note 2.10.
 
Other intangible assets
 
Intangible assets other than goodwill and exploration expenditure are measured on initial recognition at cost. The 
costs of intangible assets acquired in a business combination are their fair values as at the date of acquisition. 
 
 
Following initial recognition, intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and any accumulated impairment losses.
 
Amortisation for intangible assets with finite useful lives is recognised in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over 
the estimated economic useful lives. Certain recoverable expenditure incurred under a service contract is amortised 
based on unit of production method, which is calculated based on the entitlement of production for the period, over 
the entitlement of production for the period and estimated entitlement for the remaining life of the asset. 
 
The amortisation method and the useful life for intangible assets are reviewed at least at each reporting date. Intangible 
assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible assets may be impaired. 
 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. These intangible 
assets are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may be impaired.
2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
2.10 Exploration and development expenditure
 
The Group follows the successful efforts method of accounting for the exploration and development expenditure. 
 
Exploration expenditure
 
Costs directly associated with an exploration well, including license acquisition, costs of acquiring undeveloped land 
and drilling costs, are initially capitalised as intangible assets until the results have been evaluated. 
 
If a well does not result in successful discovery of economically recoverable volume of hydrocarbons or the costs of 
undeveloped land that expires, such costs are impaired or written off. If hydrocarbons are found and, subject to further 
appraisal activity which may include the drilling of further wells, are likely to be capable of commercial development 
under prevailing economic conditions, the costs continue to be carried as intangible assets. Such costs are reviewed 
at least once a year to determine whether the reserves found or appraised remain economically viable. When this is no 
longer the case, the costs are impaired or written off.
 
Where development plan is commercially viable and approved by the relevant authorities, the related exploration and 
evaluation costs are transferred to projects-in-progress in property, plant and equipment.
 
Development expenditure
 
Development expenditure comprises all costs incurred in bringing a field to commercial production and is capitalised 
as incurred. The amount capitalised includes attributable interests and other financing costs incurred on exploration 
and development before commencement of production.
 
Upon commencement of production, the exploration and development expenditure initially capitalised as projects-
in-progress are transferred to oil and gas properties, and are depreciated as described in the accounting policy for 
property, plant and equipment (note 2.4).
2.11 Non-current assets held for sale
 
Non-current assets and disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered primarily 
through sale rather than through continuing use, are classified as held for sale. This condition is regarded as met only 
when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
 
Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets (or all the assets and liabilities in a disposal group) are 
remeasured in accordance with the Group’s applicable accounting policies. Thereafter, on initial classification as held 
for sale, the assets or disposal groups are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Any 
differences are charged to the profit or loss.
 
Intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investment properties once classified as held for sale are not 
amortised nor depreciated. In addition, equity accounting of equity-accounted investees ceases once classified as 
held for sale.

2.12 Financial instruments
 
Unless specifically disclosed below, the Group and the Company generally applied the following accounting policies 
retrospectively. Nevertheless, as permitted by MFRS 9 Financial Instruments, the Group and the Company have elected 
not to restate the comparatives.
 
Recognition and initial measurement
 
A financial instrument is recognised in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group or the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
 
Current financial year
 
A financial asset (unless it is a receivable without a significant financing component) and a financial liability is measured 
at fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial instrument not at fair value through profit or loss, any directly 
attributable transaction cost incurred at the acquisition or issuance of the financial instrument. A receivable that does 
not contain a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. 
 
No change to the accounting policy in relation to regular way purchases or sales (purchases or sales under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of financial assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the 
marketplace concerned) and fair value adjustments on shareholder’s loans and advances. 
 
Previous financial year
 
Financial instruments were recognised initially, at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial instrument not 
at fair value through profit or loss, any directly attributable transactions incurred at the acquisition or issuance of the 
financial instrument.
 
Regular way purchases or sales were recognised on the trade date i.e. the date that the Group and the Company 
commit to purchase or sell the financial asset. 
 
Fair value adjustments on shareholder’s loans and advances at initial recognition, if any, were added to the carrying 
value of investments in the Company’s financial statements.
 
Classification and subsequent measurement
(i) 
Financial assets
 
Current financial year
 
Upon adoption of MFRS 9 Financial Instruments, financial assets are classified as measured at amortised cost, 
fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”) and fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”), as 
appropriate. 
 
The Group and the Company determine the classification of financial assets at initial recognition and are not 
reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing 
financial assets in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting 
period following the change in the business model.
2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.12 Financial instruments (continued)
 
Classification and subsequent measurement (continued)
(i) 
Financial assets (continued)
 
Current financial year (continued) 
(a) 
Amortised cost
 
Amortised cost category comprises financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is 
to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The financial 
assets are not designated as at fair value through profit or loss. Subsequent to initial recognition, these 
financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method (note 2.12 (vi)). Interest 
income and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.
(b) Fair value through other comprehensive income
 
This category comprises debt instruments where it is held within a business model whose objective is 
achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and its contractual terms 
give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding. The debt instruments are not designated as at fair value through profit or loss.
 
Fair value through other comprehensive income category also comprises investment in equity that are 
not held for trading, and the Group and the Company irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in 
the investment’s fair value in other comprehensive income. This election is made on an investment-by-
investment basis. 
 
Financial assets categorised as fair value through other comprehensive income are subsequently measured 
at fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised directly in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated under fair value through other comprehensive income reserve in equity. For debt instruments, 
when the investment is derecognised or determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recorded in equity is reclassified to the profit or loss. For equity instruments, the gains or losses are never 
reclassified to profit or loss.
(c) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
 
All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive 
income as described above are measured at fair value through profit or loss. This includes derivative financial 
assets (except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging 
instrument as per note 2.12(iii) and (iv)). On initial recognition, the Group and the Company may irrevocably 
designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at fair 
value through other comprehensive income as at fair value through profit or loss if doing so eliminates or 
significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. 
 
Financial assets categorised as fair value through profit or loss are subsequently measured at their fair value 
with gains or losses recognised in the profit or loss. The methods used to measure fair value are stated in 
note 2.25.

Previous financial year
 
In the previous financial year, financial assets of the Group and of the Company were classified and measured 
under MFRS 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement as follows:
(a) 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
 
Fair value through profit or loss category comprised financial assets that were held for trading, including 
derivatives (except for a derivative that was a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective 
hedging instrument), contingent consideration in a business combination and financial assets that were 
specifically designated into this category upon initial recognition.
 
Financial assets categorised as fair value through profit or loss were subsequently measured at their fair value 
with gains or losses recognised in the profit or loss. The methods used to measure fair value are stated in 
note 2.25.
(b) Loans and receivables
 
Loans and receivables category comprised debt instruments that were not quoted in an active market. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets categorised as loans and receivables were measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method (note 2.12(vi)).
(c) Held-to-maturity 
 
The Group and the Company did not have any held-to-maturity investment as at 31 December 2017.
(d) Available-for-sale financial assets
 
Available-for-sale category comprised investment in equity and debt securities instruments that were not 
held for trading. 
 
Investments in equity instruments that did not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair 
value cannot be reliably measured were measured at cost. Other financial assets categorised as available-
for-sale were subsequently measured at fair value with unrealised gains or losses recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated under available-for-sale reserve in equity until the investment was 
derecognised or determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recorded 
in equity was reclassified to the profit or loss.

category upon initial recognition. 
 
Financial liabilities categorised as fair value through profit or loss are subsequently measured at their fair 
value with gains or losses recognised in the profit or loss. 
(b) Amortised cost
 
Subsequent to initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method (see note 2.12(vi)).
 
Gains and losses are recognised in the profit or loss through the amortisation process as well as when the 
liabilities are derecognised.

Gains and losses were recognised in the profit or loss when the liabilities were derecognised as well as 
through the amortisation process.
(iii) Financial guarantee contracts
 
A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the 
holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the 
terms of a debt instrument. 
 
Current financial year
Financial guarantees issued are initially measured at fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at higher of:
• 
the amount of the loss allowance; and
• 
the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in 
accordance to the principles of MFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
Liabilities arising from financial guarantees are presented together with other provisions.
 
Previous financial year
 
Financial guarantee contracts were recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that 
were directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Financial guarantee contracts were amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the contractual period of the debt instrument. Where the guarantee did not have a specific 
period, the guarantee would only be recognised in the profit or loss upon discharge of the guarantee.
 
When settlement of a financial guarantee contract became probable, an estimate of the obligation was made. 
If the carrying value of the financial guarantee contract was lower than the obligation, the carrying value was 
adjusted to the obligation amount and accounted for as a provision.

Classification and subsequent measurement (continued)
(iv) Derivative financial instruments
 
The Group and the Company use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate and foreign currency swaps, 
forward rate contracts, futures and options, to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency 
exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. 
 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is 
entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the 
fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year are recognised in the profit or 
loss.
 
In general, contracts to sell or purchase non-financial items to meet expected own use requirements are not 
accounted for as financial instruments. However, contracts to sell or purchase commodities that can be net settled 
or which contain written options are required to be recognised at fair value, with gains and losses recognised in 
the profit or loss.
 
Current financial year
 
An embedded derivative is recognised separately from the host contract where the host contract is not a 
financial asset, and accounted for separately if, and only if, the derivative is not closely related to the economic 
characteristics and risks of the host contract and the host contract is not measured at fair value through profit 
or loss. The host contract, in the event an embedded derivative is recognised separately, is accounted for in 
accordance with policy applicable to the nature of the host contract.
 
Previous financial year
 
An embedded derivative was recognised separately from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative if, 
and only if, it was not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the host 
contract was not categorised at fair value through profit or loss. The host contract, in the event an embedded 
derivative was recognised separately, was accounted for in accordance with policy applicable to the nature of the 
host contract. 
(v) 
Offsetting of financial instruments
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial 
position if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an 
intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.12 Financial instruments (continued)
 
Classification and subsequent measurement (continued)
(vi) Amortised cost of financial instruments
 
Current financial year
 
Interest income is recognised by applying effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount except for credit 
impaired financial assets (see note 2.13 (i)) where effective interest rate is applied to the amortised cost. 
 
Previous financial year
 
Amortised cost was computed using the effective interest method. This method used effective interest rate that 
exactly discounted estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial instrument 
to the net carrying amount of the financial instrument. Amortised cost took into account any transaction costs 
and any discount or premium on settlement.
(vii) Derecognition of financial instruments
 
A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or, the Group 
and the Company have transferred their rights to receive cash flows from the asset or have assumed an obligation 
to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a “pass-through” arrangement 
without retaining control of the asset or substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset.
 
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of the consideration 
received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that 
had been recognised in equity is recognised in the profit or loss, except for equity investments at fair value 
through other comprehensive income where the gain or loss are recognised in other comprehensive income.
 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expired. 
On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liabilities 
extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred 
or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the profit or loss.
2.13 Impairment
(i) 
Financial assets, contract assets and finance lease receivables
 
Unless specifically disclosed below, the Group and the Company generally applied the following accounting 
policies retrospectively. Nevertheless, as permitted by MFRS 9 Financial Instruments, the Group and the Company 
have elected not to restate the comparatives.
 
Current financial year 
 
The Group and the Company recognise loss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets measured 
at amortised cost, debt investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, contract assets 
and finance lease receivables. 
2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.13 Impairment (continued)
(i) 
Financial assets, contract assets and finance lease receivables (continued)
 
Current financial year (continued)
 
The Group and the Company measure loss allowances on debt securities, receivables and contract assets at an 
amount equal to lifetime expected credit loss. For debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the 
reporting date, other debt securities for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition 
and finance lease receivables, the loss allowances are measured as 12 months expected credit losses.
 
Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the 
expected life of a financial instrument, while 12 months expected credit losses are the portion of expected credit 
losses that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. 
 
When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition 
and when estimating expected credit loss, the Group and the Company consider reasonable and supportable 
information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and 
qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment 
and including forward-looking information, where available. 
 
The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is past due.
 
The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations 
to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security. 
 
The maximum period considered when estimating expected credit losses is the maximum contractual period 
over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.
 
An impairment loss in respect of financial assets measured at amortised cost is recognised in profit or loss and the 
carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account. 
 
An impairment loss in respect of debt investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
is recognised in profit or loss and the allowance account is recognised in other comprehensive income.
 
Previous financial year
 
All financial assets (except for financial assets categorised as fair value through profit or loss, investments in 
subsidiaries, investments in associates and investments in joint ventures) were assessed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there was any objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events having an 
impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset. Losses expected as a result of future events, no matter 
how likely, were not recognised. For an investment in an equity instrument, a significant or prolonged decline in 
the fair value below its cost was an objective evidence of impairment. If any such objective evidence exists, then 
the financial asset’s recoverable amount was estimated.
 
An impairment loss in respect of loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments was recognised in 
profit or loss and was measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the 
asset was reduced through the use of an allowance account.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.13 Impairment (continued)
(i) 
Financial assets, contract assets and finance lease receivables (continued)
 
Previous financial year (continued)
 
An impairment loss in respect of available-for-sale financial assets was recognised in profit or loss and was 
measured as the difference between the asset’s acquisition cost (net of any principal repayment and amortisation) 
and the asset’s current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised. Where a decline in the fair value 
of an available-for-sale financial asset had been recognised in other comprehensive income, the cumulative loss 
in other comprehensive income was reclassified from equity to profit or loss.
 
An impairment loss in respect of unquoted equity instrument that was carried at cost was recognised in profit or 
loss and was measured as the difference between the financial asset’s carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.
 
Impairment losses recognised in profit or loss for an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-
sale were not reversed through profit or loss.
 
If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument increased and the increase can be objectively related 
to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss was reversed, 
to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount did not exceed what the carrying amount would have been had 
the impairment not been recognised at the date the impairment was reversed. The amount of the reversal was 
recognised in profit or loss.
(ii) 
Other assets
 
The carrying amounts of other assets, other than inventories, deferred tax assets and non-current assets or 
disposal groups classified as held for sale, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. 
 
If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised if the 
carrying amount of an asset or the cash-generating unit to which it belongs exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss.
 
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows from continuing use 
that are largely independent from other assets and groups. An impairment loss recognised in respect of a cash-
generating unit is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to 
reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
 
The recoverable amount is the greater of the asset’s fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. In assessing 
value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an 
asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the 
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.13 Impairment (continued)
(ii) 
Other assets (continued)
 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. In respect of other assets, 
impairment losses are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had 
been recognised.
 
Reversals of impairment losses are credited to the profit or loss in the year in which the reversals are recognised. 
2.14 Cash and cash equivalents
 
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and bank balances, deposits with licensed financial institutions and 
highly liquid investments which have an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of the statements of 
cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are presented net of bank overdrafts and deposits restricted, if any.
2.15 Contract assets and contract liabilities
Current financial year – contract assets and contract liabilities
 
Contract assets represent the Group’s and the Company’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that 
the entity has transferred to a customer when that right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. 
Contract assets are subject to impairment in accordance to MFRS 9 Financial Instruments (see note 2.13(i)).
 
Contract liabilities represent the Group’s and the Company’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for 
which the Group and the Company have received consideration, or the amount is due with unconditional right, from 
the customer.
Previous financial year – construction work-in-progress
 
Construction work-in-progress represented the gross unbilled amount expected to be collected from customers for 
contract work performed to date. It was measured at cost plus profit recognised to date less progress billings and 
recognised losses. Cost included all expenditure related directly to specific projects and an allocation of fixed and 
variable overheads incurred in the Group’s contract activities based on normal operating capacity. 
 
Construction work-in-progress was presented as part of trade and other receivables as amount due from contract 
customers in the statement of financial position for all contracts in which costs incurred plus recognised profits 
exceed progress billings. If progress billings exceeded costs incurred plus recognised profits, then the difference was 
presented as amount due to contract customers which was part of trade and other payables in the statement of 
financial position.

2.16 Inventories 
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in 
the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the 
sale.
 
Cost of crude oil and condensates includes costs of bringing the inventories to their present location and condition, 
and is determined on a weighted average basis. 
 
Cost of petroleum products includes crude oil costs, export duty, transportation charges and processing costs, and is 
determined on a weighted average basis. 
 
Cost of liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and petrochemical products includes raw gas costs and production overheads, 
and is determined on a weighted average basis.
 
Cost of material stores and spares consists of the invoiced value from suppliers and import duty charges, and is 
determined on a weighted average basis.
 
Cost of developed properties held for sale and properties under development consists of costs associated with 
the acquisition of land, all costs that are directly attributable to development activities, appropriate proportions of 
common costs attributable to developing the properties, and interest expenses incurred during the period of active 
development.
 
Lifting of offtake arrangements for crude oil and condensate produced in joint arrangements are such that it is not 
practicable for each participant to receive or sell its precise share of the overall production during the period. At each 
reporting date, the extent of underlift is recognised as an asset at the lower of the cost and net realisable value, while 
overlift is recognised as a liability. The net movement in underlift and overlift is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
2.17 Provisions
 
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group and the Company have a present legal or constructive 
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future net cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting 
is used, the accretion in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as finance cost. 
 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the net expenditure required to settle the present 
obligation at the reporting date. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best 
estimate.
 
Possible obligations whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
future events not wholly within the control of the Group, are not recognised in the financial statements but are 
disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote.
 
In particular, information about provisions that have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the 
financial statements is described in note 24.
2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.18 Employee benefits 
Short term benefits
 
Wages and salaries, bonuses and social security contributions are recognised as an expense in the year in which the 
associated services are rendered by employees of the Group and the Company.
Defined contribution plans
 
As required by law, companies in Malaysia make contributions to the state pension scheme, the Employees Provident 
Fund (“EPF”). 
 
Some of the Group’s foreign subsidiaries make contributions to their respective countries’ statutory pension schemes 
and certain other independently-administered funds which are defined contribution plans. 
 
Such contributions are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss as incurred.
2.19 Taxation
 
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the profit or loss 
except to the extent it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax
 
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using the statutory tax rates at the 
reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax
 
Deferred tax is provided for, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the reporting date between the 
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. In principle, deferred tax 
liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences, unabsorbed capital allowances, unused reinvestment allowances, unused investment tax 
allowances, unused tax losses and other unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will 
be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unabsorbed capital allowances, unused reinvestment 
allowances, unused investment tax allowances, unused tax losses and other unused tax credits can be utilised.
 
Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill and the 
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and that affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
 
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting 
period.
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and 
assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax 
entities where they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will 
be realised simultaneously.

future taxable profit will be available against which the related tax benefit can be realised.
 
2.20 Foreign currency transactions
 
In preparing the financial statements of individual entities in the Group, transactions in currencies other than the 
entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are translated to the functional currencies at rates of exchange ruling 
on the transaction dates. 
 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date have been retranslated to the 
functional currency at rates ruling on the reporting date.
 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which are measured at fair value, are retranslated 
to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-
monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currency are not retranslated. 
 
Gains and losses on exchange arising from retranslation are recognised in the profit or loss, except for differences 
arising on retranslation of equity instruments at FVOCI which are recognised in equity and are never reclassified to 
profit or loss.
 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than Ringgit Malaysia, are 
translated into Ringgit Malaysia at the exchange rates ruling at reporting date, except for goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising from business combinations before 1 April 2011 which are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
acquirer company pursuant to the adoption of MFRS framework. 
 
The income and expenses are translated at the exchange rates at the date of the transactions or at an average rate 
that approximates those rates. All resulting exchange differences are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve 
within equity.
 
In the consolidated financial statements, when settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to the 
Group’s foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses 
arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of the net investment in a foreign operation and are 
reclassified to other comprehensive income and accumulated under foreign currency translation reserve in equity. 
Upon disposal of the investment, the cumulative exchange differences previously recorded in equity are reclassified to 
the consolidated profit or loss.
2.21 Borrowing costs and foreign currency exchange differences relating to projects-in-progress
 
Borrowing costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, 
which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to be prepared for their intended use or sale, are 
capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
 
The capitalisation of borrowing costs as part of the cost of a qualifying asset commences when expenditure for the 
asset is being incurred, borrowing costs are being incurred and activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its 
intended use or sale are in progress. Capitalisation of borrowing costs ceases when all activities necessary to prepare 
the qualifying asset for its intended use or sale are completed.
2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.21 Borrowing costs and foreign currency exchange differences relating to projects-in-progress (continued)
 
The capitalisation rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation is the weighted 
average of the borrowing costs applicable to borrowings that are outstanding during the year, other than borrowings 
made specifically for the purpose of financing a specific qualifying asset, in which case the actual borrowing cost 
incurred on that borrowing less any investment income on the temporary investment of that borrowings, will be 
capitalised.
 
Exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings, although regarded as an adjustment to borrowing 
costs, are not capitalised but instead recognised in the profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
2.22 Revenue
Current financial year
 
Revenue from contract with customers is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer 
and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group or the Company recognises revenue when or 
as it transfers control over a product or service to customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains 
control of the asset.
 
An entity transfers control of a good or service over time and, therefore, satisfies a performance obligation and 
recognises revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:
(i) 
the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance as the 
entity performs; or
(ii) 
the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work-in-progress) that the customer controls 
as the asset is created or enhanced; or
(iii) the entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an 
enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
 
If a performance obligation is not satisfied over time in accordance with the above criteria, an entity satisfies the 
performance obligation and recognises revenue at a point in time.
 
Revenue arising from shipping activities is mainly from freight income and charter income. Freight income and the 
relevant discharged costs of cargoes loaded onto vessels up to the reporting date are accrued for in the profit or loss 
based on percentage of completion method. Charter income is accrued on time accrual basis.
 
Revenue arising from rental income of investment properties is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
lease under the lease arrangement (see note 34).
 
Revenue arising from gas trading activities, where forward and future sale and purchase contracts for gas have been 
determined to be for trading purposes, the associated sales and purchases are reported net within sales.
 
Revenue arising from investments yielding dividend is recognised when the shareholders’ right to receive payment is 
established.
 
Revenue arising from assets yielding interest is recognised on a time proportion basis that takes into account the 
effective yield on the assets.

Previous financial year
 
Revenue from sale of oil and gas and their related products was recognised in the profit or loss when the risks and 
rewards of ownership had been transferred to the buyer.
 
Revenue from services rendered was recognised in the profit or loss based on actual and estimates of work done in 
respect of services rendered for long term project management contracts. Work done was measured based on internal 
certification of project activities. Full provision was made for any foreseeable losses.
 
Revenue arising from shipping activities was mainly from freight income and charter income. Freight income and the 
relevant discharged costs of cargoes loaded onto vessels up to the reporting date were accrued for in the profit or loss 
based on percentage of completion method. Charter income was accrued on time accrual basis.
 
Revenue from sale of properties was recognised in the profit or loss when the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
of the properties had been transferred to the buyer.
 
Revenue arising from rental income of investment properties was recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the lease under the lease arrangement per note 34.
 
Revenue arising from assets yielding interest was recognised on a time proportion basis that takes into account the 
effective yield on the assets.
 
Revenue arising from investments yielding dividend was recognised when the shareholders’ right to receive payment 
was established.
2.23 Financing costs
 
Financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings and profit sharing margin on Islamic financing facilities, as 
well as accretion in provision due to the passage of time.
 
All interest and other costs incurred in connection with borrowings are expensed as incurred, other than that capitalised 
in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.21. The interest component of finance lease payments is 
accounted for in accordance with the policy set out in note 2.7.
2.24 Operating segments
 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn 
revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s 
other components, and for which discrete financial information is available. An operating segment’s operating results 
are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker, which in this case is the PETRONAS Executive Leadership 
Team, to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. 
2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.25 Fair value measurements
 
Fair value of an asset or a liability, except for lease transactions, is determined as the price that would be received to 
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement 
date. The measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the 
principal market or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market.
(i) 
Financial instruments
 
The fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organised financial markets are determined by 
reference to quoted market prices at the close of business at the end of reporting date. For financial instruments 
where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. Such techniques may include 
using recent arm’s length market transactions; reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is 
substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models. 
(ii) 
Non-financial assets
 
For non-financial assets, the fair value measurement takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that 
would use the asset in its highest and best use.
 
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group and the Company use observable market data as 
far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the input used in the 
valuation technique as follows:
• 
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identifiable assets or liabilities. 
• 
Level 2 –  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
• 
Level 3 – Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable input).
 
The Group and the Company recognise transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the date of the event 
or change in circumstances that caused the transfers.
2.26 Government grants
 
 
Government grants related to assets, including non-monetary grants at fair value, are deducted against the construction 
cost of the assets. Subsequently, the grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the life of the 
asset as a reduced depreciation expense.

Security
 
Property, plant and equipment of certain subsidiaries costing RM7,885 million (2017: RM4,466 million) have been pledged 
as security for loan facilities as set out in note 22 and note 23 to the financial statements.
Projects-in-progress
 
Included in additions to projects-in-progress of the Group is borrowing costs capitalised during the year of RM93 million 
(2017: RM24 million). The interest rate on borrowings costs capitalised is 3.2% - 3.3% (2017: 2.3% - 3.4%) per annum.
Restriction of land title
 
The titles to certain freehold and leasehold land are in the process of being registered in the subsidiaries’ name.
Change in estimates 
 
During the year, the Group and the Company revised the provision for decommissioning of oil and gas properties. The 
revision was accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimates resulting in an increase in cost of oil and gas 
properties by RM3,246 million and RM4,727 million of the Group and the Company respectively (see note 24).
Estimation of oil and gas reserves
 
Oil and gas reserves are key elements in the Group’s and the Company’s investment decision-making process. Estimation 
of oil and gas reserves are conducted using industry recognised method. 
 
 
The term “reserves” describes the recoverable quantity of oil and gas volumes that are commercially viable for development 
given the prevailing economic situation present at the time of estimation.
3. 
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTINUED)
Estimation of oil and gas reserves (continued)
 
Reserves estimates are normally presented alongside the range of level of certainties namely P1 (high level of certainty for 
proved reserves), P2 (mean level of certainty for probable reserves) and P3 (low level of certainty for possible reserves). The 
level of certainties depends on the availability and understanding of the geological and reservoir data available at the time 
of estimation and is normally represented in the form of probability distribution.
 
The reserves are further subdivided into developed and undeveloped categories. Developed reserves are reserves 
expected to be recovered through existing wells and facilities under the operating conditions that have been designed for. 
Undeveloped reserves are reserves to be recovered from approved and sanctioned projects and remain so until the wells 
are drilled, completed and production commences which would by then be classified as developed.
 
Estimations of reserves are reviewed annually. These estimates are inherently imprecise, require the application of 
judgements and are subject to regular revision, either upward or downward, based on new information available such as 
new geological information gathered from the drilling of additional wells, observation of long-term reservoir performance 
under producing conditions and changes in economic factors, including product prices, contract terms or development 
plans. 
 
Such revisions will impact the Group’s and the Company’s reported financial position and results which include:
(i) 
carrying value of oil and gas properties and their corresponding amortisation charges;
(ii) 
carrying value of projects-in-progress;
(iii) provisions for decommissioning and restoration; and
(iv) carrying value of deferred tax assets/liabilities.
Impairment review of property, plant and equipment
 
As at 31 December 2018, the Group recognised net write-back of impairment losses on certain property, plant and 
equipment amounting to RM3,532 million (2017: RM347 million). The impairment losses written back are primarily related 
to oil and gas properties mainly as a result of positive outlook on sales of oil and gas and cost optimisation. 
 
As at 31 December 2018, the Company recognised net impairment losses on certain property, plant and equipment 
amounting to RM170 million (2017: write-back of impairment losses charged amounting to RM2,838 million) in cost of 
revenue. 
 
In arriving at the net impairment write-back amounts, the carrying amount of each previously impaired cash-generating 
unit is compared with the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit. The impairment write-back is limited only to 
the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
 
The Group’s and the Company’s recoverable amount for the relevant impaired and previously impaired cash-generating 
units of RM32,185 million (2017: RM63,365 million) and RM Nil (2017: RM10,344 million) respectively were determined from 
the value in use calculations using cash flow projections and fair value less cost to sell. 
 
 
The Group and the Company use a range of long term assumptions including prices, volumes, margins and costs based 
on past performance and management’s expectations of market development. The projected cash flows were discounted 
using discount rates ranging between 7.5% and 14.0% (2017: 7.1% and 11.0%).

Impairment review of goodwill 
 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units which represent the lowest 
level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
 
In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit (including goodwill) is 
compared with the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less 
costs to sell and value in use. In the absence of any information about the fair value of a cash-generating unit, the value in 
use is deemed to be the recoverable amount. 
 
Included in goodwill is an amount of RM3,987 million (2017: RM3,987 million) arising from the acquisition of PETRONAS 
Lubricants Italy S.p.A Group (“PLI Group”). The recoverable amount of PLI Group unit was based on its value in use and was 
determined with the assistance of an independent valuer. The value in use was determined by using the discounted cash 
flow method based on management’s business plan cash flow projections for 5 financial years from 2019 to 2023, adjusted 
with an estimated terminal value. The cash flow assumes a long term growth rate of Nil (2017: Nil) and is discounted to 
present value using discount rate of between 7.2% and 7.4% (2017: 7.1% and 8.2%).
 
Based on the above, the recoverable amount of the unit of RM5,368 million (2017: RM5,450 million) was determined to 
be higher than its carrying amount of RM3,753 million (2017: RM3,753 million) and therefore, no impairment loss was 
recognised. 
 
The above estimates are sensitive in the following areas:
(i) 
A decrease of 0.5 percentage point in long term growth rate used would have reduced the recoverable amount by 
approximately RM251 million.
(ii) 
An increase of 0.5 percentage point in discount rate used would have reduced the recoverable amount by approximately 
RM362 million.
 
The value in use of other remaining goodwill is derived from the respective cash-generating units’ business plan cash flow 
projections for 5 financial years from 2019 to 2023, adjusted with an estimated terminal value. The cash flows assumes a 
long term average growth rate of the respective industries those units are engaged in and are discounted to present value 
using discount rate of 7.6% (2017: 7.5%).
 
Based on the above, the carrying amount of other goodwill of certain units were determined to be lower than their 
recoverable amount, thus no impairment loss was recognised during the year.
 
Impairment review of exploration expenditure
 
As at 31 December 2018, the Group recognised net impairment losses on certain exploration expenditure in cost of 
revenue amounting to RM66 million (2017: RM991 million), which are mainly related to certain wells no longer capable of 
commercial development. The impairment on wells costs will be subsequently written off in accordance with the policy set 
out in note 2.10.

In the normal course of business, the Group and the Company enter into derivative financial instruments to manage their 
normal business exposures in relation to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including 
management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt, consistent with risk management policies and 
objectives.
 
Certain subsidiaries of the Group adopt hedge accounting whereby hedges meeting the criteria for hedge accounting 
are classified as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instruments is recognised 
directly in equity until the hedged transaction occurs, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the profit or loss. As at  
31 December 2018, the balance recognised under capital reserves in equity amounts to RM15 million (2017: RM205 million). 
As these amounts are not significant to the Group, no further disclosure of hedge accounting is presented in the Group’s 
financial statements.

14. DEFERRED TAX (CONTINUED)
Unrecognised deferred tax assets (continued)
 
In accordance with the provision of Malaysian Finance Act 2018 requirement, the unused tax losses are available for 
utilisation in the next seven years, for which, any excess at the end of the seventh year will be disregarded. Deferred tax 
assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be 
available against which the subsidiaries can utilise the benefits.
 
Unabsorbed capital allowances and unused investment tax allowances do not expire under current tax legislation.
 
The Group and the Company have unused tax losses carried forward of approximately RM67,420 million (2017: RM67,301 
million) and RM25,020 million (2017: RM25,062 million) respectively, which give rise to the recognised and unrecognised 
deferred tax assets as above.
 
The Group also has unabsorbed capital allowances, unused investment tax allowances and unused reinvestment allowances 
of approximately RM10,850 million (2017: RM11,729 million), RM14,274 million (2017: RM13,344 million) and RM908 million 
(2017: RM925 million) respectively, which give rise to the recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets as above.

The above amount represents carrying values of net assets owned by the Group with the intention of disposal in the 
immediate future. 
 
Fair value information
 
In accordance with MFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, assets classified as held for sale 
were written down to their fair value less costs to sell.
 
The fair value of assets classified as held for sale are categorised as level 3.
 
The assets classified as held for sale are stated at fair value, and are determined based on the following:
 
Vessels
 
The fair value of vessels has been determined based on market comparable approach including the sale price offered by 
potential buyer.
 
Land and buildings
 
The fair value of land and buildings has been generally derived using sales comparison approach. Sales price of comparable 
properties in close proximity are adjusted for differences in key attributes such as property size. The most significant input 
into this valuation approach is price per square foot of comparable properties.
 
Plant and equipment, intangible assets, oil and gas properties and other net assets
 
The fair value of plant and equipment, intangible assets, oil and gas properties and other assets are determined based on 
the contracted price agreed with potential purchaser.

24. OTHER LONG TERM LIABILITIES AND PROVISIONS (CONTINUED)
 
Provision for decommissioning of oil and gas properties and other property, plant and equipment is recognised when 
there is an obligation to abandon a facility or an item of property, plant and equipment and to restore the site on which it is 
located, and when a reasonable estimate of that liability can be made. In the case of provision for decommissioning of oil 
and gas properties, the obligation is stipulated in production sharing contract (“PSC”) as described in note 39. 
 
Included in other long term liabilities of the Group and the Company are amount of abandonment cess payable to the PSC 
Contractors of RM2,400 million and RM7,077 million respectively as described in note 39.
 
The provision recognised is the present value of the Group’s and the Company’s obligations of the estimated future costs 
determined in accordance with current conditions and requirements. 
 
A corresponding asset of an amount equivalent to the provision is also created. This asset is depreciated in accordance with 
the policy set out in note 2.4. The increase in the present value of the provision for the expected costs due to the passage 
of time is included within finance costs.
 
The estimated decommissioning cost is uncertain as it relates to abandonment activities which will be undertaken in the 
future and subjected to the volatility of various factors including laws and regulations, technology, economy and political 
climate. To manage these changes and its impact on the carrying value of the provisions, regular reviews are performed 
by the Group and the Company on the key assumptions applied for the calculation including the decommissioning costs, 
discount and inflation rates used in discounting the cash flows as well as changes to the fiscal terms of the production 
sharing contracts. The interest rate and inflation rate used to determine the obligation as at 31 December 2018 ranges from 
1.70% to 8.08% (2017: 1.52% to 8.50%) and 1.40% to 3.54% (2017 : 1.70% to 3.75%) respectively. Changes in the expected 
future costs are reflected in both the provision and the asset.
 
The movements of provision for decommissioning during the financial year are as follows:

Net changes in provision include foreign exchange gains or losses arising from retranslation of the provision and are 
adjusted against the carrying amount of the corresponding asset accordingly.
 
During the year, the Group and the Company refined the provision for decommissioning of oil and gas properties resulting 
from changes in estimated cash flows. The adjustment was accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimates 
resulting in the following:

Nature of goods and services
 
Sales of oil and gas products
 
Revenue from sales of oil and gas products namely petroleum products, crude oil and condensates, liquefied natural gas, 
natural gas, processed gas and petrochemicals is recognised when control of the goods has transferred to the customers. 
Depending on the terms of the contract with the customer, controls transfer either upon delivery of the goods to a location 
specified by the customers or upon delivery of the goods on board vessels or tankers for onward delivery to the customers. 
There is no significant financing element present as the Group’s and the Company’s sales of oil and gas products are made 
either on cash or credit terms as per the industry practices.
 
Construction contracts
 
Revenue from construction contracts is recognised progressively based on percentage of completion method determined 
by reference to the completion of the physical proportion of contract work to date. The amount receivable from the 
customers is based on agreed milestones as per the terms of the contract.
 
Sales of properties
 
Revenue from sales of properties is recognised when control of the properties has been transferred to the buyer. There is 
no significant financing element present as the Group’s sales of properties are made on credit terms as per the industry 
practices.
 
Transaction price allocated to performance obligations 
 
The Group and the Company entered into long term contracts for the sales of various oil and gas products with remaining 
tenures ranging between 2 to 22 years. The future revenue of the Group and of the Company is dependent on the 
prevailing market price, exchange rate on the transaction date as well as production volume, which is based on contractual 
requirements.
 
In addition to the above, the Group and the Company entered into spot and short term contracts for the sales of various oil 
and gas products with remaining tenures less than 1 year. 
 
No further disclosure on the remaining performance obligations and its comparative are presented in the Group’s financial 
statements in line with MFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers practical expedients.
 
The Group also entered into long term construction contracts. As at 31 December 2018, total outstanding performance 
obligations is not significant to the Group. Hence, no further disclosure is presented in the Group’s financial statements.

meritorious defence to the claim. The Company cannot estimate with sufficient reliability the ultimate financial obligation, 
if any, of this legal suit, since it has not gone for full trial yet.
 
Financial guarantee
 
 
The Company provides unsecured financial guarantees to various financial institutions in respect of borrowing facilities 
granted to a subsidiary amounting to RM2,064 million expiring in 2021 and certain joint arrangements of the Group 
amounting to RM16,578 million expiring in 2019.
 
Other guarantees
 
Other than those disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements, the Group and the Company had entered into agreements 
which may include agreements to provide guarantees to third parties for the benefit of subsidiaries, associates and joint 
ventures (“Guaranteed Entities”). Such unsecured guarantees are normally provided in support of the Guaranteed Entities’ 
normal and on-going business requirements, consistent with generally acceptable and recognised industry practices. The 
liability of the Group and the Company is therefore contingent and would only trigger upon the default of the Guaranteed 
Entities’ obligation under the guarantee.
37. RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES
 
For the purpose of these financial statements, parties are considered to be related to the Company if the Company has the 
ability, directly or indirectly, to control or jointly control the party or exercise significant influence over the party in making 
financial and operating decisions, or vice versa, or where the Group or the Company and the party are subject to common 
control. Related parties may be individuals or other entities.
 
Related parties also include key management personnel defined as those persons having authority and responsibility for 
planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group either directly or indirectly and an entity that provides key 
management personnel services to the Group. The key management personnel comprises all the Directors of the Company.
 
The Company’s related parties include key management personnel, subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures as well as the 
Government of Malaysia and its related entities as the Company is wholly-owned by the Government of Malaysia.

38. OPERATING SEGMENTS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION
 
The Group has two reportable operating segments comprising Upstream and Downstream. Each reportable segment offers 
different products and services and are managed separately because they require different technology and marketing 
strategies. During the financial year, there has been a change in the way of certain activities are managed. Accordingly, 
the Group has restated the operating segment information for the prior period. The following summary describes the 
operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments:
• 
Upstream - activities include oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, together with related 
pipeline and transportation activities as well as purchase and liquefaction of natural gas and marketing and trading of 
liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and processed gas.
• 
Downstream - activities include the supply and trading, refining, manufacturing, marketing and transportation of crude 
oil, petroleum and petrochemical products as well as gas processing operations and power business.
 
Corporate and others comprise primarily logistic and maritime segment, property segment, central treasury and project 
delivery and technology function. 
 
For each of the reportable segment, the Group chief operating decision maker, which in this case is the PETRONAS Executive 
Leadership Team, reviews internal management reports at least on a quarterly basis.
 
There are varying levels of integration between Upstream segment, Downstream segment and others. This integration 
includes transfers of products and services between segments. Inter-segment pricing is established on a commercial basis.
 
Inter-segment revenues includes sales of crude oil and condensates, petroleum products, sales gas and shipping services 
between business segments. These transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
 
Performance is measured based on segment profit after tax (“PAT”), as included in the internal management reports. 
Segment PAT is used to measure performance as the Executive Leadership Team believes that such information is the most 
relevant in evaluating the results of the segments.
 
Segment assets are measured based on total assets (including goodwill) of a segment, as included in the internal management 
reports and are used to measure the return of assets of each segment.
 
Segment liabilities information is neither included in the internal management reports nor provided regularly to the Executive 
Leadership Team. Hence, no disclosure is made on segment liability.
 
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the financial year to acquire non-current assets other than 
financial instruments and deferred tax assets.

39. PETROLEUM ARRANGEMENTS
 
The Petroleum Development Act, 1974 vests the entire ownership, rights, powers, liberties and privileges of exploiting 
petroleum resources on land and offshore Malaysia in PETRONAS.
 
Production sharing contracts
 
The monetisation of petroleum resources is carried out primarily by means of production sharing contracts (“PSCs”) 
between PETRONAS and its subsidiaries and other oil and gas companies (“PSC Contractors”). Under the terms of the 
various PSCs, the PSC Contractors shall bear all the costs and recover their costs in barrels of crude oil or gas equivalent in 
accordance with the terms of their respective PSCs.
 
Certain terms of the PSCs are:
(i) 
Research cess, supplemental payments and crude oil or gas entitlement
 
The determination of research cess, supplemental payments, and PETRONAS’ and the PSC Contractors’ entitlements 
to crude oil or gas produced subsequent to 31 December 1992 has been based on the returns submitted by the PSC 
Contractors and is dependent on agreement being reached on the method of valuation of crude oil or gas and the 
quantum of costs incurred and claimed by contractors subject to the maximum rate provided under the respective 
PSCs for the year. PETRONAS’ entitlements to crude oil and natural gas are taken up as income on the basis of liftings 
and sales respectively made by the Company.
39. PETROLEUM ARRANGEMENTS
Production sharing contracts (continued) 
(ii) 
Property, plant and equipment
 
Title to all equipment and other assets purchased or acquired by the PSC Contractors exclusively for the purpose of 
petroleum operations, and which costs are recoverable in barrels of cost oil or gas equivalent, is vested with PETRONAS. 
However, the values of these assets are not taken up in the financial statements of PETRONAS other than: 
• 
the property, plant and equipment of a subsidiary which is also a contractor to PETRONAS under certain PSCs; 
and
• 
the estimated costs of decommissioning and removing the assets and restoring the site on which they are located 
where there is an obligation to do so.
(iii) Inventories
 
Title to all crude oil held in inventories by the PSC Contractors lies with PETRONAS and title to the contractors’ 
entitlement passes only upon delivery at point of export.
(iv) Abandonment
 
The PSCs stipulate the rights and obligation of PETRONAS and the PSC Contractors (“PSC Parties”) in relation to the 
abandonment of the oil and gas properties. The PSC Contractors have the obligation to undertake abandonment 
activities during the PSC period except for certain PSCs or facilities where the abandonment obligation lies with 
PETRONAS.
 
In addition, the PSC Contractors are also required to make abandonment cess contribution to Abandonment Cess Fund 
via PETRONAS in accordance with the terms of the PSCs. The PSC Contractors have the rights to request PETRONAS 
to reimburse the abandonment cess up to the cumulative amount paid upon the execution of the abandonment 
activities.
 
Risk service contracts
 
The monetisation of petroleum resources is also carried out by means of risk service contracts (“RSCs”). Under the terms of 
the RSCs, the RSC Contractors provide services for the development and production of oil and gas resources on behalf of 
PETRONAS.
 
Certain terms of the RSCs are:
(i) 
Cost reimbursement and remuneration fees 
 
RSC Contractors incur all upfront costs and will be reimbursed upon first commercial production. Under the terms of the 
RSCs, PETRONAS owns the title to all equipment and other assets purchased or acquired by the RSC Contractors for the 
purpose of petroleum operations. The values of these assets are taken up in the financial statements of PETRONAS upon 
incurrence, together with the estimated costs of decommissioning the assets where there is an obligation to do so.
 
The RSC Contractors are also entitled to remuneration fees which commensurate with their performance under the 
contract. All payments of remuneration fees are recognised as expenditures in PETRONAS’ financial statements.

Company’s business, comprise credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk relating to interest rates, foreign currency exchange 
rates, equity prices and commodity prices.
 
The Group has policies and guidelines in place that sets the foundation for a consistent approach towards establishing an 
effective financial risk management across the PETRONAS Group.
 
Risk taking activities are undertaken within acceptable level of risk or risk appetite, whereby the risk appetite level reflects 
business considerations and capacity to assume such risks. The risk appetite is established at Board level, where relevant, 
based on defined methodology and translated into operational thresholds.
 
The Group’s and the Company’s goal in risk management are to ensure that the management understands, measures and 
monitors the various risks that arise in connection with their operations. Policies and guidelines have been developed to 
identify, analyse, appraise and monitor the dynamic risks facing the Group and the Company. Based on this assessment, 
each business unit adopts appropriate measures to mitigate these risks in accordance with the business unit’s view of the 
balance between risk and reward.
 
Credit risk
 
Credit risk is the potential exposure of the Group and of the Company to losses in the event of non-performance by 
counterparties. The Group’s and the Company’s exposures to credit risk arise principally from their receivables from 
customers, fund and other investments and financial guarantees given to financial institutions for credit facilities granted 
to subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. Credit risks are controlled by individual subsidiaries in line with PETRONAS’ 
policies and guidelines.
 
Receivables and contract assets
 
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
 
The Group and the Company minimise credit risk by ensuring that all potential third party counterparties are assessed 
prior to registration and entering into new contracts. Existing third party counterparties are also subject to regular reviews, 
including re-appraisal and approval of granted limits. The creditworthiness of counterparties is assessed based on an 
analysis of all available quantitative and qualitative data regarding business risks and financial standing, together with the 
review of any relevant third party and market information. Reports are prepared and presented to the management that 
cover the Group’s overall credit exposure against limits and securities, exposure by segment and overall quality of the 
portfolio.
 
Depending on the types of transactions and counterparty creditworthiness, the Group and the Company further mitigate 
and limit risks related to credit by requiring collateral or other credit enhancements such as cash deposits, letter of credit 
and bank guarantees.
 
Management has taken reasonable steps to ensure that receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are stated at their 
realisable values.

Receivables and contract assets (continued) 
 
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk (continued)
 
At each reporting date, the Group and the Company assess whether any of the trade receivables and contract assets are 
credit impaired.
 
The gross carrying amounts of credit impaired trade receivables and contract assets are written off (either partially or full) 
when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group or the Company determines 
that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts 
subject to the write-off. Nevertheless, trade receivables and contract assets that are written off could still be subject to 
enforcement activities.
 
Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
 
As at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk arising from trade receivables and contract 
assets are represented by the carrying amounts in the statement of financial position.
 
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt securities at FVOCI 
are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the 
estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.
 
Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:
(i) 
significant financial difficulty of the customer;
(ii) 
a breach of contract such as a default; or
(iii) it is probable that the customer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation.
 
Exposure to losses increases with concentrations of credit risk which may exist when a number of counterparties are 
involved in similar activities or operate in the same industry sector or geographical area, which may result in their ability to 
meet contractual obligations being impacted by changes in economic, political or other conditions. The Group’s principal 
customers with which it conducts business are located globally and there is no significant concentration of credit risk at 
reporting date.
 
Recognition and measurement of impairment loss
 
In managing credit risk of trade receivables and contract assets, the Group manages its debtors and takes appropriate 
actions (including but not limited to legal actions) to recover long overdue balances. 
 
The Group performs credit rating assessment of all its counterparties in order to measure Expected Credit Loss (“ECL”) of 
trade receivables for all segments using the PETRONAS Credit Risk Rating system. This credit rating assessment considers 
quantitative assessment using the counterparties’ financial statements or a qualitative assessment of the counterparties 
which includes but is not limited to their reputation, competitive position, industry and geopolitical outlook. 
 
In determining the ECL, the probability of default assigned to each counterparty is based on their individual credit rating. 
This probability of default is derived by benchmarking against available third party and market information, which also 
incorporates forward looking information.
 
Loss given default is the assumption of the proportion of financial asset that cannot be recovered by conversion of collateral 
to cash or by legal process, and is assessed based on the Group’s and the Company’s historical experience.

Fund and other investments
 
The Group and the Company are also exposed to counterparty credit risk from financial institutions, government and 
corporate counterparties through fund and other investment activities comprising primarily money market placement and 
investments in bonds and equities. These exposures are managed in accordance with existing policies and guidelines 
that define the parameters within which the investment activities shall be undertaken in order to achieve the Group’s 
investment objective of preserving capital and generating optimal returns above appropriate benchmarks within allowable 
risk parameters. 
40. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
Receivables and contract assets (continued) 
 
Fund and other investments (continued)
 
Investments are only made with approved counterparties who met the appropriate rating and other relevant criteria, and 
within approved credit limits, as stipulated in the policies and guidelines. The treasury function is governed by a counterparty 
credit risk management framework.
 
 
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts in the statement of financial position. The 
credit risk on a financial instrument is considered low, if the financial instrument has a low risk of default, the borrower 
has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term and adverse changes in economic 
and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its 
contractual cash flow obligations. The Company assumes that there is a significant increase in credit risk when it is past due.
 
As at the reporting date, the Group and the Company have invested 99% (2017: 99%) and 100% (2017: 100%) of the 
investments in domestic securities respectively.
 
The fund and other investments are unsecured, however, in view of the sound credit rating of counterparties, management 
does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligation. 
 
Financial guarantees
 
The Group and the Company provide unsecured financial guarantees to banks in respect of banking facilities granted to 
certain subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures (“Group entities”). The Group and the Company monitor on an ongoing 
basis, the results of the Group entities and repayments made by the Group entities.
 
The maximum exposure to credit risk for the Company amounted to RM18,642 million (2017: RM2,109 million), which 
represents the outstanding banking facilities of the entities as at reporting date. As at reporting date, there was no indication 
that any entities would default on repayment. The fair value of the financial guarantee recognised is disclosed in note 24.
 
Liquidity risk
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s exposure 
to liquidity arises principally from its trade and other payables, and borrowings. In managing its liquidity risk, the Group 
maintains sufficient cash and liquid marketable assets. The Company’s current credit rating enables it to access banking 
facilities in excess of current and immediate future requirements of the Group and of the Company. The Group’s borrowing 
power is not limited by its Articles of Association. However, certain covenants included in agreements impose limited 
restrictions on some of the debt level of PETRONAS’ subsidiaries.

40. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) 
 
Market risk
 
Market risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from change in market prices and their impact on the performance of the 
business. The market price changes that the Group and the Company are exposed to include interest rates, foreign currency 
exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other indices that could adversely affect the value of the Group’s and 
the Company’s financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.
 
Interest rate risk
 
The Group’s and the Company’s investments in fixed rate debt securities and funding through fixed rate borrowings are 
exposed to a risk of change in their fair values due to changes in interest rates. The Group’s variable rate borrowings are 
exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates. Investments in equity securities and short term 
receivables and payables are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.
 
All interest rate exposures are monitored and managed proactively in line with PETRONAS’ policies and guidelines. The 
Group enters into hedging transactions with respect to interest rate on certain long term borrowings and other debts where 
necessary and appropriate, in accordance with policies and guidelines.
 
The interest rate profile of the Group’s and the Company’s interest-bearing financial instruments based on carrying amount 
as at reporting date is as follows:

Since most of the Group’s and the Company’s financial assets and liabilities are fixed rate instruments measured at amortised 
cost, a change in interest rate is not expected to have material impact on the Group’s and the Company’s profit or loss.
 
Foreign exchange risk
 
The Group and the Company are exposed to varying levels of foreign exchange risk when they enter into transactions 
that are not denominated in the respective companies’ functional currencies and when foreign currency monetary assets 
and liabilities are translated at the reporting date. The main underlying economic currencies of the Group’s cash flows are 
Ringgit Malaysia and US Dollars.
40. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) 
 
Foreign exchange risk (continued)
 
The Group’s and the Company’s foreign exchange management policy are to minimise economic and significant 
transactional exposures arising from currency movements. The Group coordinates the handling of foreign exchange risks 
centrally typically by matching receipts and payments for the same currency. For major capital projects, the Group performs 
assessment of potential foreign exchange risk exposure at the investment decision phase to determine the appropriate 
foreign exchange risk management strategy. Residual net positions are actively managed and monitored against prescribed 
policies and control procedures. When deemed necessary and appropriate, the Group will enter into derivative financial 
instruments to hedge and minimise its exposures to the foreign currency movements.
 
The Group’s and the Company’s significant exposure to foreign currency risk, based on carrying amounts as at the reporting 
date is as follows:

Sensitivity analysis for a given market variable provided in this note, discloses the effect on profit or loss and equity as at  
31 December 2018 assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant market variable had occurred at 31 December 
2018 and been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date to show the effects of reasonably possible changes 
in price on profit or loss and equity to the next annual reporting date. Reasonably possible changes in market variables 
used in the sensitivity analysis are based on implied volatilities, where available, or historical data for equity and commodity 
prices and foreign exchange rates. Reasonably possible changes in interest rates are based on management judgment and 
historical experience.
 
The sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance because the 
Group’s actual exposure to market prices is constantly changing with changes in the Group’s portfolio of among others, 
commodity, debt and foreign currency contracts. Changes in fair values or cash flows based on a variation in a market 
variable cannot be extrapolated because the relationship between the change in market variable and the change in fair value 
or cash flows may not be linear. In addition, the effect of a change in a given market variable is calculated independently 
of any change in another assumption and mitigating actions that would be taken by the Group. In reality, changes in one 
factor may contribute to changes in another, which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
40. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

foreseeable market movements in the following currency exchange rates:

A depreciation in foreign currency rate above would have had equal but opposite effect, on the basis that all other variables 
remain constant.
 
Equity price risk
 
Equity price risk arises from the Group’s and the Company’s investments in equity securities. Exposures to equity price 
risk are managed in accordance to Group’s existing policies and guidelines. The Group and the Company monitor the 
equity investments on a portfolio basis and a performance benchmark is established for each investment portfolio giving 
consideration to portfolio objectives and return expectation. All buy and sell decisions are monitored by the Group Treasury 
Division.
 
The Group and the Company also hold equity investments that were previously classified as available-for-sale financial 
assets. During the year, these equity investments have been reclassified to FVTPL and FVOCI. Reports on the equity portfolio 
performance are submitted to the Group’s and the Company’s senior management on a regular basis.
 
The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to equity price risk based on carrying amounts as at the reporting date is as 
follows:

A decrease in price based on average change in index rate above would have had equal but opposite effect, on the basis 
that all other variables remain constant.
 
Commodity price risk
 
The Group is exposed to changes in crude oil, gas and petroleum products prices which may affect the value of the 
Group’s assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. To mitigate these exposures from a business perspective, the Group 
enters into various financial instruments. In effecting these transactions, the Group operates within policies, guidelines 
and procedures designed to ensure that risks are minimised. All financial instruments positions are marked-to-market by 
independent risk management department and reported to management for performance monitoring and risk management 
purposes on a daily basis.
 
Since the Group undertakes hedging using commodity derivatives for the majority of its transactions, a change in commodity 
price is not likely to result in a significant impact on the Group’s profit or loss and equity.
 
Fair value information
 
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short term receivables and payables, revolving credits and bank 
overdrafts reasonably approximate their fair values due to the relatively short term nature of these financial instruments.
 
The following table analyses financial instruments carried at fair value and those not carried at fair value for which fair value 
is disclosed, together with their fair values and carrying amounts shown in the statement of financial position.

Derivatives
 
The calculation of fair value for derivative financial instruments depends on the type of instruments. The fair value of interest 
rate swap agreements are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield 
curve over the remaining term of the instrument. The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is based on 
the fair value difference between forward exchange rates and the contracted rate. The fair value of commodity swap and 
commodity forward contracts is based on the fair value difference between market price at the date of measurement and 
the contracted price.
 
Non-derivative financial instruments
 
Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and 
interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the end of the reporting period.

41. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
 
The Group, as an essential part of its capital management strategy, is committed to a policy of financial prudence as 
outlined in the PETRONAS Group Corporate Financial Policy. The Group’s capital structure consists of consolidated equity 
plus debt, defined as the current and long term portions of the Group’s debt. 
 
The objective of the Group’s capital management is to maintain an optimal capital structure and ensure availability of funds 
in order to meet financial obligations, support business growth and maximise shareholders’ value. The Group monitors and 
maintains a prudent level of total debt to total assets ratio so as to enable compliance with all covenants. 
 
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. 
42. AMENDMENTS TO MFRS AND PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED BY MASB 
 
Adoption of new and revised pronouncements
 
As of 1 January 2018, the Group and the Company adopted the following pronouncements that have been issued by the 
MASB and are applicable as listed below:
 
Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018
MFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2014)
MFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Amendments to MFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Clarifications to MFRS 15
Amendments to MFRS 140 Investment Property: Transfers of Investment Property
IC Interpretation 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration
 
The principal changes in accounting policies and their effects are set out below:
i. 
MFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
 
MFRS 9 replaces the guidance in MFRS 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement on the classification 
and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, impairment of financial assets, and on hedge accounting. 
 
MFRS 9 contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model in 
which assets are managed and their cash flow characteristics. The new standard contains three principal classifications 
for financial assets: measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”) and fair 
value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) and eliminates the existing MFRS 139 categories of held-to-maturity, loans and 
receivables and available-for-sale. 
 
MFRS 9 also replaces the incurred loss model in MFRS 139 with a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) model. 
Under MFRS 9, loss allowances will be measured on either 12-month ECLs or lifetime ECLs. 
 
The Group and the Company generally applied the requirements of MFRS 9 retrospectively with practical expedients 
and transitional exemptions as allowed by the standard, as follows:
a) 
The Group has not restated comparative information for prior periods with respect to classification and 
measurement (including impairment) requirements. Differences in the carrying amounts of financial assets and 
financial liabilities resulting from the adoption of MFRS 9 are recognised in retained profits and reserves as at  
1 January 2018. Accordingly, the information presented for 2017 does not generally reflect the requirements of 
MFRS 9, but rather those of MFRS 139 Financial Instruments.
b)  The following assessments have been made on the basis of the facts and circumstances that existed at the date 
of initial application:
- The determination of the business model within which a financial asset is held.
- The designation and revocation of previous designations of certain financial assets and financial liabilities as 
measured at FVTPL.
- The designation of certain investments in equity instruments not held for trading as at FVOCI.
c)  
If an investment in a debt security had low credit risk at date of initial application of MFRS 9, the Group has 
assumed that the credit risk on the asset had not increased significantly since its initial recognition.

ii. 
MFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 
MFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers replaces the guidance in MFRS 111 Construction Contracts,  
MFRS 118 Revenue, IC Interpretation 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes, IC Interpretation 15 Agreements for 
Construction of Real Estate, IC Interpretation 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers and IC Interpretation 131  
Revenue – Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services. MFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
provides a single model for accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers, focusing on the identification 
and satisfaction of performance obligations. 
 
The initial application of the abovementioned pronouncements did not have any material impact to the financial statements 
of the Group and the Company except as mentioned in note 46. 
Pronouncements yet in effect
 
The following pronouncements that have been issued by the MASB will become effective in future financial reporting 
periods and have not been adopted by the Group and the Company in these financial statements:
 
Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019

Amendments to MFRS 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an 
Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
42. AMENDMENTS TO MFRS AND PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED BY MASB (CONTINUED)
Pronouncements yet in effect (continued)
 
The Group and the Company are expected to adopt the abovementioned pronouncements beginning from the respective 
dates the pronouncements become effective. The initial application of the abovementioned pronouncements are not 
expected to have any material impact to the financial statements of the Group and the Company except as mentioned 
below:
 
MFRS 16 Leases
 
MFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance in MFRS 117 Leases, IC Interpretation 4 Determining whether an Arrangement 
contains a Lease, IC Interpretation 115 Operating Leases – Incentives and IC Interpretation 127 Evaluating the Substance of 
Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.
 
MFRS 16 introduces a single, on balance sheet lease accounting for lessees. A lessee recognises a-right-of-use asset 
representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. 
There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases, leases of low-value items and variable lease payments. Lessor 
accounting remains similar to the current standard which continues to be classified as finance lease or operating lease. 
 
The Group and the Company have assessed the estimated financial impact on its financial statements upon initial application 
of MFRS 16. As allowed by the transitional provision of MFRS 16, the Group and the Company have elected the modified 
retrospective approach with no restatement of comparatives. From the preliminary assessment of a significant portion of 
the arrangements, the cumulative adjustments resulting from the initial application of MFRS 16 to be recognised in retained 
profits and reserves as at 1 January 2019, are estimated as follows:
In RM Mil
Estimated adjustments at 
1 January 2019
Group
Company
Increase in assets
5,760
8,925
Decrease in equity
762
47
Increase in lease liabilities
6,522
8,972
 
The Group and the Company are finalising the assessment of other arrangements. The final impact of adopting MFRS 16 on 
1 January 2019 is not expected to change significantly. 
 
For leases where PETRONAS Group is a lessor, there is no significant impact on leases as at 1 January 2019.
 
New pronouncement not applicable to the Group and the Company
 
The MASB has issued pronouncement which is not yet effective, but for which is not relevant to the operations of the Group 
and the Company and hence, no further disclosure is warranted. 
 
Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019
 
Amendments to MFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OPINION
We have audited the financial statements of Petroliam Nasional Berhad, which comprise the statements of financial position as 
at 31 December 2018 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, 
statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the year then ended, and 
notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, as set out on pages 138 to 277.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the 
Company as at 31 December 2018, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with 
Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2016 in Malaysia. 
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial 
Statements section of our auditors’ report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
INDEPENDENCE AND OTHER ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES
We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and 
Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ 
Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT 
to the members of Petroliam Nasional Berhad 
KEY AUDIT MATTERS (CONTINUED)
Impairment of property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) and intangible assets (“IA”)
Refer note 3 and note 10, respectively, to the Financial Statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Group operates in the oil and gas sector which has been 
affected by the volatilities of the oil and gas prices. This gives 
rise to a risk that the carrying amounts of the Group’s PPE 
and IA, especially in the Upstream operating segment might 
exceed their recoverable amounts, and consequently, the 
carrying amount may need to be impaired.
The Group has estimated the recoverable amount for each 
cash generating unit (“CGU”) by forecasting and discounting 
future cash flows relevant to the CGU. As a result, a net 
impairment write back of RM3,331 million (2017: RM347 
million) for PPE and net impairment loss of RM20 million 
(2017: RM1,745 million) for IA (refer note 27) was recognised 
in the current financial year.
We have identified the evaluation of the carrying amount of 
the Group’s PPE and IA of RM310,385 million (2017: RM327,458 
million) (refer note 3) and RM22,513 million (2017: RM22,079 
million) (refer note 10) respectively at 31 December 2018 as a 
key audit matter because:
• it is material to the consolidated financial statements and 
represents 52% (2017: 58%) of the Group’s total assets; and
• the estimation of recoverable amounts involved a significant 
degree of judgement exercised and assumptions made by 
the Group. Key judgemental aspects include assumptions of 
oil and gas prices, expenditures, production profile and the 
use of an appropriate discount rate.
Our audit procedures in addressing this key audit matter 
included, amongst others:
i) We considered the appropriateness of the Group’s 
determination of CGUs based on our knowledge of the 
Group’s business and its internal reporting.
ii) We evaluated judgement exercised and the following 
key assumptions used in the estimation of recoverable 
amounts, among others:
• 
production profile – assessed whether the production 
profile is within the field/reserve lives; 
• 
long term outlook of prices – compared to information 
published by external analysts;
• 
expenditures – compared to information included 
in the Group’s approved budget and actual historical 
information; and
• 
discount rate – involved our valuation specialist in 
challenging the appropriateness of the discount rate 
used.
iii) We have also considered the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures about those assumptions to which the 
outcome of the impairment assessment is most sensitive 
to.
Based on the above procedures, the carrying amount of the 
Group’s PPE and IA is appropriate.

KEY AUDIT MATTERS (CONTINUED)
Measurement of provision for decommissioning, dismantling, removal and restoration (“DDRR”)
Refer note 24 to the Financial Statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The provision outstanding for DDRR of the Group and the 
Company amounts to RM35,641 million (2017: RM18,935 
million) and RM16,451 million (2017: RM12,299 million) (refer 
note 24) respectively as at the end of current financial year, 
which represents 36% (2017: 19%) and 27% (2017: 23%) of the 
Group’s and the Company’s non - current liabilities.
The estimation of DDRR provision, especially for assets in the 
Upstream operating segment (“Upstream assets”), involves 
high level of judgement, complex calculations and estimation.
In addition, DDRR activities of the Group and the Company 
especially for Upstream assets are rather preliminary in nature 
given that majority of the assets are still in production stage. 
As such, there is limited historical information for which 
the Group and the Company can benchmark against to 
determine the expected future costs. These factors increase 
the degree of complexity and judgement in estimating the 
DDRR provision.
The Group and the Company review the DDRR provision on 
an annual basis, which includes an assessment of the interest 
rate, inflation rate and expected future costs.
Our audit procedures in addressing this key audit matter 
included, amongst others:
i) We agreed the data used in the calculation of the DDRR 
provision to the originating source.
ii) We evaluated the following key assumptions used in the 
DDRR provision calculation, among others:
• 
interest and inflation rates – compared to information 
from external sources; and 
• 
expected future costs – compared to costs incurred 
on recent similar transactions.
iii) We re-performed the calculation of the DDRR provision to 
determine mathematical accuracy.
Based on the above procedures, the measurement of provision 
for DDRR of the Group and the Company are appropriate.
INFORMATION OTHER THAN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AUDITORS’ REPORT THEREON 
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the Directors’ Report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our 
auditors’ report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the Directors’ Report and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the 
Directors’ Report and, in doing so, consider whether the Directors’ Report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements 
of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the Directors’ Report, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that 
give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards 
and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the 
Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the ability 
of the Group and of the Company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to 
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we 
exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
• 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control of the 
Group and of the Company. 
• 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the Directors.
• 
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on 
the ability of the Group or of the Company to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group

topographical studies, geophysical and seismic surveys, and 
drilling of wells.
F
Feed-in-Tariff (FiT)
Malaysia’s FiT system is a policy mechanism designed to 
accelerate investment in renewable energy technologies. 
It requires Distribution Licensees (DLs) to buy electricity 
produced from renewable resources from Feed-in Approval 
Holders (FIAHs) and sets the rate. The DLs will pay for 
renewable energy supplied to the electricity grid for a specific 
duration. The goal of FiT is to offer cost-based compensation 
to renewable energy producers, providing the price certainty 
and long-term contracts that help finance renewable energy 
investments.
F
Field
A geographical area overlying a hydrocarbon reservoir.
Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG)
Either a ship or barge that can sail or be towed to offshore gas 
fields, extract gas, freeze it to Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and 
offload the LNG to carriers for shipping.
Floating Production Unit (FPU)
Floating structures of various designs used in offshore 
production. These ‘floaters’ replace traditional fixed platforms 
and they are moored to the ocean bed. FPU is more 
commonly used in deepwater. See Deepwater.
Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO)
A converted or custom-built ship-like structure, with modular 
facilities to process oil and gas and for temporary storage of 
the oil prior to transfer to carriers/tankers.
Floating, Storage and Offloading (FSO)

A refinery process to convert natural gas or other gaseous 
hydrocarbons into longer chain hydrocarbons, such as 
gasoline or diesel fuel. It is used predominantly in the creation 
of high-quality transportation fuels.
Gearing Ratio
Total adjusted debt expressed as a percentage of adjusted 
debt and total equity. Total adjusted debt is the total debt 
including provision for decommissioning of assets. 
Greenhouse Gases (GHG)
Gases that trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, e.g. carbon 
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, 
perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride.
H
Heavy Oil/Bitumen
Unlike conventional crude oil that can be pumped without being 
heated or diluted, heavy oil is oil that cannot be extracted in its 
natural state via a well and conventional production methods. 
This definition is also applicable to bitumen.
High Pressure High Temperature Well
Well with a surface shut-in pressure greater than 10,000 psi 
and a bottomhole temperature greater than 150ºC.
Heads of Agreement (HOA)
A non-binding document outlining the main issues relevant 
to a tentative partnership agreement. HOA represents the 
first step on the path to a full legally binding agreement 
or contract, and serves as a guideline for the roles and 
responsibilities of the parties involved in a potential 
partnership before any binding documents are drawn up.
I
Integrated Oil and Gas Company
A company that engages in all aspects of the oil and gas 
industry - exploring for and producing crude oil and natural 
gas (upstream); refining, marketing and transporting crude 
oil, natural gas and refined products (downstream); as well as 
manufacturing and distributing petrochemicals.
Ionic Liquids
Liquids that comprise entirely of positive and negatively 
charged ions. Ionic liquids are being explored for an array of 
applications, e.g. as environmentally friendly substitutes for 
volatile organic compounds in the oil and gas industry. 
Improved Oil Recovery (IOR)
Improved Oil Recovery that is commonly used to describe any 
process, or combination of processes, that may be applied 
to economically increase the cumulative volume of oil that 
is ultimately recovered from the reservoir at an accelerated 
rate. IOR may include chemical, mechanical, physical, or 
procedural processes.
Improved Gas Recovery (IGR)
Refers to the recovery of gas by injection of fluids beyond the 
normal recovery through conventional methods. In recent 
times, carbon dioxide is used as a lubricant fluid to recover 
additional gas from the reservoir and thereby provides an 
avenue for storing the captured carbon dioxide.
J
Joint-Venture
A partnership between two or more companies to undertake a 
specific project and share the resulting profit and loss.

plant that accepts deliveries of LNG and processes it back into 
gaseous form for injection into a pipeline system.
Refining
A purification process for natural resources which includes 
hydrocarbons, using distillation, cooling and/or compression.
R
Return on Average Capital Employed
Adjusted profit after taxation expressed as a percentage of 
average total equity and long-term debt during the year.
Return on Total Assets
Earnings before interest expense, interest income and tax 
expressed as a percentage of total assets. 
Renewable Energy
Energy derived from natural sources that are replaceable.
Reserves
Hydrocarbons which are anticipated to be recovered from 
known accumulations of hydrocarbons.
Reservoir
Any porous and permeable rock (usually sandstone or 
limestone/chalk and occasionally a normally impermeable 
rock which has been heavily fractured), thus providing 
interconnecting spaces through which oil/gas can flow.
Resources
Resources are defined as the total estimated quantities of 
petroleum at a specific date to be contained in, or that have 
been produced from known accumulations of hydrocarbon.
Resource Replenishment Ratio
Figures reported are calculated based on a formula of 
(Difference of Resource Base of current year and previous 
year + Production Volume of previous year)/(Production 
Volume of previous year).
Risk Service Contract (RSC)
In the context of this report, RSC refers to a petroleum 
arrangement between PETRONAS and any other company for 
the appraisal, development and/or production of petroleum 
in a contract area on behalf of PETRONAS whereby the 
PA Contractors are remunerated based on achieved Key 
Performance Indicators consisting of the agreed Cost, 
Schedule and Production level.
S
Seismic Data
The collection of stratigraphic data obtained by creating 
shockwaves through the rock layers. Reflection of these 
waves from anomalies within the rock layers are electronically 
recorded at surface. These recordings are then analysed to 
produce a stratigraphic representation of the surveyed area, 
which helps to deduce the structure of the underlying rock 
layers.
Shale Gas
Natural gas found in shale rock derived from underground 
shale deposits that are broken up by hydraulic fracturing. The 
process is needed to produce gas in commercial quantities as 
shale has low matrix permeability.
T
Throughput
The amount of output produced by a system, e.g. a refinery, 
plant, or pipeline, in a given period of time. 
Total Recordable Case (TRC) 
The sum of injuries resulting in fatalities, permanent total 
disabilities, permanent partial disabilities, lost work day cases, 
restricted work cases and medical treatment cases, but 
excluding first aid cases.
Total Recordable Case Frequency (TRCF)
This refers to the number of total recordable cases per million 
exposure hours worked during the period.
U
Unconventional Oil and Gas
Oil and gas that cannot be produced or extracted using 
conventional methods.
Upstream
The segment of value chain pertaining to finding, developing 
and producing crude oil and natural gas. These include oil and 
gas exploration, development and production operations; also 
known as Exploration & Production (E&P).
W
WTI Price
Stands for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark crude oil 
price in the US measured in USD per barrel, which refers to a 
type of high quality light crude oil.

About This Report
REPORTING FRAMEWORK, SCOPE AND BOUNDARIES
PETRONAS is embarking on its journey into Integrated Reporting with our Annual Report 2019. 
This report will therefore be guided by integrated reporting principles and best practices and aims 
to share balanced and transparent information about our value creation activities. While we are 
not a public listed company, we are committed to this process as a means of adding value for our 
stakeholders as it creates better visibility and allows an informed assessment of our operations. 
Covering our activities for the financial year ended 31 December 2019, this report will explain the 
Group’s purpose, its strategic intents and business performance, taking into account our external 
environment, stakeholder interests and risks. 
The report captures the financial and non-financial performance of PETRONAS for the period 
from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. In terms of reporting boundaries, we have factored in 
all business operations of the Group, locally and internationally, which include operations under 
our full control as well as subsidiaries. The report’s scope examines both internal and external 
impacts on the business as well as trends, opportunities and risks that could influence the Group’s 
value creation abilities over time.
In our endeavour to provide a holistic view of our operations, we are guided by the International 
Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) Framework.

WHAT
Long-term aspiration of meeting the world’s growing energy 
needs in a responsible and holistic manner
Cash generators are existing assets that provide strong 
and stable cash flows. Protecting and maximising 
these assets are paramount to provide a solid base for 
profitability and a foundation for growth.
Global trends are reshaping the energy landscape, 
consumption patterns and consumer demand. We must 
continue to build our capabilities and allocate resources 
to new businesses in order to capitalise on external 
disruptions and better position ourselves for the future.

PETROLIAM NASIONAL BERHAD (PETRONAS)
WHO WE ARE
WHO WE ARE
Our Business
Operating in 12 countries and with more than 4,000 
employees globally, GNE strives to ensure long-term value 
creation and profitable growth for our partners by providing 
innovative and end-to-end customer-centric solutions to 
secure new markets covering gas and renewable energy. 
Our aim is to provide reliable and accessible cleaner energy 
fuel through an integrated value chain to meet the growing 
global energy demand. 
LNG
PETRONAS is one of the world’s leading global LNG players 
and reliable LNG suppliers with over 35 years of experience. 
With a diversified portfolio of facilities across the globe, we 
have delivered more than 11,000 LNG cargoes to date.
Our portfolio of facilities includes world-class assets in 
Malaysia, Egypt, Australia and in the future, Canada. We 
have successfully commissioned the world’s first coal 
bed methane-to-LNG project in Gladstone, Australia. The 
integrated LNG Complex in Bintulu, Sarawak is one of the 
world’s largest LNG production facilities in a single location, 
with a total capacity of 29.3 million tonnes per annum. The 
facility which comprises nine production trains also maintains 
a world-class standard for plant reliability, enabling us to 
provide uninterrupted supply of LNG to our customers.
GAS AND NEW ENERGY
A PROGRESSIVE ENERGY AND SOLUTIONS PARTNER 
The world is undergoing an energy transition driven by climate change, accelerating 
the shift from fossil-based to zero-carbon energy sources. The rate of global 
environmental change and its resulting impact have accelerated the need to 
transition to a low-carbon economy and decarbonised world, while minimising 
the output of greenhouse gases. Gas and New Energy (GNE), encompassing the 
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), Gas and Power, and New Energy businesses, is a one-
stop centre for cleaner energy solutions, with a structure that reflects PETRONAS’ 
commitment to advance into the future as a cleaner energy solutions partner.
As a cleaner energy solutions partner, we strive to 
continuously push the boundaries in delivering innovative 
and customer-centric solutions to our customers. Custom-
built to liquefy, produce, store and offload LNG, the 
PETRONAS Floating LNG (PFLNG) is a facility that allows 
for the processing of LNG to be done offshore hundreds of 
kilometres away from land. Its versatility enables us to unlock 
remote and stranded fields that were previously uneconomical 
to explore, making it possible for us to monetise the potential 
of stranded fields far out at sea.
PETRONAS is the first global energy player to realise the 
floating LNG concept with the introduction of the PFLNG 
SATU in 2016 and continued to define the LNG industry with 
the introduction of our first deepwater floating LNG, the 
PFLNG DUA. Today, we are the first global energy company to 
own and operate two floating LNG facilities.
The world’s first floating LNG, the PFLNG SATU, successfully 
loaded 10 LNG cargoes in 2019, after its relocation from the 
Kanowit gas field in Sarawak to the Kebabangan gas field in 
Sabah. This facility, which has the capacity to produce 1.2 
million tonnes of LNG per year, is capable of extracting natural 
gas from gas field in water depths up to 200 metres via a 
flexible subsea pipeline for the liquefaction, production, storage 
and offloading processes of LNG at the offshore gas field.
Our Business
The PFLNG DUA, on the other hand, officially sailed away from 
Geoje Island, South Korea towards Rotan gas field offshore 
Kota Kinabalu, Sabah on 18 February. It is currently undergoing 
its commissioning phase. This facility which is scheduled for 
commercialisation by end of 2020 is capable of reaching gas 
field in water depths up to 1,500 metres and able to produce 1.5 
million tonnes of LNG per year. Both our floating LNG facilities 
support PETRONAS’ portfolio of LNG facilities around the 
world, enabling us to achieve close to 30 million tonnes of LNG 
in sales annually to power the world.
Operating in a manner that is commercially, environmentally 
and socially sustainable, PETRONAS is committed to 
investing and building capabilities in the communities where 
we operate. This commitment drives us to innovate and 
consistently deliver value to our partners, stakeholders and the 
investors in our business. 
Our LNG capabilities capture the best value across the LNG 
value chain by offering the most competitive value propositions 
to our customers. Additionally, our portfolio of innovative 
technology and engineering solutions provides us with agility 
and flexibility to meet our buyers’ energy needs. We offer highly 
customised LNG ship-to-ship transfer solution to meet the 
needs of buyers with smaller LNG parcels. Gassing Up Cooling 
Down (GUCD) service is also being offered at Pengerang 
Regasification Terminal (RGT) to serve post dry-dock and warm 
LNG vessels. Whereas at Bintulu, we provide Cooling Down 
service to serve warm LNG vessels. Bunkering service will also 
be offered to LNG-fuelled vessels from mid-2020 onwards.
Our integrated LNG value chain solutions allow us to deliver 
abundant gas resources in a manner that is reliable, flexible, 
affordable and sustainable. This enables us to deliver cleaner 
energy to meet the needs of emerging markets, while 
supporting the world’s transition towards a low-carbon future.
GAS AND POWER
Gas will continue to play a crucial role in powering Malaysia, 
as it is the cleanest burning fossil fuel and a reliable source 
of energy, making it a complementary partner to renewable 
energy towards a low-carbon energy future. Without 
intervention and strong advocacy, domestic gas industry 
growth and sustenance will be tapered. Therefore, heightened 
efforts are necessary in collaboration with the government 
and agencies to shape and influence the long-term energy 
policy as part of the national development agenda.
PETRONAS is well-positioned as a one-stop solutions partner 
in delivering natural gas, leveraging our world-class asset 
performance and diversified portfolio of customer segments.
Within Peninsular Malaysia, PETRONAS, through its majority-
owned subsidiary, PETRONAS Gas Berhad (PGB), operates 
the Peninsular Gas Utilisation (PGU) system, comprising six 
processing plants and approximately 2,623 km of pipelines to 
process and transmit gas to end-users in the power, industrial 
and commercial sectors.
PETRONAS processes natural gas piped from offshore fields 
and transports the processed gas via the PGU pipeline network 
to customers in Malaysia and Singapore. In addition, it supplies 
steam and industrial gas to customers at the Kertih Integrated 
Petrochemical Complex in Terengganu and Gebeng Industrial 
Area in Pahang.
Malaysia’s very first LNG Regasification Terminal in Melaka 
and the Regasification Terminal in Pengerang, facilitate the 
importation of LNG by PETRONAS and third parties, while 
establishing security of gas supply for the nation.
Through PETRONAS Energy & Gas Trading (PEGT), the trading 
and marketing arm of PETRONAS for processed gas in 
Malaysia and Singapore, PETRONAS sustains its competitive 
advantage of having a vast portfolio of reliable and quality 
gas supplies, access to infrastructure and facilities, and a 
diversified portfolio of customers’ segments including Power, 
Non-Power, Reticulation and Exports. We have started the 
groundwork to offer a Virtual Pipeline System (VPS) to safely 
transport LNG sourced from the Pengerang Regasification 
Terminal to off-grid customers located away from the main 
pipeline, via ISO tank trucks.
NEW ENERGY
The establishment of New Energy places PETRONAS in 
a prime position to pursue domestic and international 
renewables market share to power the world with cleaner 
energy. PETRONAS first ventured outside the traditional 
energy space in 2013, with its first solar photovoltaic (PV) 
project in Pahang, Malaysia, with a solar capacity of 10 MWp. 
By 2018, PETRONAS increased its renewable energy capacity 
to a total of 14 MWp through four new solar energy projects 
located at PETRONAS facilities in Malaysia and Italy.
Since then, PETRONAS has cemented its aspiration in 
becoming a key player in the global renewable energy space 
with the acquisition of Amplus Energy Solutions Pte Ltd (M+) 
in April 2019, our very first international solar venture. With a 
total capacity of 600 MWp under operation and development, 
M+ is serving more than 150 commercial and industrial 
customers at over 200 locations across India, the Middle East 
and Southeast Asia.
In October 2019, PETRONAS continued its expansion as 
a renewable energy solutions partner with the launch of 
its first rooftop solar solution in Malaysia, known as M+ 
by PETRONAS. M+ by PETRONAS offers a wide variety of 
affordable and customer-centric solar energy solutions. 
These solutions include on-site rooftop solar, off-site solar 
and advanced analytics energy monitoring solutions.
Moving forward, PETRONAS’ focus in the renewable 
energy space will be in solar and wind, which possess the 
highest growth potential given the continuous technology 
improvements leading to decreasing costs. In line with the 
global industry outlook, PETRONAS’ renewable energy venture 
will be concentrated in Asia-Pacific, where its anticipated 
demand capacity increase is the highest among other regions.

Sustainability at 
PETRONAS
Sustainability is embedded in everything PETRONAS does. We have long realised the importance 
of sustainability in the context of running a strong, responsible and ethical business. As times 
and stakeholder concerns change, we must also keep step. The PETRONAS Sustainability 
Agenda is thus an evolving one, inspired by our new Statement of Purpose that calls on us to be 
a progressive energy and solutions partner enriching lives for a sustainable future. This Agenda 
is governed by the highest levels of management, underscoring its significance to the Group. 
We are focusing our efforts through four sustainability lenses that are aligned with seven United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as we play our role to actively put the world on a 
more sustainable path when pursuing business performance.
OUR SUSTAINABILITY LENSES
The four sustainability lenses of Continued Value Creation, Safeguard the Environment, Positive Social Impact and Responsible 
Governance enable PETRONAS to have a broad and comprehensive view of every part of our business. We are acutely aware 
of the impact our business and its operations have on our stakeholders and wider communities. Therefore, we must continue 
to uphold the highest standards of governance with each and every step we take, to ensure our value creation activities are 
conducted responsibly, safeguard the environment and make positive social impact. 
Continued Value Creation 
PETRONAS aims to drive long-term business value 
creation through responsible investments. 
Safeguard the Environment
PETRONAS strives to collaboratively reduce 
environmental impact by transitioning to lower 
carbon energy solutions and deploying innovative 
operations and technologies. 
Positive Social Impact 
PETRONAS aims to create positive alliances with 
the communities where the company operates by 
protecting and adding value to the well-being of 
employees, partners and the society.
Responsible Governance
PETRONAS aims to safeguard the organisation’s 
commitment through upholding strong governance 
mechanisms and ethical business practices.
OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE 
In guiding our sustainability efforts, PETRONAS established the Corporate Sustainability Council in 2010. Since then, the Council 
has evolved into the PETRONAS Sustainable Development (SD) and Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE) Council in 
2019 to steer the development and implementation of SD and HSSE-related strategies across the Group.
The Council consists of senior management members, and in addition to its advisory role, also serves as a governance body 
to drive progress and solidify SD and HSSE excellence in PETRONAS. The Council meets on a quarterly basis, or more often if 
required, while established Working Groups will hold meetings and report progress to the Council.

Safety
The safety of our employees is of paramount 
concern and we remain dedicated in ensuring 
there is no loss of life, while mitigating the 
possibility of injuries. Ensuring our facilities, 
products and services are in accordance with 
all legal requirements and the industry’s best 
practices is important to us, as this will safeguard 
the health, safety and well-being of our 
employees, contractors and communities, as well 
as the environment.
Personal Safety
People, 
Reputation
Our pervasive Group Health, Safety, Security and Environment (GHSSE) culture is supported by proactive and 
comprehensive policies, frameworks and initiatives. We are intensively leveraging digital technology to drive our 
initiatives, with a recent system implementation that has helped us manage the fatigue levels of our transport 
drivers. 
Process Safety
People, 
Environment, 
Asset, 
Reputation
We are focused on safety through sustained vigilance, early prevention and mitigation. The deployments of the 
Process Safety Loss of Primary Containment Reduction (PSLR) and Fire Prevention and Mitigation Framework 
(FPMF) ensure a structured approach in managing process safety events. 
Crisis and Incident

We are optimally prepared to address any emergency or crisis that may affect the people on our assets. We 
conduct drills to gauge overall preparedness, carry out analyses of our evacuation procedures and have 
implemented a new Headcount Management System that uses radio-frequency identification (RFID). 
Security
People, Asset, 
Reputation
We proactively address physical and digital security preparedness against emerging technical, regulatory 
and societal challenges and ensure that it is carried out in a safe, secure and environmentally sound manner. 
Some of our initiatives included security risk assessments of our operations, an asset classification exercise to 
enforce stricter compliance level with the PETRONAS Mandatory Minimum Security Standards and stakeholder 
engagement to improve our overall knowledge and responses to security risks.
This Report is Framed on 
Our Material Topics
PETRONAS’ material topics are derived from periodic materiality assessments to 
drive relevance and provide meaningful impact in responding to the changing global 
environment. These topics are obtained through exhaustive inputs and verification 
by PETRONAS subject matter experts and stakeholders. As we began our Integrated 
Reporting journey in 2019, the Group undertook a revalidation exercise against our 
peers and found that our current material topics remain relevant and valid to address 
the overall industry risk, energy transition and stakeholders’ expectations. 
This Report is Framed on Our Material Topics
Moving forward, we have prioritised seven United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to drive the expectations of 
our Statement of Purpose. The commitment to implement these expectations is guided by the four lenses of our Sustainability 
Agenda, and will be measured and monitored against the relevant metrics and targets.

Climate Change and Environmental

We recognise the importance of our role as a 
player in the global energy sector to balance 
the issue of climate change with the challenge 
to sustainably produce affordable and reliable 
energy. It is also important for us to drive 
optimum use of hydrocarbons and water in 
our operations, embrace energy transition and 
support host countries in meeting their pledges 
to the Paris Agreement.
Climate Change
Environment, 
Reputation
The PETRONAS Climate Change Position and PETRONAS Carbon Commitments articulate our approach in 
addressing climate change, guiding us towards low-carbon energy solutions such as LNG and renewable 
energy, and include finding ways to mitigate emissions or to create value from them. The Group also supports 
host countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions and other global agreements to maintain and enhance our 
reputation as a responsible energy company.

Management
People, 
Environment, 
Reputation
The Group is constantly working to improve operational excellence and processes to reduce our impact on the 
environment. While much effort is expended in complying with standards and regulations, the Group also fully 
supports self-regulation to strengthen our compliance with environmental laws. We achieve this by having and 
adhering to internal standards to manage our emissions, wastewater, hazardous waste and use of other natural 
resources.
Biodiversity and 
Ecosystem Services
Environment, 
Reputation
We minimise and prevent disruptions to biodiversity and ecosystem services as this will have detrimental 
outcomes on the economy and the wider community. It is a natural response from PETRONAS to restore and 
nurture the ecosystems around us while we operate our assets, especially in the context of decommissioning 
and abandonment.
Health, Wellness and Workplace
Creating a healthy and productive working 
environment, while equipping our workforce 
with the relevant skills and a determined mindset 
is important to PETRONAS. Best practices in 
these areas enable us to deliver sustainable value 
and create a dedicated, productive and high-
performing workforce.
Health and 
Wellness
People, 
Reputation
The health and wellness of our employees and contractors are important for us, and we have gone beyond 
merely complying with health regulations to ensure we maintain the best levels of health and well-being. To 
this end, we continue to work hard to address health risk factors such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, 
inadequate sleep, mental health and unhealthy habits that can cause health issues.
Human Capital
People, 
Reputation
It is our aim to accelerate the development of our employees and to strengthen leadership capabilities 
to progress into leading roles. Through a variety of comprehensive and robust talent development and 
management programmes, we are building a strong talent pool to address succession planning, a key 
component for business sustainability. Talent development will always be a key agenda for PETRONAS, with an 
emphasis on leadership and functional competencies across disciplines.
Product Stewardship and Supply Chain
Effective supply chain management creates long-
term returns in investment while increasing our 
competitiveness. To support this from beginning 
to end, we have also realised the importance 
of implementing a robust structure to ensure 
a sustainable vendor chain and product safety 
across the entire life cycle of our products.
Product 
Stewardship
People, 
Environment, 
Reputation
We are focused on the long-term value creation opportunities generated through responsible product 
stewardship. As consumer demand for more green products grows, it becomes critical that Life Cycle 
Assessments are carried out by the Group on all its products, as they are able to determine the product’s social, 
economic and ecological impact at different life cycle stages, hence meeting an important stakeholder need.
Supply Chain
People, 
Reputation
PETRONAS is committed to managing its supply chain to extract optimal value, while also playing a leading role 
in supporting vendors in the energy sector. Annually, we prepare the PETRONAS Activity Outlook to provide 
local OGSE players with a two-year guide on where the industry is heading. In practical terms, we enable access 
to financing for small companies in our sector and we implement a special vendor development programme to 
strengthen local contractors in the energy sector, to name a few. This illustrates our role in ensuring Malaysia’s 
energy sector remains resilient and robust. 
Social Responsibility
The fair and ethical treatment of the communities 
around us and those who perform work for our 
business are important concerns for PETRONAS. 
We respect internationally recognised human 
rights in the context of our operations and how 
we interact with all other stakeholders. Investing 
in sustainable initiatives is in line with our purpose 
to contribute to the well-being of society, the 
environment and to uphold our position as a 
socially responsible organisation.
Human Rights
People, 
Reputation
We support human rights resolutely and we have implemented measures to positively manage our social 
performance in our business activities. PETRONAS is guided by its Human Rights Commitment, which was 
introduced in 2015, and have assessed our supply chain in 2019 to ensure that it is aligned with our labour and 
human rights practices. 
Corporate Social 
Responsibility
People, 
Environment, 
Reputation
Yayasan PETRONAS is the corporate social responsibility (CSR) arm of PETRONAS with the mission to contribute 
to the well-being of society. This foundation executes all of the Group's CSR programmes, focused on three 
main areas - Education, Community Well-Being and Development, and Environment. PETRONAS takes pride in 
contributing to the growth of the society in a sustainable environment for the long-term.

Letter from the Chairman
The global oil and gas industry faces an immediate 
headwind with the sharp decline in global oil prices 
driven by persistent supply overhang and pandemic-
driven demand disruption. We will have to brace
ourselves for unprecedented times, as the severe 
ripple effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will likely 
lead to a severe global economic slowdown in the 
coming months. 
Dear Stakeholders,
As I pen this message, the world is grappling 
with the COVID-19 pandemic, an event 
which is both unpredictable and unforeseen, 
but with implications far beyond what is 
normally expected and potentially, with 
severe consequences. The global oil and gas 
industry faces an immediate headwind with 
the sharp decline in global oil prices driven 
by persistent supply overhang and pandemic-
driven demand disruption. We will have to 
brace ourselves for unprecedented times, 
as the severe ripple effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic will likely lead to a severe global 
economic slowdown in the coming months. 
The long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may eventually redefine markets 
and result in structural shifts. As such, organisations including PETRONAS must 
remain agile to survive and thrive in a new age and a new decade, that will be 
signified by greater market turbulence. 
On behalf of the Board of Directors of PETRONAS Group, I am pleased to present the 
Annual Report of PETRONAS Group for the financial year ending 31 December 2019.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019
PETROLIAM NASIONAL BERHAD (PETRONAS)
Letter from the Chairman
NAVIGATING A VOLATILE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT 
The year under review was yet another highly challenging 
year for us as we continue to strive to create value amid 
increasingly difficult macroeconomic and geopolitical 
environments.
The global economy moderated to below 3 per cent in 2019, 
the weakest pace of growth since 2009. The sluggish global 
growth has dampened oil demand - amid a buildup in global 
supply, leading to the worsening glut in the oil markets and 
resulting in the plunge of Brent from an average of USD71 per 
barrel in 2018 to USD64 per barrel in 2019. 
As a Group, we were impacted by the lower average realised 
oil prices with revenue decreasing by 4 per cent year-on-year 
to RM240.3 billion. Similarly, net profit fell by 27 per cent to 
RM40.5 billion for the same period. 
Despite the bearish environment, I am pleased to inform 
that PETRONAS has returned over RM84.6 billion in the form 
of dividends, taxes, cash payments and export duty to the 
Federal and State Governments of Malaysia, a testimony of 
PETRONAS’ role as a responsible Corporate Citizen.
STRENGTHENING CULTURE OF INTEGRITY AND TRUST
At PETRONAS, our strong emphasis on individual and 
organisational integrity not only reflects our commitment to 
discharging our obligations as a trustee of the nation’s oil and 
gas resources, but also helps to ensure our long-term growth 
and sustainability. In this regard, PETRONAS is among the 
first in Malaysia to be certified with ISO 37001: Anti Bribery 
Management System back in November 2017. 
PETRONAS continues to strengthen the culture of integrity by 
embarking on the Corporate Integrity Advocacy Programme 
(CIAP) with the theme of “Corporate Liability”, to address 
changes in the corporate integrity landscape following the 
introduction of the corporate liability clause in the Malaysian 
Anti-Corruption Commission (Amendment) Act 2018. A major 
achievement in our integrity journey in 2019 was when 164 
PETRONAS Top Leaders took the PETRONAS Integrity Pledge, 
signifying PETRONAS’ continuous commitment in upholding 
high standards of governance and in combating any form of 
corruption within the organisation. 
Communications on the culture of integrity is also an 
important pillar in PETRONAS’ integrity journey. In 2019, 
PETRONAS conducted 64 integrity-related education 
and communication activities, for its internal and external 
stakeholders, locally and abroad, to cement a sustainable 
culture of integrity in the Group’s day-to-day operations.
I would like to take this opportunity to remind myself 
and members of the PETRONAS family that we hold the 
nation’s hydrocarbon resources in trust and we share the 
accountability to ensure its well-being, while we harness its 
potential for the benefit of the people and the nation. 
SUSTAINABILITY, A WAY OF LIFE
PETRONAS subscribes to the philosophy of conducting 
business in a socially responsible and holistic manner for 
long-term growth and sustainability. While responding 
to society’s growing demand for energy, we work in the 
best possible way to balance and integrate economic, 
environmental and social considerations into our business 
decisions.
In 2019, PETRONAS crafted its Sustainability Agenda aimed at 
providing focus and to better orchestrate the implementation 
of sustainable development elements in our business 
practices. Our Sustainability Agenda describes clearly four 
Lenses of Sustainability that embrace the importance of 
Environment, Social and Governance (ESG). The four lenses 
are Continued Value Creation; Safeguard the Environment; 
Positive Social Impact and Responsible Governance. 
These four lenses are a reflection of PETRONAS’ commitment 
to a solid long-term value creation that incorporates prudent 
ESG risk mitigations. Moving forward, our aim is to minimise 
the impact of our own footprint, while developing and 
delivering climate-friendly strategies and solutions. We do so 
because we are driven by our commitment to enrich lives for 
a sustainable future. 
CONTRIBUTING TO THE WELL-BEING OF SOCIETY 
PETRONAS defines achievement not just within the narrow 
confines of business growth and financial returns, but also in 
how we enrich the lives of the people, wherever we operate. 
PETRONAS’ corporate social responsibility efforts are steered 
and managed by its foundation, Yayasan PETRONAS. With 
the narrative “Where Good Flourishes” as a beacon, Yayasan 
PETRONAS is committed to ensuring that PETRONAS’ 
community efforts deliver value in order to achieve 
sustainable and scalable impacts.
Yayasan PETRONAS recognise that Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) are crucial in propelling 
the country towards becoming an advanced nation. In view 
of this, “Program Duta Guru” was launched with the objective 
to upskill 4,500 teachers to enhance Higher Order Thinking 
Skills in STEM, as a foundation to improve our nation’s 
competitiveness.
Letter from the Chairman
We believe that social progress should be inclusive and 
that we must provide access to a better quality of life for 
more Malaysians. Yayasan PETRONAS has embarked on 
MEKAR (Memampankan Ekonomi Rakyat) targeting the B40 
households with the objective of increasing their income by 
more than 50 per cent. We hope that over 3,000 households 
will benefit from the various entrepreneurial upskilling 
programmes under MEKAR and this in a small way will help to 
reduce incidence of poverty in the country.
LOOKING AHEAD TO 2020
As we look ahead to 2020, the year is expected to be fraught 
with numerous challenges arising from the COVID-19 
outbreak. The pandemic has plunged many nations into 
a new dimension of social, economic and commercial 
aftershocks. Although the oil and gas industry is accustomed 
to volatility and shocks, there is no precedent in recent 
history in dealing with the demand contraction resulting from 
the new global crisis. The year ahead is seriously uncharted. 
We must have faith to ride out the storm together as one 
team, one PETRONAS family, while supporting the nation's 
economic recovery.
The year ahead is seriously uncharted. 
We must have faith to ride out the 
storm together as one team, one 
PETRONAS family, while supporting 
the nation’s economic recovery.
The challenge we face in this unfamiliar territory will require us 
to be more agile and to build the capabilities needed to succeed. 
The introduction of our Statement of Purpose – 
“A Progressive Energy and 
Solutions Partner Enriching Lives 
for a Sustainable Future” 
not only serves as a response to the major changes as an 
integrated energy company, but to ensure PETRONAS’ long-
term sustainability as we transition to a lower carbon future 
as well as to remain resilient amid the volatile environment. 
CHANGES TO THE BOARD 
2019 is also a year that we bid farewell to our directors 
namely Tan Sri Amirsham Abdul Aziz, Tan Sri Muhammad 
Ibrahim, Dato’ Mohamad Idris Mansor, Datuk Siti Zauyah Md 
Desa and Mr Harry Menon. On behalf of the Board, I would 
like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation for their 
contribution, and I would like to wish them all the very best in 
their future endeavours.
I would like to extend a warm welcome to our new Board 
members namely, Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh and Encik 
Ahmad Faris Rabidin. These new additions to the Board 
collectively bring diversity of perspectives and wealth of 
commercial experience that will be crucial to PETRONAS in 
this trying period. 
APPRECIATION
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to express 
my heartfelt appreciation to Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin, 
President and Group Chief Executive Officer of PETRONAS, 
his Leadership Team, and certainly the entire PETRONAS 
family for their hard work, loyalty and dedication in delivering 
credible performance amid the challenging economic 
environment. 
I wish to record my warmest appreciation to our stakeholders, 
particularly our customers and partners for their continued 
support and trust in PETRONAS.
I would also like to take this opportunity to extend my 
gratitude to the Government of Malaysia, the State 
Governments and the Governments of PETRONAS’ host 
countries for their support, as well as to the members of the 
Board of Directors for their wise counsel and guidance.

RESILIENCE AMID CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS
The year 2019 was a challenging year for the industry. The global 
oil market was volatile as geopolitical instability, rising populism and 
protectionism dominated headlines throughout the year. The end of 
the year also saw the beginning of the COVID-19 health crisis, which 
has since then grown into a global pandemic, causing instabilities to 
economies and countries around the world. 
Despite these market challenges, PETRONAS delivered a 
commendable performance in 2019, with a revenue of RM240.3 
billion and Profit After Tax (PAT) of RM40.5 billion recorded. The lower 
oil price environment during the year under review contributed to 
the downward movement in revenue and PAT by 4 per cent and 27 
per cent respectively, compared with 2018. Excluding the impact of 
impairment, PAT stands at RM47.8 billion, which was a 6 per cent 
decrease from 2018.
PETRONAS also stayed the course with our Three-Pronged Growth 
Strategy with prudent measures in operational efficiencies and 
commercial excellence. Cash Flow From Operations (CFFO) improved 
for the third consecutive year to RM90.8 billion, up 5 per cent from 
2018 and Free Cash Flow (FCF) recorded a 9 per cent increase to 
RM43.0 billion in 2019. Capital Investment for 2019 amounted to 
RM47.8 billion, close to our capital expenditure (CAPEX) guidance of 
RM50 billion per year.
Overall, PETRONAS’ financial foundation remains robust with a healthy 
cash balance and a strong credit rating.
Amid all these challenges, PETRONAS has shown 
strong resilience as reflected in our operational and 
financial performance for the year 2019. Our progress 
and achievements in pursuing our Three-Pronged 
Growth Strategy demonstrate our perseverance and 
robustness as an integrated energy company against a 
challenging business landscape. 
We were steadfast in executing our strategies 
and sustaining our operational efficiencies while 
maintaining fiscal discipline. Above all, we are 
committed in delivering long-term value to 
our stakeholders by fulfilling the Amanah and 
responsibility as a progressive energy and solutions 
partner enriching lives for a sustainable future.

I am also pleased to share that PETRONAS paid RM54 billion 
in dividends to the Malaysian Government in 2019, which 
includes the RM30 billion special dividend declared in 2018. In 
fulfilling our responsibility to the nation, our contributions also 
extend to the National Trust Fund, which as at 31 December 
2019, stands at RM19.2 billion. PETRONAS remains as its sole 
contributor since the inception of the Fund in 1988. 
COMMITMENT TO HEALTH, SAFETY, SECURITY AND 
ENVIRONMENT
I am encouraged to report that PETRONAS continued to 
demonstrate a positive trend in our Health, Safety, Security 
and Environment (HSSE) performance. With 360 million 
man-hours recorded in 2019, we succeeded to reduce our 
fatal accident rate (FAR) to its lowest at 0.56 and achieved our 
lowest major loss of primary containment (LOPC) of eight in 
the past ten years. 
We will strive to deliver our best in ensuring a safe working 
environment through a strong generative HSSE culture, as 
there is still so much more that we need to do to ensure 
everyone goes home safely. This includes our commitment 
towards continuous enhancements and improvements in 
safety compliance by utilising Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 
big data analytics to improve safety and HSSE competencies.
By leveraging on our capabilities 
across the entire value chain, with 
renewable energy as an addition to 
our integrated portfolio, we strive 
towards finding the equilibrium 
of providing energy in a secure, 
affordable and sustainable manner 
that would help us navigate the 
energy transition towards a lower-
carbon future.
Overall, the Group was steadfast in delivering significant 
results for the year under review.

customer experience and influencing how services, products 
and solutions are designed, developed and delivered. Among 
these efforts, include our Digital Procurement platform, 
increased focus on Cyber Security and the launch of Setel – 
PETRONAS’ first e-payment app that integrates directly to the 
pumps, allowing drivers to purchase fuel from the comfort of 
their vehicles. As at December 2019, Setel has garnered more 
than 500,000 subscribers.
PETRONAS SUSTAINABILITY AGENDA
On the sustainability front, we recognise our role in 
providing access to reliable and secure energy for economic 
development and growth, underpinned by environmental 
sustainability. In this stride, we introduced the PETRONAS 
Sustainability Agenda in 2019, which outlines our commitment 
to conduct our business in a manner that delivers long-
term benefits defined under the four lenses of the 
sustainability agenda: Continued Value Creation, Safeguard 
the Environment, Positive Social Impact and Responsible 
Governance. 
In July 2019, we hosted the Malaysia Energy Roundtable 
in collaboration with the World Economic Forum (WEF), 
which ranked the country’s energy security and accessibility 
as among the top 20 of the 115 countries surveyed in its 
2019 Energy Transition Index. This is attributable to our high 
electrification rate, low usage of solid fuels, diverse fuel mix 
and high quality of electricity supply. However, improvements 
are still required to reduce Malaysia’s carbon emissions. 
The forum aimed to facilitate a public-private dialogue on 
the future of Malaysia’s energy landscape, and to foster an 
effective energy transition while balancing the priorities 
of energy security, economic growth, and environmental 
sustainability.
As we continue to ensure the energy security of Malaysia, 
PETRONAS has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emission to 49.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2024 as 
part of our efforts to support Malaysia’s National Determined 
Contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement. In addition, 
PETRONAS will continue to drive operational excellence 
across our integrated businesses that balances the demand 
for more energy at lower emissions, as well as collaborate 
with governments and energy-related stakeholders towards 
shaping forward-looking energy policies that will contribute 
towards the energy transition.
We pursued growth opportunities under Expanding 
Core Business 
 and grew our presence with the 
acquisition of seven offshore blocks, two blocks 
in Gabon and three new exploration, as well as 
two producing blocks in Brazil. Domestically, the 
Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) is ready to 
deliver its products to the market. In September 2019, 
cargoes of Euro 5 Diesel and Jet Fuel achieved its first 
lifting, while the petrochemical complex saw on-spec 
Polypropylene (PP), Linear Low-density Polyethylene 
(LLDPE) and Ethylene Glycols (EG) shipped from its 
terminal in Pengerang.
We made significant progress in renewable energy and 
specialty chemicals as part of our Stepping Out 
  
strategy. PETRONAS is primed to pursue domestic 
and international market share in renewable energy 
particularly in the solar energy space through our 
acquisition of Amplus Energy Solutions Pte Ltd (M+). 
We also completed the acquisition of Da Vinci Group to 
grow in the silicones business, as part of our foray into 
specialty chemicals.
• Recorded a higher production volume of 2.4 
million boe/d
• Awarded 6 new Petroleum Sharing Contract 
(PSC) in Malaysia
• Acquired 3 offshore blocks: 
- 2 Egypt 
- 1 Indonesia
• Completed the construction of our second 
floating LNG facility - PFLNG DUA
• Successfully acquired 7 offshore blocks:

We strengthened our resource base under Maximising 
Cash Generators 
 with the awarding of six new 
Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) in Malaysia and 
the acquisition of three international offshore blocks of 
which two are in Egypt and one in Indonesia. 
On the LNG front, we stepped up our efforts in providing 
a new supply source of cleaner energy. I am pleased to 
share that we completed the construction of our second 
floating LNG facility, PFLNG DUA in the fourth quarter 
of 2019. The facility is now undergoing installation 
activities in the Rotan Gas Field, offshore Sabah. Once 
operational, PFLNG DUA will join the ranks of PFLNG 
SATU as innovative technology solutions capable of 
unlocking the greater availability of natural gas from 
remote, marginal and stranded gas fields. PFLNG DUA 
will expand PETRONAS’ global LNG portfolio to meet the 
energy requirements for a low carbon future. 
Driven by our commitment for excellence in business delivery, 
93 per cent of our capital projects have successfully completed 
On Time, On Budget and On Scope, competitively and safely. 
Today, PETRONAS ranks as best-in-class for delivery of offshore 
facilities projects and consistently performs in the Top Quartile 
of the industry benchmark. 
As we gear towards the next phase of growth, we see 
technology as an important enabler for us to increase greater 
value across our integrated value chain. We have accelerated 
our digital efforts towards shaping new ways to capture 
more opportunities for our molecules, with improvements in 
FOCUSED EXECUTION OF PETRONAS’ THREE-PRONGED 
GROWTH STRATEGY
In 2019, we marked the 45th anniversary of PETRONAS with 
the introduction of a new Statement of Purpose –  
”A progressive energy and solutions partner enriching lives 
for a sustainable future”, to reflect the dynamic growth 
and aspiration that will take us into the next chapter of 
PETRONAS’ journey. 
As we evolve beyond our traditional portfolio of oil and gas 
into the broader energy space, we established the Gas and 
New Energy business in April 2019 to enable the company 
to play a greater role in cleaner energy and innovation by 
championing advocacy and energy solutions encompassing 
LNG, gas and power as well as renewable energy.

CONTRIBUTION TO NATION-BUILDING EFFORTS 
As we grow our presence across more than 50 countries, we 
have never lost sight of our responsibility to the nation. We 
continue to carry out our Amanah that entrusts PETRONAS 
with developing and maximising the value of the nation’s 
hydrocarbon resources towards supporting the growth and 
prosperity of Malaysia. 
In 2019, PETRONAS contributed 
more than RM285 million through 
various corporate social responsibility 
(CSR) initiatives and programmes in 
Education, Community WelI-Being 
and Development, and Environment. 
These efforts will continue under Yayasan PETRONAS, the 
philanthropic foundation of our company since its launch in 
March 2019. I am confident that the foundation will deliver on 
this long-term commitment and create positive social impact 
for all Malaysians. 
Our commitment to the nation also includes shaping the 
Malaysian oil and gas sector into a robust and competitive 
industry. Here, our collaboration with local oil and gas services 
and equipment (OGSE) players focuses on nurturing and 
developing their resiliency by providing the necessary enablers 
with the support of industry partners and agencies. I am 
encouraged by the developments achieved for the industry’s 
ecosystem in 2019:

OUR PEOPLE
In rallying our people towards the next chapter of PETRONAS’ 
journey, we launched our new Brand Positioning –  
“Passionate about Progress”  
which encapsulates the evolution of our internal culture 
towards inculcating a progressive mindset and openness to 
new possibilities of new solutions for a better energy future. 
As a global company, we operate with a strong foundation 
of merit and equality, irrespective of gender, age, nationality, 
ethnicity, educational background or religion. Diversity brings 
together different strengths and experiences that encourages 
and motivates talents to deliver with high performance 
culture. In 2019, PETRONAS received the Randstad Award 
for Most Attractive Employer in Malaysia and HR Excellence 
Award for Excellence in Leadership Development for Top 
Talent Management Strategy.
In developing a future-ready workforce, we invest heavily 
in building skillsets and capabilities to develop talents who 
possess the attributes of an “enterprise leader”, capable of 
rising to the challenges that will reshape and redefine the 
common operating procedures that we know today. While 
core fundamental skills of oil and gas are still required, we 
must leverage and expand capabilities in the areas of artificial 
intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to remain 
relevant and valuable for an organisation. We have established 
a Data Science Academy for this purpose. 
To date, over 48,000 employees across different nationalities 
stand united under the same purpose and intent of delivering 
superior business results for the organisation.
OUTLOOK AND PROSPECTS
Greater uncertainty is shaping the energy industry in 2020 
as the dual impact of a COVID-19-driven demand slowdown 
and oversupply in the oil market continues to unfold. As we 
release this report, the coronavirus pandemic continues to 
impact global economic activities with countries around the 
world imposing national quarantines and lockdowns, causing 
a sharp fall in global demand. 
Further strains in the global economy emerged in early March 
2020 following an oil price crash triggered by the collapse of 
the OPEC+. Dwindling storage capacities have also put further 
pressure on oil prices, with the historical plunge of WTI prices 
into negative territory in late April 2020, another indication of 
market dislocation. While we have recently seen some positive 
developments following the concerted efforts taken by the 
OPEC+ towards stabilising oil prices, the energy industry 
continues to be hard-hit by a combination of demand and 
supply shocks. 
In this period of uncertainty, PETRONAS has taken early 
measures to safeguard the well-being of our people through 
the implementation of several proactive steps to manage the 
risk of exposure and reduce the risk of transmission of the 
virus. In terms of our businesses, we are ensuring that our 
operations continue to run safely and efficiently across the 
value chain. 
We will continue to monitor the developments of these 
external events and strengthen our resiliency as well as 
future-proof the organisation to preserve our long-term 
sustainability. Our focus will be on the elements that are 
within our control which include strengthening our financial 
position, driving further efficiencies and cost optimisation 
efforts across the Group. On the back of strong fundamentals 
and a healthy cash position, PETRONAS aims to sustain 
the momentum in the execution of our strategies with the 
objective to future-proof the company. 
Above all, PETRONAS remains 
committed in delivering long-term 
value to our stakeholders by fulfilling 
the Amanah and our Statement of 
Purpose as a progressive energy and 
solutions partner enriching lives for a 
sustainable future. 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
The commendable results of PETRONAS’ performance in 2019 
is a recognition of our people whose tenacity and focus have 
steered the organisation forward even during this challenging 
time. Our brand performance has also improved to #120 in 
Brand Finance’s Top 500 Most Valuable Brands List in 2020 
and ranks as ASEAN’s most valuable brand and Top 10 Most 
Valuable Oil and Gas Brands in 2020. 
My gratitude is also extended to our Chairman, YBhg Datuk 
Ahmad Nizam Salleh and all members of the PETRONAS Board 
of Directors for their guidance and stewardship. I would also 
like to express my utmost appreciation to our shareholders for 
their support and trust, and to our business partners, vendors 
and stakeholders for their continued belief in PETRONAS as 
their preferred energy and solutions partner.
While business is expected to no longer be as usual for 
PETRONAS, I am confident that we will be able to successfully 
navigate through this period of uncertainty and emerge as a 
stronger and more resilient organisation.

REVIEW OF 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS
PETRONAS recorded lower revenue of RM240.3 billion in FY2019, a 
decrease of 4 per cent from FY2018, on the back of lower average realised 
prices for our major products. This was partially offset by higher sales 
volumes for petroleum products and LNG as well as the favourable effects of 
the weakening of Ringgit Malaysia against the US dollar exchange rate.
Our average realised prices were heavily influenced by declining key 
benchmark prices throughout FY2019. Dated Brent averaged USD64/bbl 
in FY2019 compared with USD71/bbl in FY2018. This reduction of 10 per 
cent was largely influenced by robust US crude oil production and weaker 
global oil demand. The average price for LNG benchmark, namely Japan 
spot prices, also fell by a staggering 50 per cent to USD6 per million British 
thermal unit (MMBtu) from USD12/MMBtu a year ago due to oversupply of 
LNG in the market.
In tandem with our lower revenue, Earnings Before Interest, Tax, 
Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) fell by 17 per cent to RM96.3 billion 
in FY2019 from RM116.5 billion in FY2018. The Group’s Profit After Tax (PAT) 
consequently decreased by 27 per cent to RM40.5 billion in FY2019, primarily 
attributed to lower commodity prices and net impairment on assets.
Despite the softer results, the Group was able to sustain healthy levels of 
Cash Flow From Operations (CFFO). This key metric increased by 5 per 
cent to RM90.8 billion, while Free Cash Flow (FCF) saw an increase of 9 per 
cent to RM43.0 billion from the same period in 2018. This demonstrated 
the Group’s resilience and continuing fiscal discipline and underlined our 
ability to strike a balance between sustaining the momentum for growth 
and supporting operational demand. The Group’s liquidity position also 
remained robust, attested by our discipline in fulfilling existing financing 
commitments arising from external debt obligations while preserving our 
ability to return value to our shareholders.
Commendable results demonstrated by our integrated value chain also 
helped to cushion the impact of lower prices and tightening margins. 
Operationally, Upstream production volume in 2019 grew to 2.4 million 
barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day, an increase of 2 per cent from 
2018. This was contributed by higher liquid production from international 
operations and higher natural gas production in Malaysia.
Total LNG sales volume for the year was 6 per cent higher at 30.6 million 
metric tonnes as compared with 28.9 million metric tonnes in 2018, mainly 
attributed to higher production volume from PETRONAS LNG Complex 
(PLC) in Bintulu. 
Downstream recorded an overall petrochemical production volume of 
10.4 million metric tonnes during the year. This was delivered on the 
back of strong plant performance and reliability, with assets recording an 
Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) of 90.6 per cent across all business 
segments.

FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY
PETRONAS’ financial position remained solid, with assets totalling RM622.4 billion as at 31 December 2019. Total assets 
decreased by RM13.9 billion or 2 per cent from 31 December 2018 due to a decrease in cash, funds and other investments 
resulting from dividend payments and cash paid on capital expenditures.
PETRONAS continued to invest in strengthening our business and increasing revenue generation opportunities. In FY2019, 
our spending on capital investments increased slightly to RM47.8 billion from RM46.9 billion. Of this amount, 52 per cent 
went to domestic projects, primarily for the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) project in Pengerang, Johor. International 
capital investments included the Group’s acquisition of three new exploration blocks as well as the Tartaruga Verde and 
Espadarte fields in Brazil. Other international ventures made during the year were the acquisition of Amplus Energy Solutions 
Pte Ltd (M+) and Da Vinci Group B.V., denoting the Group’s entry into the renewable energy
The Group’s return on total assets (ROTA) and return on average capital employed (ROACE) for FY2019 decreased to 8.6 per 
cent and 8.7 per cent, respectively from 11.8 per cent and 12.0 per cent in FY2018 in line with our lower profits. Our gearing ratio 
decreased to 19.4 per cent from 19.7 per cent in FY2018 mainly due to lower borrowings following the repayment of loans.

Capital Management
The Group remains steadfastly committed to financial prudence as outlined in the PETRONAS Group Corporate Financial 
Policy. The Group’s capital structure consists of consolidated equity plus debt, defined as the current and long-term portions 
of the Group’s debt.
The objective of the Group’s capital management is to always maintain an optimal capital structure and ensure the availability 
of funds to meet financial obligations, support business growth and maximise shareholders’ value. To this end, the Group 
continuously monitors and maintains a prudent level of total debt to total assets to ensure compliance with all covenants.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. 
Managing Risks 
Key financial risks that arise in the normal course of business mainly comprise credit, liquidity and market risks. These are 
explained further in our Notes to the Financial Statements as part of Note 40: Financial Instruments.
Our approach to managing risks is described in our Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control (SORMIC) on pages 150 - 157. 
REVENUE BY PRODUCT
The Group’s total revenue for FY2019 was RM240.3 billion, primarily contributed 
by petroleum products and LNG, which accounted for 36 per cent and 21 per

Revenue from exports remained as our biggest contributor, at 36 per cent of Group revenue or RM85.8 billion. Exports revenue was 
down by 13 per cent from FY2018, primarily attributed to lower prices for major products coupled with lower sales volumes.
Revenue from domestic operations recorded a consistent increase over the years primarily contributed by higher regulated prices 
for processed gas and higher term contracts for petroleum products, further supported by higher sales volume.
International operations revenue, which accounted for 31 per cent of total revenue, was down 6 per cent from FY2018, mainly due 
to lower sales volume and product prices.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019
PETROLIAM NASIONAL BERHAD (PETRONAS)
SEGMENT EARNINGS
The Group operated three core businesses in FY2019: Upstream, Downstream 
and a newly introduced business segment, Gas and New Energy, which will 
be focusing on gas and renewable energy. Corporate and Others, which 
complements our core businesses, comprises the logistics and maritime 
segment, property segment and central treasury, as well as the project 
delivery and technology function.
Upstream
Upstream contributed 55 per cent to Group PAT in FY2019, maintaining its position as the 
major contributor to the Group’s total earnings. Upstream PAT decreased by 15 per cent from 
RM26.1 billion in FY2018 to RM22.2 billion in FY2019, attributable to lower revenue and net 
impairment on assets. 
The decrease in Upstream revenue was primarily attributed to lower prices for liquid and gas, 
partially offset by the favourable effects of the weakening of Ringgit Malaysia against the US 
dollar exchange rate. Higher production volume of 2 per cent came mostly from international 
assets in support of the Group’s portfolio expansion. Domestically, gas production also 
increased as a result of production ramp-up activities. 
Gas and New Energy
Gas and New Energy recorded a PAT of RM9.8 billion in FY2019, contributing 24 per cent to 
the Group’s PAT. The lower PAT by 43 per cent compared with RM17.2 billion in FY2018 was 
mainly attributed to net impairment on assets and higher product costs.
Higher impairment losses arose from lower price outlook while higher product costs were 
seen in line with the increased number of cargoes delivered during the year. LNG sales volume 
for the year was higher by 1.7 million tonnes compared with FY2018, mainly attributed to 
higher volume from the PLC.
Downstream
Downstream PAT stood at RM5.2 billion in FY2019, lower by RM1.6 billion or 24 per cent from 
the previous year. The decrease was mainly attributed to lower petrochemical product spreads 
and refining margins. In FY2019, Downstream recorded an OEE of 90.6 per cent while plant 
reliability stood at 97.6 per cent.
Our petrochemicals business sustained its operational performance with a plant utilisation rate 
of above 90 per cent and achieved overall petrochemical production volume of 10.4 million 
metric tonnes. 
Corporate and Others
Our Corporate and Others business recorded a lower PAT of RM4.7 billion, 35 per cent less than 
FY2018’s RM7.2 billion. This was mainly due to lower gains on the disposal of investments.
MISC Berhad (MISC) and KLCC Property Holdings Berhad (KLCCP) were the two major 
contributors to this segment. MISC recorded a PAT of RM1.4 billion, mainly contributed by its 
LNG and offshore businesses. KLCCP’s PAT was RM0.9 billion, mainly contributed by property 
investment income.
Further information is provided in MISC’s and KLCCP’s 2019 annual reports.

For FY2019, the revenue forgone in respect of the regulated pricing mechanism imposed on the supply of sales gas in Peninsular 
Malaysia’s power and non-power sectors was at RM6.3 billion, compared with FY2018 of RM6.9 billion. The decrease in revenue 
forgone was mainly attributed to lower contract prices, in line with lower benchmark prices. Cumulatively, total revenue forgone 
has reached RM261.0 billion in FY2019, since regulated prices came into effect in May 1997.
OUTLOOK
The outlook for the oil and gas industry remains bearish, given the ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, prolonged trade tensions 
and near-term demand disruptions due to the COVID-19 health crisis. The Board expects the financial performance for 2020 
to be affected by these factors. However, notwithstanding these challenges, PETRONAS will continue to deliver operational 
excellence and growth strategies. 
Amid slumps in prices and demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as oversupply in the market, PETRONAS will 
continuously re-evaluate our capital expenditures as part of ongoing efforts to strengthen our resiliency in facing the greater 
uncertainty of the global markets moving forward.

HOW WE CREATE VALUE
We had a good year in portfolio growth, focusing on operational excellence while balancing 
domestic and international capital investments. Moving forward, we want to ensure a healthy 
funnel of resources and reserves to sustain our portfolio where we deploy our technology 
and capabilities on high-value activities; and tough challenges are turned into advantageous 
opportunities – all to enrich lives for a sustainable future.
Note: Unless stated otherwise, all Discovered Resources (Reserves and Contingent Resources) are reported in entitlement volume, all Undiscovered Resources (Prospective Resources) are 
reported in gross volume and International is reported in equity volume.
Replenishing Our Resources and Reserves
In ensuring sustainability of production, we continued our efforts in replenishing our 
reserves. 
• 
In 2019, we added 0.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent (bboe) of reserves, mainly through 
the sanctioning of 47 projects including the Kasawari field offshore Sarawak and the 
acquisition of the Tartaruga Verde field and Module III of the Espadarte field in Brazil. 
• 
As at 1 January 2020, PETRONAS’ total petroleum 2P reserves stood at 9.24 bboe, an 
increase of 11 per cent from 2018. This has resulted in increasing PETRONAS’ Proved 
(P90) Reserves Life Index (1P) RLI to 9.2 years from 8.1 years in 2018.
PETRONAS’ total Contingent Resources (2C) meanwhile stood at 15.08 bboe as at 1 
January 2020. This was in part the result of 11 new exploration discoveries made during the 
year which contributed approximately 0.48 bboe of 2C to our portfolio.
• 
Among the major discoveries made were the Lang Lebah field located in offshore 
Sarawak, holding approximately 4 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of natural gas (gross), one of 
the world’s top 10 largest discoveries in 2019.
We also continued to secure new exploration acreages in material basins and increased our 
Prospective Resources (2U) by 27 per cent to 10.85 bboe from 8.52 bboe in 2018.
• 
This includes the acquisition of three exploration blocks in the offshore Campos Basin 
in Brazil. Brazil is considered as one of the most prolific exploration and production 
regions within the Atlantic, with a proven petroleum system and superior reservoir 
performance. 
Overall, we continued our year-on-year improvements in reserves and acreage addition 
while expanding our portfolio to new areas such as the Americas.
ACHIEVING OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
We strive to continuously improve our processes and conduct our operations in a 
sustainable manner, through a combination of technology, digital and innovative 
solutions. In 2019, we took more deliberate steps to reduce our impact to the 
environment.
• 
We successfully relocated a wellhead platform from the Ophir field to the Jitang 
field, offshore Malaysia, by our subsidiary Vestigo Petroleum Sdn Bhd (Vestigo), in 
one piece without any further structural modifications. It was a world’s first and 
was accomplished within a record-breaking time of three days.
• 
We completed the plugging and abandonment of 28 wells in Malaysia, achieving 
40 per cent lower than benchmark cost with environmental practices in place.
 
Find out more about our Decommissioning and Abandonment actions on page 92 in the Safeguard 
the Environment section.
• 
In realising PETRONAS’ carbon commitments, we accelerated our reduction of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by reducing venting and flaring in operations. 
We have recovered 42 MMscfd as sales gas from facilities operated by PETRONAS

DIGITALISATION OF OPERATIONS
Upstream’s Digital Agenda continues to create new value while boosting operational 
and cost efficiency. More importantly, our digital initiatives are holistic, which involve 
people, processes and tools, in ensuring our people remain safe, and the business 
continues to deliver sustainable value. 
• 
We improved offshore operations and assets, digitalising them at lowered cost. 
Ninety per cent of PETRONAS Carigali’s global production (49 fields) are enabled 
on Digital Fields. Since 2017, value generated from Digital Fields exceeded 
USD200 million (RM868 million), with RM328 million generated in 2019 alone. 
• 
Meanwhile, we also strengthened the NextGen Health, Safety, Security 
and Environment (HSSE) via digital tools such as ePTW (Permit to Work) and 
Offshore/Onshore Safety Integrated System (OSIS) which allows automated 
verification and shorter processing time, contributing to 100 per cent PTW 
compliance and annual savings of RM1 million. 
• 
We leveraged collaboration across Upstream and digital tools to sustainably 
manage our petroleum resource funnel, for example wells digitalisation and the 
Upstream Project Management System (UPMS). Meanwhile, our approved FIDs 
increased by 21 per cent compared with 2018 which reflects the effectiveness of 
UPMS in promoting pace to deliver development projects.
• 
We are innovating complex Exploration and Production (E&P) data processing 
with emerging data intelligence technologies by collaborating with 
GEOGUEST, a wholly owned subsidiary of Schlumberger (SLB).
 
• 
We get everyone involved in the Digital Transformation journey by 
crowdsourcing digital solutions for operational improvements. A total of 140 
solutions were crowdsourced which improves operations and asset integrity 
via predictive analytics at a value potential of RM240 million. We also empower 
personnel with analytics at their fingertips by enabling a mobile ecosystem, for 
data-driven decision-making.
Upstream
ENSURING SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION
We continued to contribute to Maximising Cash Generators  by recording a higher 
production volume of 2.4 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day, a 2 per cent increase 
compared with 2018. This was contributed by higher liquid production from international 
operations and higher natural gas production in Malaysia. 
At the same time, 35 projects achieved first hydrocarbon in both Malaysia and international 
including countries such as Iraq, Myanmar, Republic of South Sudan, Indonesia and Argentina. 
This contributed 62 thousand boe per day of new production for the year. We continue to 
focus on harnessing technology to enhance cost efficiencies and maximising our reserves 
recovery while balancing the implementation of our medium to long-term strategies in 
ensuring sustainable production.

ACHIEVING INVESTMENT EFFICIENCY
Upstream capital expenditure (CAPEX) was higher in 2019 (RM24.3 
billion) against 2018 (RM20.5 billion) by 19 per cent, mainly contributed 
by the increase in development projects in Malaysia, coupled with 
increased activities in International operations. Among the countries 
where our international CAPEX for 2019 focused on included Iraq, Brazil, 
Canada and Argentina, countries with abundant hydrocarbon resources. 
In 2019, operating expenditure (OPEX) was RM22.3 billion, a reflection of 
the cost rationalisation efforts that we have embarked on since 2018 to 
maintain PETRONAS’ resilience and competitiveness.
CHALLENGES AND MITIGATION IN 2019
The upstream sector continues to face risks 
with the constant shift in the energy landscape, 
making it more challenging to harvest value from 
investments. We continue to plan and execute our 
Upstream activities in accordance with the requisite 
regulatory and governance requirements. We 
prioritise stakeholder management of the relevant 
authorities, partners and communities in all the 
locations that we operate in to ensure that we 
continuously conduct our business sustainably, in 
accordance with international oil and gas industry 
standards and best practices.
We remain steadfast to stay the course in 
safeguarding our people, assets, reputation and the 
environment.
OUTLOOK AND PROSPECTS
In the medium to long-term, 
the Upstream business is 
expected to face an increasingly 
challenging outlook amid low 
prices, stagnated spending, 
increased costs, depleting 
resources and production gaps 
as the shift to a low-carbon 
economy picks up pace. These 
factors are compounded by the 
global onset of the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
We will remain agile in executing our Upstream 
strategies and plans to fulfill production targets and 
deliver excellence across Exploration, Development 
and Production through best-in-class and 
disciplined execution. 
We will continue to improve our operational 
excellence and intensify our digital efforts to deliver 
energy in a cost-effective manner, at pace and with 
a lower carbon footprint. Underlying all this is our 
top priority in ensuring everyone goes home safely.

INTENSIFYING SAFETY EFFORTS BEYOND COMPLIANCE
In 2019, we reduced Major LOPC by 60 per cent and Minor LOPC by 40 
per cent. We recorded lost time injury frequency (LTIF) of 0.11 and fatal 
accident rate (FAR) of 1.01 but this was regrettably overshadowed by 
the single fatality in our Iraq operations. We continue to strive hard to 
ensure that everybody gets home safely. 
We endeavour to go beyond compliance underscored by emphasis 
on good environmental and safety practices in PETRONAS. In 2019, 
• 
We achieved 50 per cent reduction of Malaysia Asset LOPC 
through intensified efforts under Malaysia Asset LOPC Reduction 
Programme, initiated in 2016 with zero Major LOPC in 2019 as 
compared with 2018. This included thorough inspections beyond 
the current coverage of the PETRONAS Risk Based Inspection 
(PRBI). Intervention plans that included leveraging application 
of advanced inspection technology saw LOPC reduction at an 
average of 52 per cent per year since 2017.
• 
We deployed the Fatigue Management System across assets in 
Malaysia to curb non-compliance with the Hours of Service 
Limit (HSL). This also reduced the number of avoidable medical 
evacuations.
• 
We boosted safety culture across all operations through the HSE 
Recognition Programme implemented in 2019. This programme 
is designed to help create the right environment for staff to gain 
recognition for their efforts while also emphasising the utmost 
importance of compliance and understanding consequences.

HOW WE CREATE VALUE
In line with the Group’s commitment to reducing our 
impact on the environment, our strategies are designed to 
drive sustainable business growth while advocating the use 
of cleaner energy.
We contributed to Maximising Cash Generators  by 
growing LNG sales volume by 6 per cent at 30.6 million 
metric tonnes in 2019. 
• 
In Maximising Cash Generators 
, we reached 
the naming ceremony milestone for PFLNG DUA, 
our second Floating LNG facility that is set to define 
the future of LNG. The facility, which is capable of 
monetising deepwater gas up to 1,500 metres in depth 
with a production capacity of 1.5 million tonnes of 
LNG per year, is set for commercialisation by end of 
2020. 
 
Advocating the use of natural gas is a key climate action for 
PETRONAS. Find out more about our cleaner energy initiatives in 
the Safeguard the Environment section on page 85.
In 2019, LNG production for the year remained strong with 
an increment of 5 per cent to 28.1 million metric tonnes, 
a direct result of higher feed gas supply and stable plant 
performance. In 2019,
• 
PFLNG SATU, our maiden Floating LNG facility was 
successfully relocated and commissioned at the 
Kebabangan Gas Field, Sabah. The first cargo was 
achieved by June 2019, and 10 cargoes were loaded by 
end of the year. This added to the unblemished record 
of over 11,000 LNG cargoes being delivered around 
the world to date from our LNG assets.
• 
PETRONAS Gas Berhad’s 350 MW co-generation 
plant in Gebeng, Pahang is poised to supply steam 
and electricity to Polyplastic Asia Pacific Sdn Bhd for 
an extended duration of 22 years, following the sales 
agreement signed between the two parties in the 
middle part of the year.
• 
Following Malaysia’s gas market liberalisation 
and implementation of third party access, our 
Regasification Terminal (RGT) in Sungai Udang, Melaka 
received its first third party cargo, accelerating the 
move towards achieving a market-based gas pricing 
environment. 
INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR MARKET NEEDS
While we invest in existing businesses to grow revenue, we 
keep a sharp focus to meet market needs and secure strategic 
market positioning.
Thus, as a cleaner energy solutions partner, we seek 
opportunities across the value chain to deliver innovative, 
flexible and customer-centric solutions. In 2019, 
• 
We conducted four LNG ship-to-ship transfers in 
Labuan waters to serve our LNG customers' needs for 
smaller LNG parcels.
• 
We have successfully completed eight instances of 
gassing up, cooling down (GUCD) services at our RGT 
in Pengerang, Johor and Bintulu, Sarawak. to serve post 
dry-dock and warm LNG vessels.
• 
We reached the Final Investment Decision (FID) for the 
Virtual Pipeline System (VPS) facility in RGT Pengerang 
to transport LNG via trucks (ISO tanks) to off-grid 
customers located away from the main pipeline in 
Peninsular Malaysia. 
• 
Upon the successful reloading of the world's largest LNG 
Bunker Vessel at Pengerang regasification terminal in 
2018, PETRONAS continues to push the boundaries in 
providing LNG bunkering service to LNG-fuelled vessels. 
In line with this business aspiration, a Time Charter 
Party (TCP) agreement was signed with MISC Berhad 
and Avenir LNG Ltd to charter a 7,500-cubic metre LNG 
Bunkering Vessel (LBV) to provide bunkering solutions 
from middle of 2020 onwards.

ACCELERATING MOVE INTO RENEWABLE ENERGY 
As part of Stepping Out , PETRONAS is advancing in the 
energy transition by accelerating its presence in the renewable 
energy space. Our portfolio is strengthened this year with a 
bold move into solar energy. 
• 
Acquired a leading Singapore-based company, Amplus 
Energy Solutions Pte Ltd (M+), with a portfolio of 
distributed, renewable energy assets in Asia. With a total 
capacity of 600 MWp under operation and development, 
M+ is serving more than 150 commercial and industrial 
customers at over 200 locations across India, the Middle 
East and Southeast Asia. 
• 
Launched M+ by PETRONAS, the first customisable 
and affordable solar solution in Malaysia designed for 
both commercial and industrial use. This reaffirms our 
strategic intent to grow in the renewable energy space 
to future-proof the business. In addition, these efforts 
support Malaysia’s ambition to increase the proportion 
of renewable energy in Malaysia’s energy generation mix 
from 2 per cent in 2018 to 20 per cent by 2025.
 
We are adjusting our portfolio mix to include more renewable energy, 
find out more in the Safeguard the Environment section on page 86.
DIGITAL AND INTEGRATED WAYS OF WORKING
We have developed digital solutions, known as Alpha LNG, 
to provide end-to-end visibility of our LNG portfolio while 
identifying optimisation opportunities across the LNG value 
chain. We achieve this by leveraging Alpha LNG’s analytics 
and data science models, which enable us to adapt to 
market changes and make decisions at pace; to ultimately

HSSE IS OUR LICENSE TO OPERATE
In 2019, GNE recorded one Tier-1 Process Safety Event which 
resulted in major fire and major loss of primary containment 
(LOPC) and two lost time injury (LTI) incidents. These incidents 
have triggered a sense of chronic unease in managing process 
safety risks associated in our operations. Lessons learnt from 
these incidents are taken as essential input in coming up with 
our HSSE strategies and key focus areas as we move forward 
into the year 2020, aiming for Zero Fatality, Zero Major Fire, 
Zero Major LOPC and Zero LTI. We strive to achieve the latter 
through the demonstration of chronic unease coupled with 
the adoption of preventive approach in managing HSSE risks, 
focusing on three key pillars namely:
Gas and New Energy
Gas and New Energy
OUTLOOK AND PROSPECTS 
The outbreak of the coronavirus 
(COVID-19) rattled a global oil and 
gas industry that was already plagued 
by challenges such as oversupply and 
declining prices. The effects of this 
pandemic and oil price collapse are 
expected to persist throughout the 
year. Hence, in walking this tightrope, 
added vigilance is required to achieve 
progress in 2020.
CHALLENGES AND MITIGATION IN 2019 
2019 was another transformative year for the global LNG 
market. Global LNG supply increased by approximately 39 
million tonnes, sending the market into oversupply. The year 
also marked the lowest LNG spot prices in the past five years, 
plunging to a low of USD4/MMBtu.
Structural changes, a growing number of players and evolving 
business models point towards increasing commoditisation of 
the market. Closer to home, Malaysia’s market liberalisation 
to boost natural gas demand has also shifted the supply 
dynamics, allowing for a healthy competition at market-
determined prices. 
The headwinds were coupled with grand coalitions emerging 
from climate change concerns, as well as increasing pressure 
for oil and gas players to play its part in reducing global 
emissions. 
Amid all these challenges, PETRONAS remained resilient, 
securing higher LNG sales by 6 per cent and domestic gas 
sales by 4 per cent. We demonstrated greater focus on 
customer centricity through the provision of solutions for 
evolving customer needs including LNG ship-to-ship transfers 
and gassing up, cooling down services. Heeding the call for 
cleaner energy, our acquisition of M+ has established our 
presence in the renewable energy space towards becoming a 
one-stop centre for cleaner energy solutions.
Unrelenting pressure on LNG demand and prices coupled 
with excess LNG supply will test our resilience in operating 
in this environment. Despite the weak market outlook, policy 
uncertainties in the three largest LNG markets – Japan, China 
and South Korea – as well as potential growth in emerging 
markets may provide some upside to LNG demand. Backed by 
our cost-competitive supply portfolio, we continue to intensify 
our efforts to provide accessible cleaner energy to customers 
globally while at the same time progressing our projects to 
enhance reliability and security of supply for our customers.
On the domestic front, the implementation of third party 
access (TPA) in Peninsular Malaysia and market-based pricing 
for natural gas will continue to attract new suppliers, as well 
as incentivising future upstream investment. Internationally, 
PETRONAS has LNG growth projects currently ongoing in 
Canada. Together with our joint venture partners, we own 
approximately 900,000 gross acres of mineral rights with more 
than 60 trillion cubic feet of reserves and contingent resources.
Successful management of the transition towards market 
reform is critical to mitigate any threats to the efficacy of the 
liberalised market. The TPA will also strengthen long-term 
security of supply and optimise development costs and gas 
infrastructure utilisation, creating a vibrant marketplace that will 
ultimately benefit consumers.
In the renewable energy space, solar and wind will remain as 
areas with the biggest growth potential, given the continuous 
technology improvements leading to decreasing costs. We will 
continue to be vigilant in our search for innovative business 
models and in adopting new technologies. Particularly, we are 
exploring clean hybrid and storage solutions to diversify our 
renewable energy portfolio in response to evolving market 
and customer requirements. Through these ventures, we are 
able to create new revenue streams for the business that are 
cushioned from hydrocarbon price volatility and future-proof 
PETRONAS in the energy transition.

THE WAVE OF DIGITAL DISRUPTION
In an industry characterised by fluctuation and challenges, our 
business continuously pursues new methods to create value 
for the Group. We have disrupted the traditional business 
model, driving focus towards untapped opportunities that give 
us a competitive advantage.
• 
Through Project DOVE, we leverage technological 
and digital advancements to continuously reinvent 
our business with goals to support organisational 
transparency, facilitate better data-driven decision-
making, increase personal accountability and promote 
enterprise collaboration within PETRONAS.
• 
The agility in digitalisation allows us to deliver business 
value on a scale that is constantly on the move. We 
use digitalisation as a lever to achieve operational 
excellence by improving efficiency and increasing 
the performance visibility of our refineries and 
petrochemical plants, as demonstrated through our 
enterprise effort, Project PIVOT.
• 
In keeping up with ever-changing consumer demand, we 
strive to cater beyond existing products and solutions. 
Under PDB, Setel, Malaysia’s first mobile application 
of its kind, was developed to eradicate everyday pain 
points associated with the refuelling process including 
long queues, the use of physical loyalty cards and RM200 
credit card hold. This new retail experience provides a 
seamless on-the-go refuelling for PETRONAS customers. 
Today, it integrates payment and loyalty benefits into a 
single application, offering a seamless and frictionless 
experience to our customers.
• 
Beyond retail, we introduced ROVR, the first mobile 
refuelling service in Malaysia for both commercial and 
everyday drivers, which extends PDB’s coverage beyond 
the extensive network of PETRONAS stations nationwide. 
ROVR has also given PDB a competitive advantage in 
addressing challenges in existing business paradigms by 
easing logistical planning and enabling more efficient 
operations management for commercial customers. 
For everyday drivers, ROVR is available at local hotspots, 
bringing PETRONAS fuel to customers in areas with no 
nearby PETRONAS stations for their convenience.
CONTINUOUS COMMITMENT TO SAFETY
Safety has always been a top priority for the Downstream business. Execution of 
our signature campaign, “Jom Patuh & Tegur”, continues to be implemented 
across the Group. We conduct numerous Health, Safety, Security and 
Environment (HSSE)-related training and awareness programmes throughout 
the year in adopting a HSSE Generative Culture. The Downstream business saw a 
reduction in fatalities, lost time injury (LTI) and major fire incidents in 2019 
at 67 per cent, 64 per cent and 50 per cent, respectively. However, despite 
stringent supervision, we regretfully suffered one fatality in 2019.
As we continue to reinforce our zero-incident target, we need to remind 
ourselves that good HSSE practices are always a collective responsibility. Strict 
compliance with the rules and policies, coupled with a mindset that requires us 
to look out for one another, will help us achieve our HSSE goals.
CHALLENGES AND MITIGATION
Managing market and industry volatility is a given condition for all major 
players. Our integrated value chain, ranging from refining, trading and 
manufacturing to marketing, is always susceptible to these uncertainties.
In a volatile environment driven by customer demands, industry players must 
strive to drive cost reductions and productivity gains to remain competitive. As 
customers become more sophisticated, the demand to cater for their needs 
becomes more crucial than ever. As an experienced energy and solutions 
partner, we identify challenges as seen through our customers’ lens and aim 
to become the preferred partner to our customers by enriching their customer

Project Delivery and Technology
OUTLOOK AND PROSPECTS
The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about an increasing risk 
of impact towards some projects due to prolonged lockdowns and further 
disruptions anticipated to the global supply chain and industry providers. 
PD&T has put in place early measures to ensure that we continue to operate 
our total business value chain as optimally, and as safely and efficiently as 
possible. PD&T remains committed to the long-term goals of its technology 
agenda, which addresses four main themes that disrupt current patterns 
- Clean Energy, Artificial Intelligence, Hyper-Connectivity and Advanced 
Materials. PETRONAS also crowdsources innovation through the Technology 
Marketplace and by establishing collaborations and partnerships with 
universities and global research centres. Some of our plans to future-proof 
PETRONAS are already underway and are discussed below:
Facilities of the Future
Our Facilities of the Future programme leverages the use of subsea technologies, digitalisation, automation, robotics, hyper-
connectivity, artificial intelligence and machine learning to create new ways of approaching our business. The aim of the 
programme is to reduce operating expenditure (OPEX) by 50 per cent and is targeted at the main cost levers of surface 
operations, maintenance and logistics. Reducing operational cost is crucial against the backdrop of declining production 
outlook and increasing development complexity. In addition, it also tackles the need for a more efficient and skilled workforce 
while reducing HSE exposure.
This will fundamentally change the way we operate our assets (our operating philosophy) and our technical and capability 
requirements to deliver solutions for both greenfield developments and brownfield assets.
For Greenfield developments, the programme will provide 
subsea factories with technological solutions complemented by 
an onshore-based integrated command centre. This concept 
will allow for an operating philosophy that is fully unmanned 
(reducing HSE exposure) and requires zero or very minimal 
maintenance intervention (reducing operational costs). This 
approach will also help to unlock more value from marginal 
fields, shallow water and deepwater assets. 
For brownfield assets, the programme focuses on developing the 
following technologies: 
i. 
Robotics inspection, maintenance and tele-operation
ii. Renewable energy for lowering opportunity cost
iii. Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) and analytics expansion 
from current programmes
What is a Subsea Factory?
Subsea Factory is a solution to pursue growth in the Material Oil segment. Moving from the conventional way of minimal subsea 
(SPS, SURF) to total subsea factory (subsea separation, SURF, Separation, Storage, seawater injection, multiphase booster pump). 
As natural reservoir pressure declines, subsea compression can efficiently generate enough pressure to maintain production and 
manage flow-related challenges as it is located close to the reservoir.

PETRONAS' Climate Change Position
PETRONAS duly recognises its corporate responsibility as a 
player in the global energy sector to balance the issue of climate 
change with the challenge of sustainably producing affordable 
and reliable energy. 
Safeguard
the Environment
We believe that safeguarding the environment means going beyond compliance with existing 
environmental legislation. Equally important is the environmental impact our operations may 
have on society over time. Anchoring on this approach, we manage impacts across the entire 
business value chain by driving improvements in operational efficiency, innovation and the use 
of advanced technology to acquire accurate operational data. 
Concurrent to strengthening our core operations responsibly, we are Stepping Out  into the renewable energy space and 
continue to advocate natural gas and LNG as alternative low-carbon fuels. These actions will ease the shift to decarbonisation 
towards a sustainable future for society.
CLIMATE RESPONSE 
Responding to a changing climate poses both risks and opportunities for PETRONAS. As governments, societies and other 
key stakeholders around the world call for concerted climate action, it is clear that the energy industry has an important 
responsibility to take action. Some of the diverse actions taken include reducing and measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) and 
methane emissions, improving energy efficiencies in our operations, delivering low-carbon solutions to our customers and 
upholding responsible reporting practices, in line with international standards, to address stakeholder concerns.

Safeguard the Environment
PETRONAS CARBON COMMITMENTS  
The PETRONAS Carbon Commitments (PCC) were developed in 2012 to guide the management of our GHG emissions 
mainly through hydrocarbon flaring and venting reduction, and energy efficiency improvement. The PCC have since matured 
operationally, evolving with the market, and leveraging technical innovation and advanced technology. 
We enhanced the PCC in 2017 to incorporate new requirements on managing high CO2 fields, carbon price, carbon offsets 
and renewable energy. The PETRONAS Carbon Commitments Guidelines provide the business and Petroleum Agreement 
Contractors (PACs) the approach for an effective implementation of the PCC. Group Health, Safety, Security and Environment 
(GHSSE), PD&T, and Upstream, GNE and Downstream businesses oversee the incorporation of the PCC requirements in both 
domestic and international business systems and processes where relevant.
The PCC drive climate actions in reducing 
GHG emissions in our operations 
and projects, as well as in investing in 
renewable energy, while creating value 
and strengthening our businesses. We 
identify, assess and prioritise climate risks 
that could impact our business operations 
and subsequently integrate them into the 
PETRONAS Enterprise Risk Management 
profile for Groupwide implementation. To 
manage potential exposure arising from 
carbon liability, we focus on understanding 
emerging legislation in relation to climate 
change; and to add value, we ensure 
adequate and suitable technologies, such as 
CCUS, are developed at the right time.
Promoting Natural Gas as a Low-Carbon Fuel
We believe we can deliver clean and low-carbon energy with the use of natural gas and LNG as an alternative to high-carbon fossil 
fuels to limit rising temperatures. Deploying advanced technologies, such as CCUS, helps to ensure sustainable extraction and 
processing of natural gas and LNG as we continue to expand our Gas business portfolio in our energy transition journey.
Minimising Flaring
PETRONAS designs projects to have zero continuous flaring and reduced continuous flaring by monetising the hydrocarbon gas for 
existing facilities where feasible. 
We strive to minimise flaring by improving gas compressor availability and reliability and enhancing plant processes to reduce 
low-pressure flare gas. In 2019, we reduced 1.2 million tonnes of CO2e GHG emissions from vent to flare conversion at an oilfield 
offshore Sarawak, bringing the amount of emission reduction to 12.8 million tonnes of CO2e since 2012.
PFLNG DUA
PETRONAS marked another milestone in 
contributing to cleaner energy solutions 
by naming its second floating LNG facility 
in South Korea. Built in South Korea 
through collaborations with Samsung 
Heavy Industries and JGC Corporation, 
PFLNG DUA is moored at the Rotan Gas 
Field at a water depth of 1,300 metres, 
located 140 km offshore Kota Kinabalu, 
Sabah. The 393-metre-long floating 
LNG facility is able to produce 1.5 million 
tonnes of LNG per annum. 
Safeguard the Environment
Climate Actions 
PETRONAS carried out various climate actions in our operations to deliver clean and low-carbon energy to our customers 
through key projects that deliver high value.
Improving Energy Efficiency in Our Operations
Continuous efforts in Downstream have improved energy utilisation via the Energy and Loss Management System (ELMS) and 
ameliorated OEE, which have increased plant utilisation rate from 85.2 in 2018 to 90.6 in 2019 and subsequently reduced 
Downstream GHG emissions.
For Upstream, PETRONAS Energy Canada Ltd has 
implemented an initiative to reduce its overall GHG emissions 
footprint through the electrification of its newly built 
production facilities in the Town North b-89-J gas plant in 
British Columbia. PETRONAS Canada decided on using co-
generation which generates electricity and useful heat at the 
same time. The expected capital expenditure on the project 
is CAD48 million and it is expected to be completed by the 
first quarter of 2020. It will reduce GHG emissions by about 
37,000 tonnes of CO2e annually. The implementation of new 
technologies to reduce GHG emissions in the life cycle of our 
operations is critical to achieve regulatory compliance, allow 
for business growth, and maintain and continue to strengthen 
our reputation with key stakeholders, indigenous peoples, the 
government and the public.

A Continuous Journey of Methane Reduction
Renewable Energy Solutions 
PETRONAS generates clean electricity sourced from five key installations, namely:
Energy generated at these sites will potentially reduce GHG emissions by 713,000 tonnes of CO2e, which is equivalent to planting 
133,000 trees or powering 290 households. In addition, it translates to cost savings of 20 to 40 per cent for electricity bills at these 
sites.
Project SINARAN (Solar Installation and Application on PETRONAS Rooftops and Assets Nationwide) continues this journey with 
a potential of 22.5 MWp of installed capacity. A total of 183 sites over 13 operating units have been identified as being suitable for 
the installation of grid-connected solar PV systems to harvest the sun’s energy. Once completed, the project will reduce our total 
electricity consumption by 2.2 per cent. This will contribute to a reduction in GHG emissions of 24,281 tonnes of CO2e per annum. 
As of 2019, we have installed solar capacity worth 893 kW under Project SINARAN at seven sites.

Delivering Fuel Efficiency in our Products
We are constantly improving our products to be more fuel-efficient. The new PETRONAS Primax 95 with Pro-Drive and our flagship PETRONAS Syntium with 
°CoolTech™️ are examples of this. Read more about our efforts in the Downstream business section on page 71.
Managing hydrocarbon venting reduces methane emissions. The initiative at one of Sarawak’s platforms started in 2017 with the 
upgrading and recommissioning of a low-pressure compressor to recover approximately 20MMscfd of vented hydrocarbon gas. This 
has reduced 0.8 million tonnes of CO2e since implementation. Complying with the PCC aspiration of zero continuous hydrocarbon 
venting, a vent to flare conversion project was commissioned in 2019 that further reduced emissions by 1.2 million tonnes of CO2e. We 
completed a situational assessment in 2019 that resulted in improvements to quantification and governance practices.
Safeguard the Environment
Enhancing GHG Monitoring, Reporting and Verification
We continue to improve GHG monitoring, reporting and verification to strengthen GHG data accuracy and stakeholder confidence 
through:
• 
Digitalisation programme – We created a centralised data repository and upgraded existing software, which will increase 
transparency and advance our aspiration for automated GHG calculations, i.e. meter to report.
• 
Internal verification – Internal verification was completed in 2019 at Malaysia LNG (MLNG), following earlier completion in the 
Downstream, and Gas and New Energy businesses.
• 
External GHG verification contracting (2020 to 2022 plan) – External GHG verification contracting was initiated in 2019 and 
is planned to be completed in 2022. The scope includes domestic and International PETRONAS operations with operational 
control.
Climate Change Capability Development
• 
In 2019, a technical competency ruler was established to develop Competent Climate Change Persons for a cohort of 
PETRONAS employees across the business.
• 
Selected Change Persons were upskilled with capabilities in GHG monitoring, reporting and verification for operations and 
projects, as well as forest-based carbon offset and climate change adaptation training.
• 
Vulnerability assessments, upskilling training sessions and workshops were conducted to increase understanding on the 
vulnerability and exposure of our operations, assets, people and surrounding communities to climate hazards.
Conserving our Forests for Carbon Sequestration
For more information please refer to Positive Social Impact on pages 94 - 116. 
We are currently exploring opportunities to use natural forest-based carbon sinks that will sequester CO2 from the atmosphere. In 
2019, we conducted training sessions and workshops on forest-based carbon offsets. We also hosted the first oil and gas industry 
carbon offset workshop in Kuala Lumpur, organised by the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association 
(IPIECA).
Moving forward, our Malaysian operations in Upstream, Downstream, and Gas and New Energy will continue to be the 
primary focus for mitigation initiatives as they contribute to the majority of PETRONAS’ GHG emissions.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
We continue to embed environmental management in our operations as we brace for more challenging and stringent 
environmental expectations from our stakeholders. To reduce our environmental footprint, we focus on improving the design 
of our facilities, sustaining operational excellence and streamlining internal processes. 
We place high priority on ensuring compliance with applicable environmental regulations in a sustained manner. Internal 
environmental standards and guidelines have been established for Groupwide implementation and benchmarked against 
international standards such as the World Bank guidelines and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance 
Standards on Environment and Social Sustainability. For example, operations of the Pengerang Integrated Complex are 
aligned with the IFC Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability and the applicable World Bank Group/
IFC Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines.
In addition, our staff are trained to become Environment Specialists working with other technical skills groups to achieve the 
common goal of environmental sustainability in our business.
Waste Management
In 2019, we generated approximately 274,000 metric tonnes of hazardous waste as compared with 112,000 metric tonnes in 
2018. The increase was due to tank cleaning maintenance activities resulting in the generation of oily sludge. The total waste 
recycled or recovered was 66,000 metric tonnes, equivalent to 24 per cent of total waste generated.  
Moving forward, we have identified waste minimisation as a metric, based on the application of the circular economy
concept, towards a 2024 target. This will be carried out in collaboration with the Malaysian Government on the New Plastic 
Economy initiative. 
Rethink Plastics – Towards a Circular Economy 
With the increase in human population, the demand for plastic increases, resulting in the need 
for good waste management and improved infrastructure to manage plastic waste. Studies have 
indicated that by 2050, there will be more plastic than fish in the sea, thus making it imperative for 
us to look at how we can create value by turning plastic into a resource. 
In our efforts to change the mindset from viewing “plastic as waste” to “plastic as a resource", our 
subsidiary, PCG collaborates with the Malaysian Government in addressing plastic pollution in the 
country. PCG is spearheading the New Plastic Economy initiative, Malaysia’s Roadmap Towards 
Zero Single-Use Plastics 2018-2030. We are working with internal and external stakeholders 
from government agencies, industry players and local communities to realise the success of this 
programme. 
Based on Malaysia’s existing waste management framework, gaps were identified leading to the formulation of four pillars: 
INNOVATION
To apply advanced recycling 
technologies to convert 
plastic waste that cannot be 
recycled using conventional 
methods.
EDUCATION
To impart knowledge on 
how we can continue to 
benefit from the versatility 
of plastic without damaging 
the environment by adopting 
proper waste management 
practices. 
INFRASTRUCTURE
To develop effective and 
sustainable waste recovery 
systems.
CLEAN-UP
To turn education into 
action through hands-on 
clean-up activities within 
communities.

INNOVATION
We inked a collaboration with Plastic Energy Ltd to look into technology development to process non-recyclable plastic 
waste into crude naphtha. The crude naphtha produced will then be fed as alternative feedstock for the production of 
recycled virgin-quality polymers. The aim of the collaboration is to build a chemical recycling plant with the capacity 
to process 25,000 tonnes per annum of plastic waste to naphtha, the first of its kind in Southeast Asia. PCG is working 
closely with plastic converters as well as brand owners to close the loop in ensuring that recycled virgin-quality polymers 
produced from this process will benefit the industry and reduce plastic waste leakages to the environment.
INFRASTRUCTURE
In addressing the existing gap in recyclable materials recovery, we are collaborating with Cypark Resources Berhad 
(Cypark) to develop a Solid Waste Modular Advanced Recovery and Treatment (SMART) system for municipal waste. 
Through the system, mixed waste will be sorted into types at a semi-automatic facility. The recyclable materials 
recovered from this facility will then be processed to create more value instead of ending up in landfills. Plastic collected 
from this system will be channelled into the most appropriate facilities for treatment and reprocessing prior to being fed 
back into the circular economy.
CLEAN-UP
To complement our educational programmes and expand our reach to the community, we have enhanced our signature 
CSR programme, Be Green, to include talks on plastic waste management and community clean-up activities. In 2019, 
we incorporated the 3R (reduce, reuse, recycle) elements in Be Green via a nationwide #recycleforlifecycle campaign, 
with the objective of inculcating a culture of 3R and waste segregation. We target to recover plastic waste volume equal 
to our production volume of polymers for the Malaysian market by 2030, and to redirect this waste into the circular 
economy.
EDUCATION
We collaborated with the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Malaysian Plastics Manufacturers Association (MPMA) and 
Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Corporation (SWCorp) to develop an educational module for primary and secondary 
schools on the sustainable use of plastic.
The “Plastic, Sustainability and You” module has been developed for teachers to supplement their Science, Additional 
Science, Chemistry, Geography and Sustainability subjects. It emphasises that everyone has a role to play in reducing 
global warming and marine litter, which negatively impact environmental sustainability, by managing waste responsibly. 
The content is available in Malay, English, Mandarin and Tamil, and is complemented by videos and interactive learning 
modules to make learning more fun and interesting.

Water Management
Water is crucal to our business, especially to the Downstream business that utilises approximately 90 per cent of our total 
freshwater withdrawal. Water is mainly used for cooling and generation of steam for manufacturing purposes. Any disruption 
to this essential resource will affect our operations; thus, we have adopted robust internal standards and policies, as well as 
initiatives, to optimise our water consumption.
In 2019, we optimised water consumption and minimised water wastage following the completion of a Groupwide water 
balance exercise, the continuing review of water practices (WAPS) activities and water stress screening using the World Resource 
Institute’s (WRI) Aqueduct Water Stress Atlas for locations where we operate.
Freshwater Withdrawal 
In 2019, our total freshwater withdrawal was 58.33 million cubic metres from Malaysian and international operations, which was 
comparable with the 59.21 million cubic metres recorded in 2018.
Wastewater Discharge
Our wastewater is treated before being released into the environment. The oil in water content decreased from 715 metric tonnes 
in 2018 to 634 metric tonnes in 2019 due to lower operational activities.
Air Emissions
We continue to evaluate risks and monitor air emissions from our facilities. To expedite the interventions required, we have 
developed online monitoring of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and carbon monoxide to enhance data 
visibility. We work closely with relevant stakeholders to streamline an integrated air emission management approach.
Sulphur oxides emissions in 2019 stood at 93,948 metric tonnes compared with 113,256 metric tonnes in 2018. The decrease in 
emission value was mainly due to the usage of cleaner fuel (low-sulphur compliant fuel) in our fleets.
Nitrogen oxides emissions in 2019 stood at 151,445 metric tonnes compared with 151,519 metric tonnes in 2018. The slight 
decrease in emission value was due to operational improvements and a reduction in venting activities.
Our water management initiatives are not just about managing water withdrawal and 
consumption in our business operations. They include contributing to communities 
through water-related activities. 
Since 2013, our “Water For Life” programme, initiated by PETRONAS Dagangan 
Berhad and carried out in partnership with the Malaysian Nature Society, has 
provided rural villages with sustainable clean water supply. Close to 9,000 people 
have benefitted from the programme, which has garnered support from about 900 
volunteers across the country. In 2019, the programme was brought to Kampung 
Kubang Tok Lebai (Sik, Kedah) and Kampung Kuala Pangsun (Hulu Langat, Selangor). 
The work typically involves building water infrastructure to enable clean water supply 
to the communities, as well as awareness programmes to educate the communities 
on water conservation and health risks associated with unclean water consumption. 
Since 2013, 
"Water for Life" has rallied

Oil Spills and Response Preparedness
Our preventive maintenance and routine monitoring have prevented spills at source and maintained our facilities’ reliability. We 
recorded a total of seven hydrocarbon spills in 2019 with a total estimated volume of 24.9 cubic metres, which was similar to the 
seven spills recorded in 2018 (22.6 cubic metres).
Spill incidents due to land transportation accidents (three out of eight) continued to be minimal in 2019. The small number of 
accidents was the result of intensified road safety campaigns and the enforcement of our Road Transport Operation Guideline 
(RTOG). Our RTOG comprises continuous development of drivers’ competencies, structured procedures, work and rest 
hours (WRH) monitoring, driver behaviour monitoring and journey management plans (JMP). Based on the campaigns and 
enforcement, we achieved a 60 per cent reduction in speeding violations and a 26 per cent improvement in our in-vehicle 
monitoring system (IVMS) violations per million kilometres as compared with 2018.
In 2019, our Oil Spill Management under the Crisis and Incident Management Department continued to strengthen 
PETRONAS’ oil spill response (OSR) capabilities. Two OSR quantitative risk analyses were completed for PETRONAS Carigali
Turkmenistan Operations (PCTO) and PFLNG SATU, respectively and one OSR equipment assessment for PCTO. 
Intensifying organisational OSR capability is also done through upskilling and training. In 2019, there were a total of eight training 
sessions conducted. This included four sessions for the Upskilling of the Emergency Management Team (EMT), three sessions for 
the Training of the Oil Spill Response Team (OSRT) and one session of OSR Awareness involving 158 personnel.
To strengthen collaboration regarding oil spill matters, an OSR Technical Forum was conducted in October 2019 with MPM. The 
forum saw the participation of 82 OSR stakeholders representing the industry, oil spill response service providers as well as the 
authorities. It also provided a strategic avenue for the sharing of relevant OSR information such as the mechanism for responding 
to wildlife affected by oil spills and the tiered preparedness and response wheel.
Decommissioning
PETRONAS has been in operation for 46 years and it has been more than 100 years since oil production activities began in 
Malaysia. Thus, we expect to see a marked increase in decommissioning and abandonment activities given that some assets 
have reached or are reaching the end of their life cycles. In 2019, we endorsed six integrated decommissioning projects and over 
20 well plugs and abandonments. We estimate the abandonment liability of our current assets to be around RM60 billion. This 
estimate has the potential to rise to over RM100 billion if the abandonment or decommissioning process is not managed well. 
As part of the decommissioning options assessment, we emphasise evaluating feasible options in reusing the facility’s material to 
support the growth of marine life and provide protection from illegal trawling activities. This entails detailed social and economic 
analysis on refurbishing retired oil and gas structures into artificial reefs, and we work closely with the Department of Fisheries 
(DOF) Malaysia. In 2019, we established a Reefing Framework with the DOF for future artificial reef collaboration as a result of 
decommissioning works.
We have benchmarked against and collaborated with other stakeholders, as well as local and foreign players, to ensure we have 
instituted the best practices, especially to mitigate our impact on the environment. PETRONAS collaborated with the Department 
of Environment (DOE) Malaysia to develop a national-level “Environmental Guideline for Decommissioning of Oil and Gas Facilities 
in Malaysia”.

Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (BES) is the goods and services ecosystem provided for human well-being and economic 
development. Large-scale development can impact BES and create material risk for the industry. PETRONAS recognises that any 
disruptions to BES in our areas of operations can potentially affect the quality and availability of BES to the local communities as 
well as our operations. Conserving and maintaining the ecosystems are important for both the present and future generations, 
and further supported by fostering and enhancing relationships with the local authorities and communities. 
In 2019, we undertook the following initiatives to promote biodiversity conservation:
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Risk Assessment (BESRA) for three of our operations namely Malaysian Refining Company 
Sdn Bhd (MRCSB), Sabah Gas Terminal (SBGAST) and Engen, identified potential BES risks and recommended mitigation measures 
for all three sites.

Fatigue Management 
The Fatigue Management System (FMS), which digitally tracks 
and monitors hours of service limits (HSL) – working hours, 
days and rest periods based on work groups, now covers 55 
assets in Malaysia. The pilot rollout to offshore assets was 
also successfully completed in 2019 and determined to be 
feasible for rollout to offshore assets, depending on risk and 
priority factors. In 2020, we will be leveraging digitalisation 
to strengthen fatigue management in land transport with 
the integration of the Fatigue Management System into the 
In-Vehicle Monitoring System. This will enable real-time 
monitoring to allow us to intervene before an occurrence of 
non-compliance.
Along with the integration of FMS in land transport, to improve 
management of the risk of fatigue among land transport drivers, 
we proceeded to develop and implement the Fatigue Remedy 
and Sleep Hygiene (FReSH) module. FReSH is a train-the-trainer 
module focusing on training land transport contractors to 
get enough sleep and serves as a proactive measure towards 
preventing and reducing fatigue among drivers. Training was 
conducted for 60 trainers from eight land transport contractors 
and the training was subsequently delivered to 711 contractor 
drivers in Malaysia. We are currently engaging with the Engen 
fleet team with a plan to commence FReSH in 2020.
Industrial Hygiene
Effective management of industrial hygiene remains a focus 
for PETRONAS. In 2019, we worked to reduce usage of 
and exposure to chemicals of very high concern (CVHC), 
minimised and controlled exposure to noise and hazardous 
chemicals and ensure implementation of human factors 
engineering in projects.
The initiatives implemented by Noise Improvement Control 
and Engineering (NICE) Taskforce achieved a significant 
noise reduction of up to 27dB(A) (a 99.8 per cent reduction) 
from identified sources within our operations in Sarawak and 
two locations in Terengganu. Up to 56 per cent of identified 
high-risk asbestos-containing material were removed or 
further controlled to lower risk. In addition, the top three most 
frequently used CVHC were identified for substitution. 
Environmental Health
We continuously safeguard community health by adopting 
a risk-based approach that addresses potential cumulative 
health impacts. In 2019, we conducted human health risk 
assessments at selected Malaysian Operations facilities. The 
assessment findings will strengthen the decision-making 
process for future risk-based mitigations.
Positive Social Impact
SAFETY
We protect our employees and contractors by ensuring an uncompromising 
approach to providing a safe and healthy work environment. Compliance with 
stringent regulatory requirements including governance over safe work processes are 
imposed and adhered to. We believe our strong safety mindset has led to more than 
50 per cent reduction in the FAR in our operations for 2019.
Riding the 
Digital Wave - 
myHSSE
As we move towards operating in an increasingly complex environment, we have strengthened our digital and 
analytics capacities. In 2019, we improved operational data sharing and knowledge from analytics in seeking ways 
to increase efficiency and standardisation across the stakeholders we serve. As of 2019, Group Health, Safety, 
Security and Environment (GHSSE) has embarked on 10 different digital platforms and work processes to improve 
HSSE performance across PETRONAS’ domestic and international operations. 
By navigating a centralised platform of myHSSE, we aim to simplify user experience on our systems for both staff 
and contractors. This centralisation allows all users to gain instinctive knowledge of how to record, track and 
monitor HSSE reporting. myHSSE also provides solutions that can integrate HSSE considerations into improving 
users’ yields and operations.
GHSSE also benefits from the massive amount of data inputs for improvements and to build progressive analytics 
solutions. Ultimately, these tools protect the rights of our workers and will improve HSSE key performance 
indicators across business units to ensure that each and every worker in PETRONAS goes home safely.
The real-world applications of digitalisation in the HSSE context include improvement in work productivity, where 
time taken to process employee medical assessments in SHIELD had reduced to 95 per cent. The simplification of 
methods to report Unsafe Act Unsafe Condition (UAUC) has also increased the number of immediate actions taken 
to eliminate incidents at the work place. Through the FMS, more than 20,000 potential fatigue-related incidents 
have been avoided as any employee or contractor who exceeds the hours of service limits (HSL) will not be allowed 
to enter PETRONAS premises. 
57% reduction in 
fatal accident rate (FAR) 
as compared with 2018
The PETRONAS Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Policy reflects our commitment to ensuring the safety of our people, 
assets and the environment. The PETRONAS HSE Policy ensures every person in the areas where we operate does the right 
thing, every time. Prudent due diligence is carried out where risk assessment findings, including intervention plans, are 
deliberated regularly at our Board Audit Committee and Board Risk meetings for continuous improvement.
Safety in PETRONAS covers personal safety, contractor management, land transport operations and process safety. 
Continuous improvements on safety is a norm in our operations and new safety initiatives are introduced to maintain positive 
safety impact.
Food Poisoning Intervention
Food poisoning incidents remain a major contributor to 
occupational illnesses. As such, we continued our efforts 
towards improving food safety management across all our 
assets. This involved conducting three catering workshops 
involving a total of 82 contractor caterers where we 
reinforced food safety requirements and jointly agreed that 
the caterers would obtain food hygiene certification, i.e. 
BeSS (Clean, Safe and Healthy) recognition, from the health 
authorities. As at end-2019, 67 per cent of the caterers have 
obtained BeSS. BeSS is a form of recognition given to food 
premises operators by the Ministry of Health Malaysia to 
encourage the provision of safe and healthy food.
Moving forward, assessments have been scheduled with the 
target of achieving 100 per cent BeSS certifications by the end 
of 2020.

Process Safety
Our process safety efforts revolve around early prevention 
and mitigation of Major Process Safety Events, which include 
loss of primary containment (LOPC), fire and injury (loss time 
injury) to avoid the significant impact when they occur. 
We are vigilant in managing risks by embedding the aspects 
of Process Safety in our HSE Management System and 
PETRONAS Technical Standards. Our Process Safety Loss of 
Primary Containment Reduction (PSLR) Framework and the 
Fire Prevention and Mitigation Framework (FPMF) work in 
tandem to prevent and mitigate Process Safety Events. These 
frameworks, introduced in 2017 and 2018 respectively, signify 
our focused intent on tackling LOPC and fire risks. Our efforts 
have shown encouraging results, whereby the number of Tier 
1 Process Safety Events (PSE) was reduced by about 42 per 
cent from 12 in 2017 to seven in 2019. 
In addition to the frameworks, we also prioritise the 
monitoring and reporting of leading indicators, which enable 
us to address potential risks proactively. This is in line with best 
industry practices promoted by international organisations 
such as the Centre for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS), of 
which PETRONAS is a member company.

Shaping Generative HSSE Culture
In 2019, we extended the Culture Maturity Survey to our international assets. With a 78 per cent response rate, comprising 
respondents from across the Group, the results showed PETRONAS is progressing towards a “Generative” HSSE culture, 
indicating HSSE is embedded in how we do business in PETRONAS. Our efforts to shape Generative HSSE Culture focused on 
behavioural change by reinforcing the culture of accountability, HSSE leadership development and effective communication. 
In the year under review, we have trained a total of 96 leaders inclusive of top leaders and middle managers. Additionally, we 
also upskilled 308 frontline supervisors with the relevant capabilities to accelerate our HSSE journey. Moving forward, we will 
continue to amplify our efforts to upskill and train more leaders and frontliners as our change agents in shaping PETRONAS’ 
Generative HSSE culture towards a sustainable HSSE performance. 
Crisis and Incident Management
Effective crisis and incident management is crucial to the business continuity of PETRONAS in the locations where we operate. 
The aim is to keep our people safe and businesses running, as we move from a reactive to a proactive approach. 
With the integration of crisis and incident management into our HSE Management System (HSE MS) and Mandatory Control 
Framework (MCF), PETRONAS has built a strong foundation with the appropriate governing procedures for continuous 
improvements. Our framework takes into account lessons learnt from incident investigations. Real-life cases have impressed 
upon us the need to have a coordinated response and preparedness with the right interventions and controls to minimise the 
fallout from any incident.
We have in place a three-tiered response system Groupwide that provides a clear demarcation of roles and responsibilities for 
emergency site management, operating unit management, our corporate office and the authorities. 
Our facilities and assets conduct scheduled emergency drills and exercises to ensure readiness in an emergency or crisis. In 
addition, PETRONAS Management's readiness to manage emergencies and crises is also assessed at the corporate level.
Positive Social Impact
Initiatives of Crisis and Incident Management
• The Incorporation of Centralised Emergency and Fire Services (CEFS) BINTULU
 The establishment of CEFS BINTULU provides centralised services and a pool of resources to respond to any major incident such 
as tank fire, major chemical release, oil spill or mass casualties given the nature of the business operations in the Bintulu industrial 
area. This single-source managed solution, combined with full turnout of skilled manpower, equipment and vehicles, has delivered 
better coverage of incidents and more effective management of cross-boundary incidents, as well as provide value-added services 
related to firefighting training and equipment maintenance to its members.
• Poly-and Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Chemical Utilisation in Emergency Responses
 PFAS are a family of man-made chemicals known and used for extinguishing fires effectively via firefighting foams that effectively 
reduce the combustion of liquid hydrocarbons. However, there is concern that their firefighting ability should be balanced with 
safety, performance, cost and environmental considerations as PFAS are known to be very persistent in the environment, and can 
be harmful to humans. To this end, PETRONAS has established a guideline on the screening of foams, their handling, storage and 
use, waste and wastewater management and other measures relevant to the use of firefighting foams in order to manage the risks 
accordingly.
• Incident Management System (IMS) - Tripod Beta Practitioners
 In 2019, PETRONAS accelerated its development of Groupwide Incident Investigators under the Tripod Beta programme. More than 
10 upskilling sessions were conducted in 2019, with one conducted specially for HSSE Senior Management on Human Factors in 
Tripod Beta. As of end-2019, PETRONAS has certified more than 160 Tripodeans, classified as Bronze, Silver and Gold Practitioners. 
Our goal is to conduct structured and effective incident investigations, which should ultimately reduce incident recurrence by 
identifying their causes and recommending solutions.
• Oil Spill Management
 In November 2019, the National Oil Spill Contingency Plan (NOSCP) Review Committee Meeting, chaired by the Department of 
Environment, agreed with PETRONAS’ proposal to include the Oiled Wildlife Response Management mechanism as part of the 
NOSCP. The Department of Environment entrusted PETRONAS with the task of drafting the Oiled Wildlife Response Management 
mechanism for implementation at national level.
• Emergency Preparedness and Response (EPR) Malaysian Standard
 PETRONAS is one of the committee members that established the Malaysian Standard for Emergency Preparedness and Response. 
The Department of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH) and Department of Standards Malaysia (JSM) have agreed to adopt 90 
per cent of PETRONAS’ requirements in the new Malaysian Standard for EPR.
• PETRONAS’ Contributions in Response to the Sungai Kim Kim, Pasir Gudang, Pollution Incident
 In March 2019, PETRONAS was called upon by the MESTECC to provide technical assistance and support. PETRONAS provided 
technical and strategic advice on gas monitoring and surveillance, including equipment, small and medium enterprises, and 
consequence modelling. We are part of a Technical Committee assisting the Malaysian Government in gas monitoring of 
surrounding areas as well as in consequence modelling by consolidating gas-monitoring data.
• Ex-Siaga 5
 Ex-Siaga is a building-evacuation exercise for PETRONAS Twin Towers to test the effectiveness of our current building-evacuation 
protocols and business continuity. This year’s participation rate was the highest since the exercise was first conducted in 2013. 
About 10,037 tenants participated, which was a 63 per cent increase over the previous exercise. 2019 was also the first time a radio-
frequency identification (RFID) system was used for Headcount Management, which showed an effectiveness rate of 94 per cent.
• Towards Digitalisation - Crisis Management Information System (CMIS)
 PETRONAS has improved its CMIS by utilising its very own enterprise geographic information system (GIS) framework, PiriGIS. 
CMIS is a set of digital tools that helps to facilitate responder and management decision-making during emergencies or crises. 
Responders will be able to select tactical and strategic responses that include a Firefighting Foam Calculator, Spill Impact 
Mitigation Assessment (SIMA) and Shoreline Cleanup Assessment Techniques (SCAT). 
 The first phase, launched in first quarter 2019, consisted of a Common Operating Picture based on the IPIECA model for 
integrated response with our web-based Emergency Log System (ELS). ELS is an online integrated system that allows live and 
simultaneous data entry from multiple emergency and crisis teams. It provides navigation to other application systems such as 
the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI), which involves all of PETRONAS’ facilities including storage tanks, as well as police 
stations, fire stations and hospitals.

SECURITY
PETRONAS is working towards safeguarding our people, information, property and operations wherever we operate. Our holistic 
approach entails continuous assessment on the availability, adequacy, reliability and effectiveness of existing security controls. In 
doing so, we are mainly guided by laws and regulations as well as PETRONAS Security Policy and Security Management System 
(SeMS). 
In the period under review, we placed a stronger emphasis on physical and security preparedness. The intent was to proactively 
address current and emerging security threats.
Security Governance and Assurance 
We conducted the Asset Classification Exercise (ACE) across various asset types globally to enforce stricter compliance levels 
with the PETRONAS Mandatory Minimum Security Standards. In 2019, we have identified assets with higher risk security 
exposure and ensured its security compliance levels meets our established requirement. 
We are also on track in the upgrading works for the PETRONAS SeMS for seamless reporting between Security and HSE, 
following inclusions of security related matters in PETRONAS Technical Standards on HSSE Reporting and conduct Integrated 
Assurance Programme (IAP) for continuous improvements.
Positive Social Impact
Proactive Risk Management 
We carry out security risk assessments for our onshore, offshore and maritime operations. This includes providing tailored 
insights on the adequacy of available security controls and mechanisms. Findings from such assessments are used in the 
development of additional security controls and to facilitate informed business decision-making. For example, we upgraded 
our security passes for our Malaysian operations in 2019. The RFID technology was a proactive step to protect the security of 
encrypted information, while further tightening our physical controls to prevent unauthoritised accessibility into our assets. 
Another key highlight in 2019 was the large-scale table-top security preparedness exercise alongside the relevant Malaysian 
enforcement authorities and government agencies in preparation for PFLNG DUA sail-away to Malaysia.
In the period under review, we expanded our scope to include internal periodic security forecasting and analysis. The effort 
enabled timely decision-making, deployment of security resources and enhancements in upholding uninterrupted business 
activities. In this regard, efforts to further strengthen our capabilities in the area of security data analytics are in the pipeline. 
Security Compliance Culture 
At PETRONAS, we adopt the concept that “Security is Everyone’s Responsibility”. We continue to emphasise the importance of 
individual accountability in mitigating security risks through various security awareness and communications initiatives. In 2019, 
we focused on raising security consciousness among staff on general security best practices and common security oversights 
at the workplace. Targeted security awareness programmes were also executed during the festive and holiday seasons, during 
which our staff participated in a Group-led campaign - “Jom Patuh dan Tegur”.
A notable achievement in the period under review was the successful execution of our Security Day, themed “Empowering 
Women: Protect Yourself from Attacks”. The event, held at the PETRONAS Twin Towers in Malaysia, was aimed at inculcating 
the right security behaviours and civic consciousness among our female fraternity towards shaping a safe, secure and agile 
workforce. The event emphasised crime motivation factors from a criminological perspective and included practical physical 
self-defence tips.
Stakeholder Engagements
We view the pursuit of knowledge and skills as imperatives to enhance the competitiveness of our security controls as well 
as management practices. In 2019, we further accelerated our engagements with our local and international stakeholders, 
comprising local enforcement and government agencies, including our peers from the energy sector. These engagements 
focused on collaboration avenues to leverage shared resources and expertise, including discussions on emerging security risks 
impacting our industry. This essentially led to improved response times and measures to prevent untoward security occurrences, 
as well as the identification of feasible avenues for converging our existing physical and digital security solutions, among others.
In 2019, PETRONAS organised a Security Community of Practice, titled “Drone – Friend or Foe”, on 11 September in Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia. The engagements and sharing centred on mitigating the consequences of the unauthorised use of drones on the oil and 
gas industry’s operations, given their wide accessibility, affordability and applicability. The event saw the participation of PETRONAS 
security practitioners from across the Group, local regulatory authorities and government agencies, as well as representatives from 
international oil companies.
Subsequent to this event, PETRONAS led a joint roundtable discussion in December 2019 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia 
involving identified external stakeholders. The event was a cornerstone of comprehensive deliberation on the emerging 
security threats posed by drones to the Malaysian energy sector. Several strategic solutions were formulated, with 
implementation targeted in 2020.

Graduate Employability Enhancement Scheme (GEES) 
This soft skills training programme introduced by PETRONAS is in support of the Professional Training and Education for Growing 
Entrepreneurs (PROTÉGÉ) programme, an effort initiated by the Malaysian Government to enhance young Malaysian graduates' 
employability and boost the nation's human capital development.
In 2019, 200 graduates were accepted to the programme as apprentices and began with a two-month long classroom training, 
while 150 from the previous intake underwent a six-month on-the-job training at various PETRONAS operating units across 
Malaysia. The programme was further enhanced with the introduction of two new modules related to entrepreneurship and 
environmental sustainability and social impact.
A total of 1,040 graduates have benefitted from this programme from 2011 to 2019, with 85 per cent of the apprentices gaining 
employment.
Vocational Institution Sponsorship and Training Assistance (VISTA)
This initiative helps prepare vocational institutions for the development of technical and vocational capabilities in Malaysia. 
Assistance ranges from infrastructure, equipment, trainers and programmes, including collaborations with government agencies 
for identified programmmes in welding, gas pipe fitting, chargemen, scaffolding, building maintenance, oil and gas related 
engineering modules.
To date, 28 institutions have benefitted from this programme since 1992, with 17 institutions that are currently active.
Improving Employability
It is important to PETRONAS that the employability of our sponsored students are enhanced, which will contribute to having 
a sustainable talent pool especially for technical positions. We carry out two key programmes to address this – the Graduate 
Employability Enhancement Scheme and Vocational Institution Sponsorship and Training Assistance.
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
PETRONAS operates its business based on a strong foundation of merit and equality, irrespective of gender, age, nationality, 
ethnicity, educational background and religion. Diversity brings together different strengths and experiences that encourage 
and motivate talents to deliver, backed by a high-performance culture. Our talent composition is 80 per cent Malaysian 
and 20 per cent non-Malaysian from more than 100 nationalities, all united by a common purpose and intent on delivering 
superior business results. 
PETRONAS Leading Women Network (PLWN)
As part of our diversity and inclusion agenda, PETRONAS strives to 
nurture strong female leadership and career development among 
the female workforce within the organisation. In 2015, PETRONAS 
set up the PETRONAS Leading Women Network (PLWN), a platform 
for women to grow through leadership programmes and support 
for each other. Led by PETRONAS Vice President of Exploration, 
Emeliana Rice-Oxley, PLWN organises engagement sessions 
internally and externally, including a mentoring programme to 
empower women in the oil and gas industry.
Following a survey that outlined the feasibility of creating value 
through gender diversity, PLWN rolled out gender bias awareness 
sessions for middle and senior managers by conducting workshops 
on gender diversity and inclusive leadership, gender bias training 
and bias-free performance evaluation. For instance, PLWN 
created “Tips on Removing Bias” cards as guides in performance 
appraisals, discussions and assessments, which received positive 
feedback from both male and female colleagues. To ensure a 
conducive working environment for women, PLWN successfully 
championed for the provision of safety coveralls specially designed 
for women in 2019. Prior to this PLWN initiaitive, women had to 
wear coveralls that catered for men, which were ill-fitting and 
inefficient in providing them protection. PLWN, which is also part 
of the Malaysian Women in Energy (MyWie) advocacy group, hopes 
to be the advocate of policy changes that enable equal growth 
opportunities within the organisation.

adherence to the PETRONAS COCHR.
Good practices were observed in main 
contractors for foreign and migrant workers 
with direct hiring to minimise risk of exposure 
to forced labour.
Contractors’ capability to manage human 
rights issues, in the context of the COCHR 
principles, needs to be improved. These 
principles include freedom of labour, 
grievance mechanisms, non-discrimination 
and oversight on subcontractors and 
manpower agencies.

Surveyed 873 contractors with 
active contracts on the PETRONAS 
Contractors Code of Conduct on 
Human Rights (COCHR), with a 75 per

Social Performance
Labour and Supply Chain
Supply chain management is critical for PETRONAS to function optimally in Upstream petroleum 
exploration, development, production and abandonment activities, as well as in Downstream 
product manufacturing and distribution.
By optimising our supply chain management, we can increase competitiveness and customer satisfaction and ultimately, 
increase productivity and maximise profit margins. We continuously empower local contractors and ensure their sustainability 
in moving into a more challenging digital and technological environment. By doing so, we strengthen the OGSE ecosystem and 
increase the competitiveness and capability of contractors.
SUPPLY CHAIN*
In 2019, PETRONAS awarded over RM5.7 
billion worth of projects to more than 58 
contractors of goods and services in Malaysia 
alone. Optimal management of our supply 
chain is critical for PETRONAS to gain a 
competitive advantage across its various 
business activities in Upstream, Downstream 
and manufacturing, production and 
distribution. By gaining this advantage, we will 
be maximising revenue opportunities while 
also increasing efficiency. The Group strives 
to involve local vendors and contractors as 
much as possible, and in 2019, 92 per cent of 
operations activities were awarded to local 
contractors in Malaysia.
At the same time, we take great care in 
ensuring that suppliers, wherever we operate, 
meet our high safety expectations and 
technical and environmental requirements, 
as well as strictly observe human rights 
obligations. This essentially involves the 
concept of stewardship, which means the 
Group takes the lead in implementing best 
practices across our entire supply chain and 
all the products we deliver.
HUMAN RIGHTS IN SUPPLY CHAIN
PETRONAS recognises that our contractors and suppliers contribute 
towards economic growth for the benefit of society. This is in line with our 
Sustainability Agenda to create positive social impacts, which includes a 
focus on United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 8 – Decent Work and 
Economic Growth. 
Our approach to suppliers and contractors is clearly established in the COCHR. 
The COCHR was initiated to develop a supply chain that respects the rights 
of workers, while creating opportunities for development, consistent with 
PETRONAS’ Human Rights Commitment. The focus in 2019 was to assess our 
compliance with the COCHR to identify potential risks in the areas of supply 
chain and good practices, as well as areas for improvement.
In order to establish a baseline on COCHR compliance, we leverage 
technology to enable digital self-assessments by contractors and suppliers on 
matters pertaining to labour and human rights, with an encouraging response 
rate of 75 per cent.

PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP
Product stewardship manages HSE risks throughout the life cycle of a product. In addition to complying with regulatory 
requirements, we are enhancing our supply chain due diligence in raw materials procurement, expanding our product life cycle 
assessments (LCAs), and supporting an international chemical management policy framework through the following initiatives: 
In addition, face-to-face engagements were conducted with 70 per cent of our contractors and suppliers who were in the 
elevated risk category due to the value of the contracts, the high-risk nature of the work, the remote locations where the work was 
conducted and the hiring of third party labour. The engagements were used to discuss the results of the self-assessment, as well as 
issues and risks in their procurement processes. 
Overall, suppliers and contractors were able to comply with the COCHR. Areas for improvement identified were subcontractor 
assessments and the effective implementation of contractor grievance mechanisms. A total of 29 engagement sessions on 
human rights were also conducted with contractors to ensure they understood the importance of complying with the COCHR.
Moving forward, the Group plans to complete assessments for the next tier of contractors and to include this annual self-
assessment for contractors in Group Procurement’s processes for contractors.
Positive Social Impact
We rolled out the Raw Material 
Information Request (RAWMIR) 
initiative, starting with Engen, which 
requires vendors to furnish additional 
information on supplied chemicals 
beyond the information in safety data 
sheets. This is one of the early steps 
in a larger strategic goal to achieve 
complete supply chain mapping of our 
raw materials throughout PETRONAS. 
This process will help leverage raw 
material intelligence from our supply 
chain to ultimately facilitate the phasing 
out of Substances of Very High Concern 
(SVHC) in our products and to alleviate 
the usage of Conflict Minerals.
Product LCA provides an environmental 
footprint, which enhances PETRONAS’ 
product brand value. In 2019, LCAs 
were conducted for PETRONAS 
Gas Berhad (PGB) and PETRONAS 
Chemicals Group (PCG) products. 
Moving forward, we are expanding LCAs 
to selected Upstream, Downstream 
and GNE products to evaluate the 
environmental performance associated 
with a product across its life cycle.
As part of our continuous support of 
the Strategic Approach to International 
Chemicals Management (SAICM) 
2020 goals, we have completed and 
published Global Product Strategy 
Safety (GPSS) summaries on the 
International Council of Chemical

Other Sentuhan Ilmu Programmes:
Program BUDI-PETRONAS
Program BUDI-PETRONAS is a sponsorship programme in collaboration with Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA) since 2015. More than 
600 selected underprivileged students from six Maktab Rendah Sains MARA (MRSMs) within Sabah and Sarawak have benefitted from 
this programme, which aims to instill learning interest among underprivileged students and motivate them to achieve academic 
excellence specifically in STEM. The students receive an annual education allowance that consists of school uniforms, sports 
apparel, learning aids and other basic necessities.
Trust School Programme
The intent of this programme is to drive sustainable school transformation, focusing on excellence and holistic student outcomes, 
in line with the aspirations of the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2013-2025. PETRONAS, in collaboration with Yayasan AMIR, is driving 
the implementation of a five-year school transformation programme that began in 2015 at 20 selected public schools within Sabah, 
Sarawak and Terengganu. 
The Kimanis cluster and Lundu cluster in Sabah and Sarawak, respectively are in their fourth year now and have shown an 
improvement in the implementation of transformation culture. The schools are headed in the right direction to implement the 
school transformation programme on their own. The Kijal cluster and Marang cluster in Terengganu are in the third year of the 
programme and have also shown healthy and stable improvement.
Transforming English in Terengganu (TRENGLISH) 
PETRONAS works hand-in-hand with the State Government of Terengganu to enhance English proficiency skills among the local 
students. TRENGLISH, which has impacted 40 secondary schools and 10 primary schools since 2015, includes initiatives such as 
English camps, circulation of magazines, newspaper insertions and TRENGLISH activities in schools. 
Back to School Programme
Yayasan PETRONAS enriched the lives of 21,000 primary school 
students from the B40 segment nationwide. Held from October to 
December 2019, the programme helped to alleviate the burden of 
B40 parents, motivated students to stay in school and promoted the 
importance of education among the students. This was in line with 
the MOE’s aim of reducing the school dropout rate from 0.29 per 
cent in 2017 to 0.27 per cent in 2019. 
How Yayasan PETRONAS helped: 
Each student received a back-to-school starter kit worth RM250 
comprising two pairs of school uniforms, one pair of black shoes, one 
pair of socks, a school bag, a stationery set, a tumbler and a poncho
PETRONAS Counsellors Programme (PCP)

includes implementation of environmental 
awareness and community enhancement 
programmes.
Collaboration with Cancer Research Malaysia (CRM)
Yayasan PETRONAS has pledged RM8 million to Cancer Research Malaysia 
(CRM) to support cutting-edge research in hereditary cancers among 
Asians. Yayasan PETRONAS believes that social progress must be inclusive. 
A community cannot sustain socio-economic growth if its people are 
encumbered with a debilitating disease such as cancer. It is said, “prevention 
is better than cure.” Thus, continuous research on cancer will benefit millions 
of Malaysians suffering from the disease. Recently, Cancer Research Malaysia 
senior researchers have won the Newton Fund Impact Scheme (NFIS) from the 
Medical Research Council (UK) and MIGHT (Malaysian Industry-Government 
Group for High Technology) for their work aimed at accelerating the discovery 
of new cancer medicines in oral cancer. NFIS is delivered by the British Council 
in partnership with UK Research and Innovation on behalf of all Newton Fund 
delivery partners. We hope that the partnership with CRM will continue to 
place Malaysia in the global spotlight for cancer research as it opens the door 
for more collaboration with global top scientists, while it nurtures the next 
generation of Malaysian cancer researchers.
Sentuhan Kasih Festive
Yayasan PETRONAS organises memorable celebrations for the less fortunate 
during festive seasons to bring joy and love via the Sentuhan Kasih programme 
in conjunction with key festivities in Malaysia, i.e. Chinese New Year, Hari Raya 
Aidilfitri, Gawai, Kaamatan, Deepavali and Christmas. The initiative has benefitted 
4,000 individuals and households comprising underprivileged students, single 
mothers, old folks and orphans. The Sentuhan Kasih Yayasan PETRONAS 
programme is part of the foundation’s community well-being and development 
focus area, initiated to coincide with major celebrations in Malaysia. It provides

2019 IN REVIEW
ECONOMY
The global economy experienced a 
synchronised slowdown, with global GDP 
growth at 2.9 per cent — its slowest pace 
since the 2008/2009 global financial crisis. 
Growth was weakened by trade barriers and 
increased geopolitical tensions. Populism 
and protectionism became more entrenched. 
The increased policy uncertainties weighed 
on economic and trade activities, and also 
energy demand. A sharp deterioration in 
manufacturing activities and global trade along 
with higher tariffs had crippled investments 
and demand for capital goods. 
Growth was also slowed by country-specific 
factors in several emerging market economies, 
particularly India, Argentina and Turkey, and 
by structural forces, such as low productivity 
growth and ageing demographics in advanced 
economies.
UPSTREAM
Upstream spending, including expenditure 
on LNG development, rose for a fourth year 
although the level was still way below the 
peak seen in 2014 amid greater price volatility 
and uncertainty. Exploration and production 
spending was led by North America, Brazil, 
the North Sea and the Middle East. These are 
areas with large proven reserves, making them 
more attractive for development because of 
economies of scale. Costs did not rise as fast 
as expected, prompting project developers to 
lock in contracts with oilfield service providers.
LNG
For LNG, the year had the largest amount of 
project sanctioning, as developers aimed to 
take advantage of the need for new volume by 
2023/2024. A total of 71 mtpa of LNG projects 
achieved Final Investment Decision (FID). 
About half of these were from the US, tapping 
the large shale gas resources. Other projects 
included Russia’s Arctic LNG-2, the largest 
LNG development sanctioned during the 
year, at almost 20 mtpa, and also the 13-mtpa 
Mozambique LNG. A rush of supply, especially 
from Australia and the US, flooded the market, 
pushing Asian LNG spot prices to a three-
year low in August 2019. Global LNG demand 
reached 350 mtpa. China’s consumption grew 
slower than expected and the nation was only 
behind Japan in LNG imports, at about 60 
mtpa.
DOWNSTREAM
Dated Brent averaged USD64 a barrel in 2019, 
10 per cent lower compared with 2018. Price 
volatility increased, with Brent fluctuating 
between USD53 in early January and a year-
high of USD75 in mid-May before ending 
the year at USD67, supported by heightened 
geopolitical tension in the Middle East and 
OPEC+ measures to cut production. Price 
gains were capped by robust US crude oil 
production and weaker demand.
The oil market remained oversupplied with 
commercial inventories in the Organisation 
for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) countries surpassing the five-year 
average of 2.8 billion barrels, despite the 
OPEC+ production cut of 1.2 million barrels 
per day (bpd) that started in January 2020. 
Positive Social Impact
ecoCare
ecoCare, another conservation initiative that is driven by PCG in collaboration 
with the Malaysian Nature Society (MNS) was established in 2005. Being the 
first environmental education centre in the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, it 
promotes awareness on the importance of mangrove ecosystems in the protection 
of biodiversity as well as coastal terrain. Through ecoCare, we engage with local 
community volunteers in carrying out conservation and rehabilitation activities, and 
also employ members of the local community to operate the centre.
In 2019, more than 6,300 mangrove 
trees and seedlings were planted, while 
the ecoCare Environmental Education 
Centre (EEC) attracted more than 4,000 
visitors.
PCG Be Green
PCG Be Green is an annual environmental conservation 
and plastics usage awareness programme conducted since 
2013 promoting 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). This year, 
PCG collaborated with Yayasan PETRONAS to enhance the 
programme and introduced the #recycleforlifecycle awareness 
campaign and clean-up programme. The key objective 
of PCG Be Green is to educate the community through 
regular workshops and talks on proper waste collection and 
segregation, and keeping the area clean through 3R education. 
The programme also focuses on anti-littering as well as the 
benefits and impacts of plastic usage on the environment. 
In 2019, these initiatives reached out to more than 2,700 
participants and volunteers. In addition, the programme aims 
to raise awareness on preserving clean rivers as a raw water 
source. Sungai Langat marks the first location for clean-up 
activities, followed by Kertih, Bintulu and Kuantan. The clean-up 
of Sungai Langat will be carried out in phases over five years.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019
PETROLIAM NASIONAL BERHAD (PETRONAS)
Oil demand increased by 0.8 million bpd to 100 million bpd, 
the smallest gain since 2011 due to a weaker global economic 
environment and the escalation of the US-China trade conflict. 
US production climbed to a record 12.3 million bpd in April 
2019, which led to the nation overtaking Russia and Saudi 
Arabia in total oil output.
PETROCHEMICALS
Prices for ethylene, the major building block for 
petrochemicals, declined by almost 30 per cent in Southeast 
Asia in 2019 from a year earlier. Prices touched a 10-year 
low on ample supply and lacklustre demand due to China’s 
growth deceleration and the US-China trade tension. A weaker 
economic environment, reflected in slowing activities in the 
construction and auto sectors, has dampened demand for 
packaging, auto parts and construction materials. This led to 
slower ethylene demand. The market was also affected by rising 
supply. Global capacity increased by more than 5 mtpa, a 3 per 
cent gain, of which 80 per cent came from the US and China. 
The issue of sustainability gained traction and petrochemical 
industry players gradually adopted more advanced technology 
to reduce and reuse plastic waste. 
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT
Global primary energy demand in 2019 grew by a marginally 
smaller amount than the 2.3 per cent recorded a year 
earlier. The growth was led by North America, as well as by 
developing countries in Asia and Africa, offsetting deceleration 
Market Landscape
in developed countries. Renewables growth outpaced that of 
fossil fuels amid the global expansion of large-scale solar and 
wind projects. A greater push for climate action is prompting 
oil and gas companies to expand into new energy and pursue 
renewables, especially in power and utilities.
2020 OUTLOOK
ECONOMY
The global economy is expected to contract sharply in 2020. 
There are considerable uncertainties especially when major 
economies such as the US, Japan and China are expected to 
slow further into 2020 amid the COVID-19 outbreak which has 
spread to countries beyond China. The pandemic has caused 
significant disruptions to international economies, weakening 
demand for oil and leading to a decline in oil prices that began 
in January 2020. 
UPSTREAM
Upstream spending is forecasted to fall below USD400 
billion in 2020. The sector’s focus will be on lowest cost and 
large resources as crude oil price volatility is driven higher 
by increased geopolitical tension and higher output. Focus 
areas in exploration and production will still be the large 
acreages off Brazil and deepwater developments in the Gulf 
of Mexico. 
The global economy 
is expected to register 
growth below 3 per 
cent in 2020 amid the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
Market Landscape
LNG
The trend of project sanctioning in the LNG industry is seen 
slowing in 2020 after oil and gas prices plunged, driving 
companies to reduce spending. While slowing economic 
growth will sap demand in larger markets, countries such as 
China and India are still being depended on to purchase LNG in 
their quest for cleaner burning fuels. Europe, with its domestic 
supply shrinking, is also seen importing more LNG. Overall, 
demand for LNG is growing at a faster rate than natural gas 
because of higher demand for LNG to be sent from supply 
centres to key demand areas that lack pipeline connectivity. 
DOWNSTREAM
A combination of global demand erosion from COVID-19 and 
rising supply from OPEC+ will put downward pressure on oil 
prices. Greater oil price volatility is expected to persist in 2020. 
High supply from OPEC+ and other non-OPEC countries, 
especially the US, Norway, Brazil, Guyana and Canada, will put 
significant strain on the oil market in 2020.
PETROCHEMICALS
Petrochemical product prices and margins are expected to 
continue to be under pressure amid feeble demand on the 
back of a weakening global economic environment that is 
exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Global consumption 
of ethylene is expected to grow, albeit at a slower pace while 
ethylene capacity is projected to increase, of which 90 per 
cent of growth is seen coming from Asia-Pacific and North 
America. Weaker demand and robust capacity additions could 
squeeze margins, forcing chemical companies to explore 
ways to mitigate the challenges by rationalising their product 
portfolios. 
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT
Global primary energy demand is anticipated to increase at 
a slower pace on the back of higher energy efficiency in the 
industrial, residential and commercial market segments. In the 
longer term, cost reductions in renewables and advances in 
digital technologies will continue to open up opportunities for 
energy transitions while creating some new energy security 
dilemmas. Solar will remain attractive to most countries with 
offshore also taking off. Decarbonisation efforts will continue, 
enabled by a proliferation of large scale renewables power 
auction, particularly in China and India. Energy storage will be a 
core component for many renewables power projects and the 
speed at which battery costs decline will be a critical variable 
for power markets as well as for electric cars.

Stakeholders
WHAT STAKEHOLDERS MEAN TO PETRONAS
Stakeholders are any individuals or organisations who may affect or can be affected by PETRONAS’ business activities. 
PETRONAS’ continued success as a progressive energy and solutions partner depends on the support of our stakeholders and our 
responsiveness to their needs and concerns. We continue to devote significant attention to engaging with our broad and diverse 
range of stakeholders, who have varied perceptions and expectations of PETRONAS.
PETRONAS strives to establish close relationships with our stakeholders through meaningful engagement with them. We 
believe authenticity and trust help nurture these relationships. We build on this by taking time to understand the needs, and 
interests of our stakeholders, and more importantly, by responding to them in a timely and appropriate manner.
Engaging with Stakeholders
As part of the value creation process, PETRONAS understands the concerns of our diverse base of stakeholders and responds 
to these concerns through a collaborative approach to build trust, gain recognition and earn stakeholder advocacy. Forming a 
mutual understanding that we are all in this together in partnership with each other is our principle for business sustainability. Our 
stakeholders’ concerns, interests and needs are received through various forms and channels and are diligently monitored and 
followed through. The frequency of the engagements varies. 
Below, we discuss the key concerns of our stakeholders, how we respond, and how we impact each other.
COMMON AREAS OF INTEREST FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS:

HOW WE IDENTIFY OUR KEY STAKEHOLDERS
Over the years, PETRONAS’ operating footprint has expanded substantially across many stakeholder groups, internally and 
externally. The range of key stakeholders in areas where we operate, together with their multiple, sometimes competing, needs 
and interests, are thoroughly considered and appraised. In order to understand our stakeholders and build positive and meaningful 
partnerships with them, PETRONAS has a Stakeholder Management Process that is adopted across the Group to ensure a strategic, 
forward-looking and coordinated approach to identifying and managing our stakeholders.
Under the Stakeholder Management Process, key stakeholder groups are identified based on their relevance to PETRONAS. We 
then determine the importance of a stakeholder via the significance of their influence. The current state of these relationships are 
also considered to help determine the engagement approach, which enables stakeholder management to be more proactive and 
targeted. The identification process is dynamic as we continue to recognise emerging and newer groups.

PETROLIAM NASIONAL BERHAD (PETRONAS)
Continued Value 
Creation
Our Six Capitals drive our integrated value chain, providing the basis for all aspects of the business.
HUMAN CAPITAL
Our employees are a key component 
that enables PETRONAS to successfully 
conduct its business. We have more than 
47,000 employees worldwide comprising 
a diverse range of nationalities and 
skillsets. PETRONAS takes great 
care to ensure our employees are 
constantly engaged through meaningful 
programmes that look after their 
wellness, safety and the upgrading of 
their skills.
MANUFACTURED CAPITAL
Our business relies heavily on the 
construction or procurement of 
various assets which include platforms, 
terminals, pipelines, floaters and vessels. 
In the Downstream segment, we build 
petrochemical plants and refineries, as 
well as retail stations. In Gas and New 
Energy, our LNG assets include Malaysia 
LNG, the PFLNG SATU and PFLNG DUA, 
regasification terminals and the recently 
acquired Amplus Energy Solutions Pte Ltd 
(M+), a solar energy company.
NATURAL CAPITAL
This is the core capital of our business. 
It consists of the hydrocarbons that 
we extract, and the air, water and 
energy that we use to convert it into 
products. PETRONAS invests heavily to 
ensure optimal usage of these precious 
resources, and that we mitigate our 
impact on the climate and environment 
as much as is feasible. The Group 
has robust frameworks and policies 
in place to address both climate and 
environmental concerns.
Continued Value Creation
Our business model considers the diverse businesses we operate and how we 
overcome the multitude of challenges inherent in the oil and gas industry, as we 
strive to be a progressive energy and solutions partner in all the locations with our 
presence. This integrated business model, which is driven by our Six Capitals, is 
further bolstered by good corporate governance, and robust risk and safety practices 
to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders.
EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
Finding new oil and gas resources is the primary and critical concern 
for PETRONAS as it allows us to replenish our portfolio and opens up 
new opportunities to grow our business. We then invest further into 
developing fields and constructing platforms, wells and pipelines which 
will enable the extraction of hydrocarbon. 
PROCESSING
We liquefy and process gas at our plants, and 
produce a range of petroleum products at 
our refineries. Our integrated petrochemical 
plants are well equipped with advanced 
infrastructures that will increase our product 
output ranging from high value polymers to 
specialty chemicals.

ensure our social license to operate. 
PETRONAS contributes generously to 
various communities through three pillars 
– Education, Community Well-Being and 
Development, and Environment.
INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL
To ensure PETRONAS remains efficient, 
competitive and sustainable requires the 
deployment of resources to constantly 
innovate and improve our processes. 
Leveraging digitalisation and technology 
has helped us to achieve this, and we see 
encouraging prospects in this area going 
forward.
FINANCIAL CAPITAL
Financial Capital has an interdependent 
relationship with all other Capitals. In 
order to unlock value from the other 
Capitals, we need to invest financial 
resources. The value derived from the 
operations of the other Capitals will add 
value to our Financial Capital over time. 
To derive more value from this Capital, 
PETRONAS is continuously implementing

ANNUAL REPORT 2019
PETROLIAM NASIONAL BERHAD (PETRONAS)
As an integrated energy company, PETRONAS is exposed to various risks that are particular 
to its Upstream, Downstream, and Gas and New Energy businesses. Additionally, our 
operating environment can have an impact on our business, financial condition, results of 
operations, prospects as well as reputation. 
PETRONAS has in place an ongoing process for managing significant risks. This process includes identifying, evaluating, managing 
and monitoring these risks. Risk management and its ongoing improvement in strengthening the review and monitoring of these 
risks remain a key focus of the Board in building a successful and sustainable business.
 
For each of our identified material risks, we have controls in place to minimise the exposure and impact of the risk. The approach 
and strategy in managing material risks are described in our Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control (SORMIC), which 
is available on pages 150 - 157 of this report. 
 
Our business is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These and other risks, whether known or 
unknown, may have a material adverse impact on our business. The risks set out below are linked to our Three-Pronged Growth 
Strategy and are not an exhaustive list of the challenges that we currently face or may develop in the future. The order in which 
these risks and uncertainties appear does not necessarily reflect the likelihood of their occurrence or the relative magnitude of their 
potential material adverse impact on our business.
RISK
CONTEXT 
RISK #1: 
MARKET RISK 
Our financial performance 
is impacted by the 
fluctuation in prices of 
crude oil and natural 
gas, change of customer 
preferences, exchange 
rate fluctuations, and the 
general macroeconomic 
outlook.
Risks Linked to 
Creating Value
PETRONAS’ ability to maintain and develop its business and revenues will be affected by crude oil and natural 
gas prices which are at present, expected to continue to be volatile and are subject to a variety of factors 
beyond PETRONAS’ control. Changes in crude oil and natural gas prices may also have an impact on gas and 
petrochemical prices, which typically tend to lag feedstock price changes. Prolonged periods of low oil and 
gas prices could result in projects being delayed, deferred or cancelled, impairment of certain assets and the 
viability of projects may be affected. 
 
PETRONAS also faces significant competition in the development of innovative products and solutions, 
including the development of new technologies for its core Upstream, Downstream, and Gas and New Energy 
businesses. In addition, other competitive sources of energy are expected to come into operation in the future. 
The rapid development of unconventional and alternative energy resources will create competition for the 
conventional energy industry. 
Changes in the US dollar to the Ringgit Malaysia exchange rate could have an adverse impact on PETRONAS’ 
results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as a global company present in many countries, 
PETRONAS is also exposed to changes in the value of other currencies.
 
The effects of weak global and domestic economic conditions could lead to reduced demand or lower 
prices for crude oil, natural gas and related products including petrochemicals. Economic factors such as 
unemployment, inflation and the unavailability of credit could also have a material adverse impact on the 
demand for energy.
We have in place processes and initiatives to minimise the impact of this risk. Further information on the 
control efforts can be found in our SORMIC.
Risks Linked to Creating Value
RISK
CONTEXT 
RISK #2: 
FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY RISK
Our business activities 
require significant capital 
expenditures, sufficient 
operating cash flow and/or 
sufficient external financing 
to maintain or increase oil 
and gas reserves, both in 
Malaysia and internationally. 
Reductions in PETRONAS’ income as well as the inability to obtain financing during times of global or regional 
financing challenges may limit PETRONAS’ ability to make capital investments. In addition, a global or regional 
financial crisis and unfavourable credit and market conditions may negatively affect PETRONAS’ liquidity, 
customers, businesses, and results of operations.
Our liquidity position is monitored and reviewed regularly to limit the impact of this risk. More of these 
details can be found in our SORMIC.
RISK #3: 
EXECUTION RISK 
Our business, financial 
condition and results of 
operations are dependent 
on the successful delivery 
of complex, long-term, 
capital-intensive projects, 
as well as asset portfolio 
optimisation. Consequently, 
insufficient insurance 
coverage could have 
material adverse impact on 
PETRONAS’ fiscal bottom 
line.
The success of PETRONAS’ Upstream, Downstream, and Gas and New Energy businesses depends on the 
successful execution of projects. This requires a high degree of project management expertise and skilled 
employees.
PETRONAS seeks to optimise the value of its portfolio of assets, which include assets that it holds directly 
and its interests in subsidiaries. Optimisation efforts might entail divestments of assets and sales of shares, 
which could result in PETRONAS being exposed to additional risks or liabilities, place additional demands on 
management time and other resources, or the transactions may not be successful due to market conditions or 
other execution challenges.
PETRONAS has in place insurance policies covering some of these risks, including exploration, development, 
production, project, equipment, distribution, transportation and storage risks. These policies may not fully 
cover all liabilities, and insurance may not be available for all risks or on commercially reasonable terms.
Our key internal controls address this risk. For further information on these controls, please refer to our 
SORMIC.
RISK #4: 
LEGAL AND REGULATORY 
RISK
Changes in the regulatory 
environment and rising 
climate change concerns 
could increase the cost of 
compliance, reduce demand 
for our products, affect 
our provisions and limit 
our access to new growth 
opportunities. Additionally, 
inherent uncertainty of 
litigation proceedings 
could have material adverse 
impact on PETRONAS’ 
business operations.
PETRONAS is subject to critical laws and regulations such as international sanctions, antitrust, anti-bribery, 
anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and data protection laws that carry significant fines and expose 
PETRONAS and/or its employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits. 
PETRONAS is exposed to various claims, suits and legal proceedings that arise from time to time that could 
involve shareholder, labour, intellectual property, tax and other matters. Disputes and legal proceedings that 
PETRONAS may be involved in are often subject to many uncertainties beyond our control and have outcomes 
that are difficult to predict. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation and dispute resolution process, the 
resolution of any particular legal proceeding or dispute may have a material adverse impact on PETRONAS’ 
business operations, future cash flow and results of operations or financial condition. 
In addition, PETRONAS faces various environmental laws and regulations governing land use, air emissions, 
discharges to waters, waste materials, and decommissioning and abandonment of installations, in 
connection with the design and operation of its Upstream and Downstream oil and gas facilities in Malaysia 
and in its countries of operations. The stricter enforcement or interpretation of existing environmental 
laws and regulations are often difficult and costly to comply with and carry substantial penalties for non-
compliance.
Concerns regarding chemicals and plastics, including their safe usage and potential impact to the 
environment, have led to more restrictive regulations or new regulations, which could result in delays or 
failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals. This could also lead to increased costs related to 
complying with more restrictive regulations, delayed product launches, lack of market acceptance, lower sales 
volumes or discontinuance of chemicals or plastics products.
 
PETRONAS expects continued and increased attention to climate change from all facets of society. This 
attention has led, and PETRONAS expects it to continue to lead, to additional regulations designed to reduce 
GHG emissions. These and other measures to limit GHG emissions could result in lower demand for many 
of PETRONAS’ products, which could lead to lower revenue and in the long-term, potential impairment of 
certain assets. 
Our Governance, Compliance and Legal frameworks, along with our continued efforts in implementing 
sustainability agenda are expected to reduce the impact of these risks. The ways we mitigate these risks 
can be found throughout this report and in our SORMIC.

RISK #5: 
GEOPOLITICAL RISK
Our businesses, in 
Malaysia and globally, are 
exposed to a wide range 
of political, legal and fiscal 
developments, which could 
lead to changes to the 
operating and regulatory 
environment. 
PETRONAS operates in numerous countries which have differing degrees of political, legal and fiscal stability. 
This exposes us to a wide range of political developments that could result in changes to contractual terms, 
laws and regulations. 
PETRONAS' global business activities are also subjected to regulations and directives of national and host 
governments with respect to matters such as limitations on production volumes and exports, pricing 
policies, environmental protection controls and possible nationalisation of assets, expropriation and 
cancellation of rights. Governments may intervene directly or indirectly in PETRONAS’ commercial and 
operational affairs, which would have a material adverse impact on PETRONAS. Consequently, disputes 
involving ongoing maritime boundaries delimitation in Malaysia could affect PETRONAS' offshore operations 
and explorations activities.
Governance, Compliance and Legal frameworks as well as our internal control environment assist to 
mitigate these concerns. More details of our efforts in this regard can be found in our SORMIC.
RISK #6: 
HEALTH, SAFETY, SECURITY 
AND ENVIRONMENT (HSSE) 
RISK
Exposure to a wide range 
of health, safety, security 
threats and environmental 
risks could cause harm to 
people, the environment 
and our social assets as 
well as result in regulatory 
action, legal liability, 
business interruption, 
increased costs and 
damage to our reputation, 
potentially affecting our 
social licence to operate.
The occurrence of any incidents connected with production, processing and transporting of PETRONAS’ 
products could result in injury or loss of life, environmental damage, resulting in containment, clean-up 
and repair expenses, equipment damage and damage to PETRONAS’ facilities. A shutdown of the affected 
facilities could disrupt PETRONAS’ production and significantly increase its production costs.
Malaysia and other countries have experienced, or may experience, outbreaks of viruses, various forms of 
influenza or any other communicable diseases that could result in a widespread health crisis. The COVID-19 
pandemic, for example, caused significant disruptions to international economies, as well as financial and 
oil markets, and affected global consumer demand. The lockdown and restricted movement orders due to 
the pandemic could also impact abilities of PETRONAS and its suppliers to adequately staff their respective 
operations, thus disrupting the supply chains and distribution networks for PETRONAS’ products where 
customers are based.
The security threats that could adversely impact our business include acts of terrorism against PETRONAS’ 
production and exploration facilities, offices, pipelines, means of transportation or computer systems, or 
breaches of PETRONAS’ security systems. Failure to manage these risks could result in injury or loss of life, 
damage to or the destruction of wells and production facilities, ships, pipelines and other properties, as well 
as the environment. 
Our Health, Safety and Security practices, along with our compliance and internal control on 
Environment help mitigate these risks. More details can be found throughout this report and in our 
SORMIC.
RISK
CONTEXT 
RISK #7: 
RESERVES AND RESOURCES 
RISK
The level of PETRONAS’ 
oil and gas reserves, 
resources and production 
may decline over time. 
The level of our reserves 
depends on successful 
discovery and development 
of commercially exploitable 
oil and gas reserves and 
resources as well as the 
reliability of discovered 
resource estimation. 
Future oil and gas production will depend on our access to new reserves and resources through exploration, 
negotiations with relevant parties and acquisitions, as well as on developing and applying new technologies to 
existing fields. Failure to replace existing reserves could result in lower future production, potentially having a 
material adverse impact on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. 
PETRONAS’ crude oil and natural gas discovered resource estimates involve some degree of uncertainty and 
may prove to be incorrect over time or may not accurately reflect actual discovered resource levels. The 
reliability of discovered resource estimates depends on the quality and quantity of technical and economic 
data, the production performance of the fields, and may also be subject to revision due to changes in 
published rules and guidance. 
We identify, assess, analyse, monitor and review continually to reduce the impact of this risk. Our risk 
management processes can be found in our SORMIC.
RISK #8: 
TECHNOLOGY RISK
Technology and innovation 
are essential for PETRONAS 
to remain competitive. If 
it inadvertently develops 
technologies and products 
that cause unfavourable 
effect to the environment or 
health of individuals, there 
could be a material adverse 
impact on its earnings, 
cash flows and financial 
condition.
Technology and innovation are essential to our efforts to meet the world’s energy demands in a competitive 
way. There could be a material adverse impact on the delivery of our strategy and our licence to operate if 
we do not develop the right technology and products, do not have access to such technology and products 
or do not deploy these effectively. If we are unable to develop the right technologies and products in a timely 
and cost-effective manner, or if we develop technologies and products that adversely impact the environment 
or health of individuals, there could be a material adverse impact on our earnings, cash flows and financial 
condition. 
PETRONAS is subject to fast-evolving risks from cyber threats. A breach or failure of our digital infrastructure 
including cyber-attacks could result in the loss or misuse of data or sensitive information, injury to people, 
disruption to our business, harm to the environment or our assets, legal or regulatory breaches and legal 
liability.
Our continued efforts in developing and deploying the right technology as well as robust digital 
infrastructure help manage this risk. The ways we mitigate these risks can be found throughout this 
report and in our SORMIC.

LEGAL COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK (LCF)
ANTI-BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION
To effectively manage legal compliance which embeds and integrates compliance assurance and reporting, PETRONAS has developed 
the Legal Compliance Framework (LCF) for critical legal areas as a control oversight and monitoring of compliance for the PETRONAS 
Group. It consists of a set of procedures, standards, and controls aimed to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements 
in the five (5) critical legal areas, which pose as enterprise risk to the PETRONAS Group. These critical legal areas are Ethics & Integrity, 
PETRONAS Integrity Compliance Framework (PICF)
The PICF was further enhanced to strengthen PETRONAS’ efforts and measures on the implementation of the new Section 17A of the 
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act, with emphasis on the Guidelines on Adequate Procedures (Adequate Procedures), as the 
Adequate Procedures are the pillars of defence against corporate liability, particularly corruption offenses. PETRONAS has taken a holistic 
approach in its implementation of the Adequate Procedures by adopting its principles of top level commitment, risk assessment, to 
undertake control measures such as a systematic review and to monitor for further development.
PETRONAS has continuously maintained its standards to the International Organization for Standardization 370001 on Anti-Bribery 
Management System (ISO 37001) certification where it validates PETRONAS’ strategy in implementing global best practices to combat 
bribery and corruption. The certification also evidences PETRONAS' commitment to anti-bribery and anti-corruption in a verifiable way and 
is a testament of PETRONAS’ zero tolerance against bribery and corruption.
PETRONAS has in place the following applicable governance documents in relation 
to the five (5) critical legal areas for adoption and implementation by companies 
across the PETRONAS Group. These governance documents such as policies, 
standards, guidelines, frameworks, procedures and others, form the basis for 
carrying out internal controls across the organisation within the PETRONAS Group.
Training and communication programmes are 
key to raising awareness and understanding of 
the five (5) critical legal areas across PETRONAS 
Group. Delivery of effective training programmes 
is high on the agenda for PETRONAS and its 
staff to inculcate and build strong compliance 
culture within the PETRONAS Group. PETRONAS’ 
heightened efforts can be seen in more than 250 
classroom trainings it conducted on the five (5) 
critical legal areas, the development of e-learning 
modules targeted to reach out to all PETRONAS 
staff groupwide as well as creating awareness 
through digital platforms, email blasts, banners 
and posters to ensure that PETRONAS staff are 
sufficiently trained and regularly updated on the 
five (5) critical legal areas and their related policies 
and guidelines.
During the year under review, PETRONAS 
directors also participated in training 
programmes, on-boarding sessions and seminars 
covering the areas of leadership, risk management 
and governance, particularly and specifically on 
corporate liability, emphasizing on Section 17A of 
the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act.
2019 also saw PETRONAS organising a PETRONAS 
Compliance Conference to communicate to 
external parties of its zero tolerance position to 
non-compliance with the five (5) critical legal 
areas and share PETRONAS’ best practices in 
ensuring good governance and compliance to the 
areas.

PETRONAS WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY AND PROCEDURES
PETRONAS continues to encourage disclosures to its secure, confidential and accessible 
whistleblowing channels, which are operated with the highest standards of integrity and 
accountability, while providing clarity on the oversight and responsibilities of the whistleblowing 
process, the reporting process, protection to whistleblowers and the confidentiality afforded to 
whistleblowers.
Applicable to every employee, officer, and director of PETRONAS, joint venture companies in 
which PETRONAS is not a controlling stakeholder and associate companies of PETRONAS are 
nevertheless encouraged to adopt this policy whilst contractors, agents, outsourced workers, and 
business associates are required to always act consistently with applicable parts of the policy when 
dealing with, acting on behalf of or in the name of PETRONAS. 
The Whistleblowing Policy and Procedures is available on PETRONAS’ corporate website at  
https://www.petronas.com/whistleblowing
Data Privacy, Sanctions, Export Control and Competition which are international laws with extra-territorial effect that could result in 
high civil and criminal penalties and severe reputational impact to the enterprise. LCF will be the structured process to manage and 
ensure compliance with the legal controls by PETRONAS entities within the PETRONAS Group.
The governance of business 
activities and operations at all 
levels within the PETRONAS 
Group is necessary to ensure 
compliance with the critical 
legal areas. To evaluate and 
monitor compliance status 
with the five (5) critical 
legal areas, an assurance 
program is established to 
identify potential areas of 
weakness, non-compliance, 
and/or unsound practices 
on the status of PETRONAS’ 
legal compliance to 
ensure effective and 
informed decision making 
for the business. The 
LCF assurance process is 
performed, documented and 
consolidated in PETRONAS’ 
integrated myAssurance 
platform.
Implementation of existing and new business practice across the PETRONAS’ Group as part of LCF 
control and risk mitigation: 
PETRONAS Privacy Notices and Statements for the PETRONAS Group 
The PETRONAS Privacy Notices and Statements (Privacy Notices and Statements) are notices 
and statements that are designed to provide notice of and assist in understanding why and how 
PETRONAS collects and uses personal data, to whom such data is disclosed and to whom data 
access requests can be addressed. In implementing the Privacy Notices and Statements, it will 
ensure that the flow and management of personal data processed by the PETRONAS Group is in 
compliance with the PETRONAS Corporate Privacy Policy, the Master Guidelines and applicable 
personal data protection and privacy laws.
Competition
The development of the PETRONAS Competition Law Compliance Protocol on Meetings and 
Information Sharing, and the PETRONAS Competition Law Compliance Protocol on Merger and 
Acquisition Transaction. These supplement the existing Competition Law Guidelines, having regards 
to the standard operating procedures in order to properly manage the risk inherent to the business 
operations of PETRONAS and provide general guidance on competition law in the areas which 
receive the greatest scrutiny from competition law enforcers worldwide.
Third Party Risk Management
The Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) is a due diligence process in order to safeguard the 
PETRONAS Group from any corporate liability that can be attributed to PETRONAS arising from the 
misconduct of third parties (e.g. partners, contractors, vendors, suppliers, distributors, agents and 
etc) in the five (5) critical legal areas.
The TPRM applies to all businesses to detect possible red-flags of potential third parties prior to any 
formal engagement, and seeks to provide the necessary mitigation or contractual safeguard against 
any risks of legal, financial or reputational damages that may be caused by them to PETRONAS. 
PETRONAS is committed towards ensuring its third parties observe and comply with the standards as 
set out in all its governance documents and regulatory requirements.

Statement on Risk Management
and Internal Control
RISK MANAGEMENT
Our risk management frameworks help identify and manage risk in 
a way that is supportive of our strategic priorities towards building 
a successful and sustainable business. Our approach towards risk 
management is framed by our ongoing understanding of the risks 
that we are exposed to, our risk appetite and how these risks change 
over time. Risks across the PETRONAS Group are being managed on 
an integrated basis within stipulated and approved Limits of Authority 
(LOA). Evaluations of those risks are incorporated into the decision-
making process.
Risk Management Committee (RMC)
The RMC was formed to serve as a platform 
to assist the ELT, the RC and the Board in 
identifying principal risks, and reviewing 
governing documents at the corporate 
level as well as provides assurance on 
risk management practices across the 
PETRONAS Group to protect and safeguard its 
interest. The RMC also promotes sound risk 
management practices through the sharing 
of information, best practices and lessons 
learnt to enhance the risk culture across the 
PETRONAS Group.
Risk Management Functions/Focus Risk Areas
Dedicated risk management functions exist 
within the PETRONAS Group, particularly for 
listed subsidiaries, to assess and evaluate the risk 
management processes for reporting to their 
respective Management and Board. Internal 
controls were also developed to facilitate 
standardisation of processes and practices 
across the PETRONAS Group for focus risk areas 
such as Financial, Health, Safety, Security and 
Environment (HSSE), Plant and Facilities, Project, 
Procurement, Digital, Reputation, Human 
Capital, and Country.
Executive Leadership Team (ELT)
The ELT was established to assist the President 
and Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) 
in the management of the Company and is 
responsible for providing a holistic approach 
to all business development strategies as well 
as high impact and high value investments 
including mergers and acquisitions. The ELT 
reviews key risk management matters to 
provide guidance and direction before RC and 
the Board reporting. The ELT has Focused ELT 
Meetings to discuss specific matters which 
include HSSE and People Development.
The PETRONAS Group has ongoing processes to manage principal 
risks affecting strategic objectives. This includes identifying, 
evaluating, managing and monitoring risks. These processes continue 
to be in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval 
of this statement.
Groupwide implementation of risk management and internal control

The PETRONAS Group’s system of risk management and internal control (refer to Chart 1) seeks to manage and control risks appropriately and 
are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. It also helps to ensure appropriate oversight 
and accountability of risk, that facilitates reporting and escalation to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the PETRONAS Group’s assets. All 
employees have a role to play in risk management and internal control. Assurance programmes are conducted regularly to ensure compliance 
with established governing documents and effectiveness of risk management implementation processes. This system provides reasonable but 
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, or the occurrence of unforeseeable circumstances.

communicates the management’s expectations in relation to risk management practices throughout the PETRONAS Group.
It is complemented by the PETRONAS Resiliency Model that provides an integrated and holistic view of the overall strategy to manage the 
PETRONAS Group’s risks, focusing on three areas of business resilience, namely Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), Crisis Management (CM) and 
Business Continuity Management (BCM). These are supported by risk management frameworks and the relevant guidelines to govern, guide and 
institutionalise risk management practices across the PETRONAS Group. The status of risk management practices across the PETRONAS Group 
are monitored and reported quarterly to the RMC.
Petroliam Nasional Berhad and its subsidiaries (the PETRONAS Group) are exposed to a variety of risks that can 
have an impact on our businesses and prospects, future performance, financial position, liquidity, asset values, 
growth potential, sustainable development and reputation. Risk management is one of the core responsibilities 
of the PETRONAS Board (the Board), and is central to the decision-making process. We recognise uncertainties 
attached to risk and opportunities, and continuously endeavour to build high levels of resilience. Effective risk 
management and internal control system is essential to the PETRONAS Group’s operations and governance 
processes. This helps the PETRONAS Group anticipate risk exposure, put controls in place to minimise threats 
and maximise opportunities. The result of such processes give full and due consideration to the balance of risk 
and reward in pursuing strategies to optimise the achievement of our objectives. This section explains the key 
features of our risk management and internal control system.
BOARD’S ACCOUNTABILITY 
The Board is responsible to oversee and ensure a sound system of risk 
management and internal control for the PETRONAS Group. An effective 
risk management framework helps the PETRONAS Group to achieve 
its optimal performance and profitability targets by incorporating risk 
information for better decision-making, while sound internal controls 
enable appropriate response to manage identified risks, thus facilitating 
effective and efficient operations while safeguarding shareholders’ 
investment and the PETRONAS Group’s assets. 
The Board is also cognisant of its role in providing risk oversight sets the 
tone and culture towards embedding risk management practices across 
the PETRONAS Group. 
The PETRONAS Board Charter includes risk management and internal 
control oversight as one of the main functions of the Board, in line with 
the requirements under the Companies Act 2016.
The Board risk oversight is supported by the following committees:
Board Audit Committee (BAC)
Established in 1985, the BAC assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities 
relating to internal controls and financial reporting by performing oversight 
functions on behalf of the Board to ensure good governance practices and 
proper conduct while safeguarding the PETRONAS Group’s assets.
Risk Committee (RC)
Established in 2010, the RC assists the Board in providing, among others, 
direction, guidance and oversight on risk management matters. The RC 
reviews risk policies, strategies, principal risks, risk practices and oversees the 
adequacy of the risk management system to effectively monitor and manage 
risks in the PETRONAS Group.

Enterprise Risk Management
The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) (refer Chart 3) process is an integral part of managing the business as it provides a guide to systematically 
identify, assess, treat, monitor and review risks. It aims to improve the ability to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of the identified risks that 
may affect the achievement of business objectives.
Risk profiles established through the ERM process are monitored at the corporate level and across the PETRONAS Group and consist of 
identified principal risks with the corresponding risk mitigations and key risk indicators. This allows actions to be taken to ensure that risks are 
being effectively managed by respective units. Such actions shall be endorsed by the Head of Department of the respective Holding Company 
Units (HCUs), Business Units (BUs) or Operating Units (OPUs), and reported to their respective Management and Board on quarterly basis.
The PETRONAS Group’s Risk Appetite articulates the type of risks that the PETRONAS Group is willing to accept to guide strategic decisions at 
the corporate level in pursuit of business values and objectives. It reflects the PETRONAS Group’s position, propensity and acceptability to take 
risks in various areas, namely strategic, financial, operational, reputational, while maintaining legal and regulatory compliance, and is defined 
by the respective area’s tolerances and threshold levels. At the corporate level, PETRONAS Group’s Risk Appetite is monitored and reported on 
quarterly basis to the ELT, RC and the Board.
Crisis Management
Crisis Management (CM) (refer Chart 4) is an integrated process that aims to prepare an organisation, at both domestic and international 
operations, to respond to and manage crises in the risk areas to protect People, Environment, Asset, and Reputation (PEAR).
Under CM, there is a three-tiered response protocol that provides the demarcation of roles and responsibilities between emergency site 
management, operating unit management, corporate and internal/external response agencies and/or authorities. Testing and Exercising (T&E) 
via simulation of test scenarios validates the effectiveness of response strategies as well as promotes continuous improvement as identified in 
the Emergency/Crisis Management Plan. T&E programmes are carried out at the respective HCUs, BUs and OPUs.

Business Continuity Management
Business Continuity Management (BCM) (refer Chart 5) is a management process that aims to build the capability of the PETRONAS Group to 
recover and continue delivery of products or services at acceptable predefined levels following any prolonged disruption.
Key to the BCM Framework, Business Continuity Plans (BCP) are established to enhance the PETRONAS Group’s preparedness to recover and 
restore businesses’ critical functions within a reasonable period in view of sustaining the PETRONAS Group’s activities and minimising disruptions 
to stakeholders. T&E via simulation of test scenarios validates the effectiveness of recovery strategies as well as maintains a high level of 
competence and readiness as identified in the BCP. T&E programmes are carried out at the respective HCUs, BUs and OPUs.
CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
In order to build highly capable practitioners to meet risk management requirements, the PETRONAS Group provides continuous risk 
management capability development and knowledge sharing programmes.
The risk management capability development programme consists of classes and e-learning modules which are carried out to build the 
competency of risk practitioners across the PETRONAS Group. Corporate membership to risk associations also provided platforms for risk 
practitioners to participate in risk management conferences and seminars to keep abreast with risk management standards and best practices.
The knowledge sharing programme consists of publications and conversations related to risk management, a community of practice and series 
of risk engagements, all of which propagate the sharing of current risk management practices and lessons learnt.

Limits of Authority
The Limits of Authority (LOA) is an instrument of delegation of 
Board’s powers which defines the decision-making limits within 
the PETRONAS Group, providing a balance between effective and 
quality decision-making and appropriate management control.
All LOA development and revisions are independently reviewed by 
the Group Financial Control Department, to ensure adherence and 
consistency with the PETRONAS Group LOA Framework and the 
PETRONAS LOA Guidelines.
Budget Approval
The budget approval process is an important internal control 
mechanism used by the PETRONAS Group to ensure an agreed 
allocation of resources and that the operational managers are 
sufficiently guided in making business decisions. The PETRONAS 
Group performs a comprehensive annual planning and budgeting 
exercise including the development and validation of business 
strategies for a rolling five-year period, and establishment of 
performance indicators against which BUs as well as subsidiary 
companies are evaluated.
The PETRONAS Group budget performance is reported to the 
Board on quarterly basis. The PETRONAS Group’s strategic 
directions are also reviewed at reasonable intervals taking into 
account changes in market conditions and significant business 
risks.
Financial Control Framework
The PETRONAS Group implements Financial Control Framework 
(FCF) with the principal objective of providing assurance on the 
quality of financial reporting through a structured process of 
HEALTH, SAFETY, SECURITY AND ENVIRONMENT (HSSE)
The PETRONAS Group’s Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) policy 
is supported by the HSE Management System (HSE MS) and the 
HSE Mandatory Control Framework (MCF). Besides this PETRONAS 
Security policy is supported by the Security Management System 
(SeMS) with Minimum Mandatory Security Standard (M2S2) to 
strengthen HSSE governance within the PETRONAS Group. HSE 
MCF includes clear requirements on health, operational  and process 
safety and environment for consistent and effective groupwide 
implementation, while the M2S2 outlines the minimum security 
standards required to effectively manage security risks and protect 
the PETRONAS Group’s assets.
The PETRONAS HSSE Executive Leadership Team (HSSE ELT) being 
the highest management committee, also steers groupwide HSSE 
policies, strategies as well as reviews PETRONAS’ HSSE performance 
through dedicated bi-annual meetings focused on HSSE matters. 
Group HSSE Leadership Team (GHSSE LT) is a platform to discuss 
ensuring the adequacy and effectiveness of key internal controls 
operating at various levels within the PETRONAS Group at all 
times.
The FCF requires among others, documentation of key controls, 
testing of internal control design effectiveness, remediation of 
control gaps as well as a periodic testing of control operating 
effectiveness. On a semi-annual basis, each key process owner at 
various management levels is required to complete and submit a 
letter of assurance which provides assurance on the effectiveness 
of the key controls for the areas that they are accountable for.
Corporate Financial Policy
The Corporate Financial Policy (CFP) prescribes the PETRONAS 
Group’s governing requirements in effecting the consistent 
practice of financial management, as well as to form the 
foundation upon which financial risk exposures are identified and 
strategies to manage such risks are developed.
The financial risk management practices are implemented across 
the PETRONAS Group in accordance with the requirements of the 
CFP. This enables visibility on the PETRONAS Group’s key financial 
risk exposures for improved risk management. Self-assessment 
and assurance fieldwork activities were conducted to assess 
compliance with CFP requirements on financial management and 
financial risk management.
In addition to the CFP, the PETRONAS Liquidity Risk Contingency 
Protocol (LRCP) and PETRONAS Trading Mandate have been 
established to safeguard PETRONAS Group’s liquidity position and 
its financial sustainability, as well as to ensure alignment of risk 
appetite between PETRONAS and its OPUs on trading activities.
effective execution of key strategies and associated issues that 
impact groupwide HSSE key result areas, risk management and 
internal controls, and provide guidance on the way forward. 
HSE and Security Risk Assessments were carried out to identify 
potential hazards/threats, analyse the adequacy of current HSE and 
Security measures and to propose mitigations, gap closure activities 
and counter measures. 
Group HSSE conducts assurance at OPUs to review the 
effectiveness of HSSE controls. OPUs carried out self-assessment 
on compliance with regulatory requirements and HSSE procedures. 
The findings from HSE and Security Risk Assessments and HSE 
Assurances were presented to HCU/BU/OPU management 
committees to provide them with a clear view of their respective 
HSE and Security risks.
As part of the PETRONAS Resiliency Model, internal controls are developed for focus risk areas to facilitate the standardisation of processes and 
practices across the PETRONAS Group, encompassing elements such as oversight structure, governing documents, reporting and assurance.
Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control
KEY INTERNAL CONTROLS
PLANT AND FACILITIES
The risk management of plant and facilities in PETRONAS is 
governed by Reliability and Integrity Management Systems (RIMS), 
PETRONAS Maintenance Management System (PMMS) Guideline, 
Plant and Facilities Risk Management (PFRM) Guideline, PETRONAS 
Technical Standard (PTS), PETRONAS Basic Technical Requirement 
(PBTR) and PETRONAS Technical Guideline (PTG).
PFRM prescribes the principles and structured processes in 
managing operational risks in accordance with the PETRONAS 
Resiliency Model. It guides plant and facilities to systematically 
identify, assess, control, monitor and review operational risks 
to improve the ability to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of 
identified risks. The remaining governing documents prescribe the 
specific system and work processes required by the PETRONAS 
Group’s plant and facilities over the asset life cycle in order to 
operate safely and achieve the targeted reliability, integrity, and 
performance.
The risk profiles of the respective plants and facilities have been 
developed through the PFRM process where risks are rated 
based on their probability and impact on the operations. These 
will determine the appropriate mitigations for every principal 
risk for actions to be taken to ensure that operational risks are 
being managed. In addition, plant and facilities self-assessment 
and assurance fieldwork activities were conducted to ensure 
groupwide plant and facilities internal controls are in place and in 
compliance with the established governing documents.
PROCUREMENT
Procurement management serves as a key function in supporting 
the management and is implemented based on the PETRONAS 
Procurement Management System (P2MS) as the standards and 
guidelines which describe the minimum requirements to govern 
procurement activities duly established for groupwide adoption.
The Group Procurement Leadership Team (GP LT) provides 
stewardship on the overall strategic direction of the Group 
Procurement (GP) sector. GP LT also reviews the overall performance 
of the sector’s business proposal, and progress of key strategic 
initiatives as well as resolve key issues of mutual concern and interest.
 
GP has clearly defined authorisation procedures for awarding tenders 
and all procurement transactions covering both capital and revenue 
expenditure items. Procurement Council, Category Councils and 
Tender Committees with cross functional representation provide 
the oversight functions on tendering while Contractor Performance 
Review Appeal Committee and Vendor Evaluation Committees 
deliberate on contractors’ and/or vendors’ performance matters 
prior to approval by the approving authorities as set out in the LOA 
approved by the respective boards. 
In addition, procurement assurance programmes are also conducted 
to assess compliance to the procurement process with regards 
to the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of the procurement 
management implementation.
DIGITAL
PETRONAS Group Digital is responsible to shape and drive a unifying 
digital vision and strategy groupwide and accelerate concerted 
effort in driving digital transformation for the PETRONAS Group. 
PETRONAS Group Digital is also accountable to uphold Digital and 
ICT governance across the PETRONAS Group in the areas of Cyber 
Security, Enterprise Architecture and Enterprise Data. 
PETRONAS Group Digital’s governance is led by the Chief Digital 
and Information Officer supported by dedicated committees such as 
Digital Council and Cyber Security Council.
 
PETRONAS Information Security is guided by the PETRONAS ICT 
Principles and PETRONAS Records Management Principles. It is 
supported by seven ICT Standards and Guidelines which set out 
the purpose, commitment and governance of ICT and Records 
Management which shall be adhered to by the PETRONAS Group.
 
The PETRONAS Information Security processes are accredited with 
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001:2013 
– Information Security Management System Standard. PETRONAS 
Group Digital has in place ICT security tools and procedures to 
detect, respond and mitigate any ICT-related threats.
PETRONAS Group Digital also has in place a Disaster Recovery Plan 
(DRP) for identified critical business applications. Scheduled drills and 
exercises are conducted annually to ensure readiness in the event of 
an ICT disaster. 
PROJECT 
Project risk management is implemented in accordance with the 
PETRONAS Project Management System (PPMS). The PPMS Phase 
Gated Process is designed to retain and maximise project value 
across a project’s life cycle from the identification of business 
opportunity until operationalisation of the project. 
The purpose of the PPMS Phase Gated Process is to bring a 
measure of rational processes to the decision-making associated 
with transforming business opportunity into operational assets. 
The PPMS Phase Gated Process consists of structured phases from 
framing, feasibility study, scope selection, scope definition, and 
execution to operationalisation. Each phase prescribes the project 
management standards to ensure consistency of practices.
Project risks are identified, assessed, mitigated and validated 
through assurance programmes under the PPMS framework. The 
processes are meant to reduce the risk of unexpected technical 
and/or commercial factors significantly affecting the project’s 
viability.

KEY INTERNAL CONTROLS
Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control
The internal audit function is an independent and objective assurance 
function that helps the PETRONAS Group to achieve its objective 
by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach in evaluating and 
improving the design and effectiveness of the PETRONAS Group’s 
governance, risk management and internal control. The primary 
role of the internal audit function, through its assurance activities, is 
to safeguard the PETRONAS Group’s value by protecting its assets, 
reputation and sustainability.
The PETRONAS Group Internal Audit (GIA) reports directly to the 
PETRONAS BAC. In addition, public listed subsidiaries within the 
PETRONAS Group have their own individual BACs. PETRONAS Group’s 
Internal Audit functions support their respective BACs to add value 
and improve the PETRONAS Group’s operations.
PETRONAS GIA’s position within the PETRONAS Group, its authority, 
responsibilities and scope of work, are defined in the Internal Audit 
Charter approved by the PETRONAS BAC. The Charter is aligned with 
the standards and principles outlined in the International Professional 
Practices Framework (IPPF) issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors 
(IIA). In performing audits, PETRONAS GIA refers to internal control 
framework and guidance issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). COSO is an 
internationally recognised organisation providing guidance on 
internal control, enterprise risk management and governance. In the 
PETRONAS Group context, enterprise risk management refers to 
PETRONAS Resiliency Model which covers ERM, CM and BCM.
The key responsibility of the PETRONAS’ Internal Audit functions is 
to assist the PETRONAS Group in accomplishing its goals by bringing 
a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the 
effectiveness of risk management, internal control and governance 
processes. The Internal Audit function maintains its impartiality, 
proficiency and due professional care by having its plans and reports 
directly under the purview of the respective BACs.
The respective BACs review reports on internal audits performed 
under its purview, which include the agreed corrective actions to be 
undertaken by the respective HCU/BU/OPU. These are then reported 
to PETRONAS BAC. The internal audit functions monitor the status 
of the agreed corrective actions through the Quarterly Audit Status 
Report submitted by the respective HCU/BU/OPU which have been 
assessed and verified by the internal audit. The consolidated status of 
the audit issues are submitted and presented to the respective BACs 
for deliberation on quarterly basis.
The risk management and internal control system discussed in this 
statement does not apply to entities where the PETRONAS Group 
does not have control, which includes joint arrangements.
The Board has received assurance from the President and Group CEO 
and the Executive Vice President and Group Chief Financial Officer 
that the PETRONAS Group’s financial records are properly maintained 
and that the risk management and internal control system is operating 
adequately and effectively in addressing the material risks within the 
PETRONAS Group in its current business environment.
The Board is of the view that risk management and internal control 
instituted throughout the PETRONAS Group are sound and provides 
a reasonable level of confidence, but not absolute assurance that 
the PETRONAS Group is not affected by any event that cannot be 
reasonably foreseen. 
For the year under review, the Board is not aware of any significant 
control failure or weakness that would have resulted in material 
losses, contingencies or uncertainties requiring separate disclosure in 
the Annual Report.
The Board however recognised the State of Sarawak’s claim issue which 
may give rise to material business impact. Measures have been taken 
including engagement with the shareholder to manage any risks that 
may arise from this issue. The State of Sarawak has also taken legal 
action against PETRONAS for the recovery of the alleged State Sales Tax 
(SST) and PETRONAS is currently defending this action. PETRONAS has 
also filed a judicial review application before the Kuching High Court to 
determine that the Sarawak Government does not have the legislative 
right to impose SST on petroleum products. On 13 March 2020, the 
Court has dismissed the said application. Whilst PETRONAS has filed for 
an appeal and stay of execution until the final disposal of the appeal, 
PETRONAS remains open to other means of resolution.
Following the recent precipitous decline in oil prices and the 
economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board will continue 
to review measures initiated by the PETRONAS Group to minimise the 
potential risk and impact arising from these situations.
The external auditors have reviewed this Statement on Risk 
Management and Internal Control pursuant to the scope set out in the 
Audit and Assurance Practice Guide (AAPG) 3, Guidance for Auditors 
on Engagements to Report on the Statement on Risk Management 
and Internal Control included in the Annual Report issued by the 
Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) for inclusion in the Annual 
Report of PETRONAS for the year ended 31 December 2019 and 
reported to the Board that nothing has come to their attention that 
cause them to believe that the statement intended to be included in 
the Annual Report of PETRONAS, in all material respects, has not been 
prepared in accordance with the disclosures required by paragraphs 
41 and 42 of the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control: 
Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers, or is factually inaccurate.
AAPG 3 does not require the external auditors to consider whether 
the Directors’ Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control 
covers all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the PETRONAS Group’s risk management and 
internal control system including the assessment and opinion by the 
Board of Directors and management thereon. The auditors are also 
not required to consider whether the processes described to deal with 
material internal control aspects of any significant problems disclosed 
in the Annual Report will, in fact, remedy the problems.
This statement is made in accordance with the resolution of the 
Board of Directors dated 22 April 2020.

OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION
Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were made out, the Directors took reasonable steps to ascertain 
that:
(i) 
the necessary actions had been taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the provisioning of doubtful debts and 
satisfied themselves that all known bad debts have been written off and adequate provision made for doubtful debts; and
(ii) 
any current assets which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business, their values as shown in the accounting 
records of the Group and of the Company, had been written down to an amount which they might be expected so to realise.
At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:
(i) 
that would render the amount written off for bad debts, or the amount of the provision for doubtful debts, in the Group and 
in the Company inadequate to any substantial extent, or
(ii) 
that would render the value attributed to the current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company 
misleading, or
(iii) 
which have arisen which render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of the 
Company misleading or inappropriate, or
(iv) 
not otherwise dealt with in this report or the financial statements, that would render any amount stated in the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company misleading.
At the date of this report, there does not exist:
(i) 
any charge on the assets of the Group or of the Company that has arisen since the end of the financial year and which secures 
the liabilities of any other person, or
(ii) 
any material contingent liability in respect of the Group or of the Company that has arisen since the end of the financial year.
No material contingent liability or other liability, other than as disclosed in the financial statements, of any company in the Group has 
become enforceable, or is likely to become enforceable within the period of twelve months after the end of the financial year which, 
in the opinion of the Directors, will or may substantially affect the ability of the Group and the Company to meet their obligations as 
and when they fall due.
In the opinion of the Directors, the financial performance of the Group and of the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 
2019 have not been substantially affected by any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature other than those that 
have been disclosed in the financial statements, nor has any such item, transaction or event occurred in the interval between the end 
of that financial year and the date of this report. 
In respect of the Directors or past Directors of the Company:
(i) 
the amount of fees and other benefits paid to or receivable by them from the Company or its subsidiary companies as 
remuneration for their services to the Company or its subsidiary companies; and
(ii) 
the estimated money value of any other benefits received or receivable by them otherwise than in cash from the Company or 
from any of its subsidiaries
are disclosed in note 37.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2019
1. 
BASIS OF PREPARATION
1.1 
Statement of compliance 
 
The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Malaysian Financial 
Reporting Standards (“MFRS”), International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act, 
2016 in Malaysia.
 
As of 1 January 2019, the Group and the Company had adopted new MFRSs, amendments to MFRSs and IC Interpretation 
(collectively referred to as “pronouncements”) that have been issued by the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board 
(“MASB”) as described fully in note 42.
 
MASB has also issued new and revised pronouncements which are not yet effective for the Group and the Company 
and therefore, have not been adopted in these financial statements. These pronouncements including their impact 
on the financial statements in the period of initial application are set out in note 42. There is no new or revised 
pronouncements that are not relevant to the operations of the Group and of the Company.
 
The financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 26 February 2020.
1.2 
Basis of measurement
 
The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared on historical cost basis except that, as 
disclosed in the accounting policies below, certain items are measured at fair value.
1.3 
Functional and presentation currency
 
The individual financial statements of each entity in the Group are prepared using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The functional currency of the Company has 
been determined as Ringgit Malaysia. The Group’s and the Company’s financial statements are presented in Ringgit 
Malaysia, which is the Company’s reporting currency.
 
All financial information is presented in Ringgit Malaysia and has been rounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise stated.
1.4 
Use of estimates and judgments 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with MFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 
 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
1. 
BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued)
1.4 
Use of estimates and judgments (continued)
 
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are described in the 
following notes:
 
 
(i) 
Note 3 
: Property, Plant and Equipment
 
(ii) 
Note 10 
: Intangible Assets
 
(iii)

(iv) 
Note 22 : Borrowings
 
(v)

2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements 
and have been applied consistently by the Group and the Company, unless otherwise stated.
 
Arising from the adoption of MFRS 16 Leases, there are changes to the accounting policies applied to lease contracts entered 
into by Group entities as compared to those adopted in previous financial statements. The impacts arising from the changes 
are disclosed in note 46.
 
At 1 January 2019, the Group and the Company have also applied the amendments in relation to MFRS 123 Borrowing Costs arising 
from the Annual Improvements to MFRS Standards 2015 – 2017 Cycle (“the Annual Improvement”). The Annual Improvement 
clarifies that general borrowing includes specific borrowings which no longer have a qualifying asset. Accordingly, the Group and 
the Company have capitalised borrowing costs for specific borrowing where the qualifying asset is no longer available, into the 
general borrowing. In previous years, the borrowing costs for specific borrowing were expensed off to profit or loss when the 
qualifying asset is no longer available. Changes in the accounting policies are disclosed in note 42.
2.1 
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
 
Subsidiaries are entities, including structured entities, controlled by the Company. The Group controls an entity when 
it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the entity. Potential voting rights are considered when assessing control only when 
such rights are substantive. The Group considers it has de facto power over an investee when, despite not having 
the majority of voting rights, it has the current ability to direct the activities of the investee that significantly affect the 
investee’s return. 
 
Investments in subsidiaries are measured in the Company’s statement of financial position at cost less any impairment 
losses, unless the investment is classified as held for sale or distribution. The cost of investment includes transaction costs.

2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.1 
Basis of consolidation (continued)
 
 
Subsidiaries (continued)
 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group from the 
date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
 
All inter-company transactions are eliminated on consolidation and revenue and profits relate to external transactions 
only. Unrealised losses resulting from inter-company transactions are also eliminated unless cost cannot be recovered.
 
Business combinations
 
A business combination is a transaction or other event in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method from the acquisition date, which is the date 
on which control is transferred to the Group. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at 
their fair values at the acquisition date. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair value of the 
consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. Non-controlling interests 
are stated either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition 
date. 
 
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group remeasures its previously held non-controlling equity 
interest in the acquiree at fair value at the acquisition date, with any resulting gain or loss recognised in the profit or 
loss. Increase in the Group’s ownership interest in an existing subsidiary is accounted for as equity transactions with 
differences between the fair value of consideration paid and the Group’s proportionate share of net assets acquired, 
recognised directly in equity.
 
The Group measures goodwill as the excess of the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of any previously held 
interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition 
date. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
 
Goodwill arising from business combinations prior to 1 October 2009 is stated at the previous carrying amount less 
subsequent impairments, pursuant to the adoption of MFRS framework by the Group in the financial year ended 
31 December 2012.
 
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issuance of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in 
connection with a business combination, are expensed as incurred.
 
Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the control of the shareholder that 
controls the Group are accounted for as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the earliest comparative 
period presented, or, if later, at the date that common control was established; for this purpose comparatives are 
restated. The assets and liabilities acquired are recognised at the carrying amounts recognised previously in the Group 
controlling shareholder’s consolidated financial statements. The components of equity of the acquired entities are 
added to the same components within Group equity and any resulting gain or loss is recognised directly in equity. 
2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.1 
Basis of consolidation (continued)
 
Non-controlling interests
 
Non-controlling interests at the end of the reporting period, being the portion of the net assets of subsidiaries 
attributable to equity interests that are not owned by the Company, whether directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, 
are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity within equity, 
separately from equity attributable to the shareholders of the Company. Non-controlling interests in the results of the 
Group are presented in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as an allocation of 
the profit or loss and total comprehensive income for the year between the non-controlling interests and shareholders 
of the Company.
 
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if 
doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance. 
 
The Group treats all changes in its ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control as equity 
transactions between the Group and its non-controlling interest holders. Any difference between the Group’s share of 
net assets before and after the change, and any consideration received or paid, is adjusted to or against Group reserves.
 
Loss of control 
 
Upon loss of control of a subsidiary, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the former subsidiary; any 
non-controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the former subsidiary from the consolidated 
statement of financial position. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognised in profit or loss. If 
the Group retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that 
control is lost, except when the retained interest is a joint arrangement or associate where such interest is measured at 
its carrying amount. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee or as a fair value through other 
comprehensive income financial asset depending on the level of influence retained.
2.2 
Associates
 
Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence including representation on the Board of Directors, 
but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies of the investee company.
 
Associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method less any impairment 
losses, unless it is classified as held for sale or distribution. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s 
share of post-acquisition profits or losses and other comprehensive income of the equity-accounted associates, 
after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence 
commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
 
The Group’s share of post-acquisition reserves and retained profits less losses is added to the carrying value of the 
investment in the consolidated statement of financial position. These amounts are taken from the latest audited 
financial statements or management financial statements of the associates.
 
When the Group’s share of post-acquisition losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted associate, the carrying 
amount of that interest (including any long term investments such as loans and advances) is reduced to nil and the 
recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments 
on behalf of the associate.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.2 
Associates (continued)
 
When the Group ceases to have significant influence over an associate, it is accounted for as a disposal of the entire 
interest in that associate, with the resulting gain or loss being recognised in the profit or loss. Any retained interest in 
the former associate at the date when significant influence is lost is measured at fair value and this amount is regarded 
as the initial carrying amount of a financial asset.
 
When the Group’s interest in an associate decreases but does not result in loss of significant influence, any retained 
interest is not re-measured. Any gain or loss arising from the decrease in interest is recognised in profit or loss. Any 
gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are also reclassified proportionately to the profit 
or loss if that gain or loss would be required to be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets and 
liabilities. 
 
Unrealised profits arising from transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interests in the associates. Unrealised losses on such transactions are also eliminated partially, unless cost 
cannot be recovered.
2.3 
Joint arrangements
 
Joint arrangements are arrangements of which the Group has joint control, established by contracts requiring 
unanimous consent for decisions about the activities that significantly affect the arrangements’ returns.
 
Joint arrangements are classified as either joint operation or joint venture. A joint arrangement is classified as joint 
operation when the Group or the Company has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to an 
arrangement. The Group and the Company account for each of its share of the assets, liabilities and transactions, 
including its share of those held or incurred jointly with the other investors, in relation to the joint operation. A joint 
arrangement is classified as joint venture when the Group has rights only to the net assets of the arrangement. 
The Group accounts for its interest in the joint venture using the equity method as described in note 2.2.
 
2.4 
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
 
 
Recognition and measurement
 
Freehold land and projects-in-progress are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses and are not depreciated. 
Other property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses, if any.
 
Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets and any other costs directly 
attributable to bringing the assets to working condition for their intended use, and the costs of dismantling and 
removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. The cost of self-constructed assets also includes 
the cost of material and direct labour. For qualifying assets, borrowing costs are capitalised in accordance with the 
accounting policy on borrowing costs. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment 
is capitalised as part of that equipment.
 
When the use of a property changes from owner-occupied to investment property, the property is reclassified as 
investment property at cost.
 
When significant components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted 
for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.4 
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation (continued)
 
Recognition and measurement (continued)
 
Subsequent costs
 
The cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount 
of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Group 
or the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced item of property, plant and 
equipment is derecognised with any corresponding gain or loss recognised in the profit or loss accordingly. The costs 
of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the profit or loss as incurred.
 
Depreciation
 
Depreciation for property, plant and equipment other than freehold land, oil and gas properties and projects-in-
progress, is recognised in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component 
of an item of property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment are not depreciated until the assets are 
ready for their intended use.
 
Amortisation of producing oil and gas properties is computed based on the unit of production method using total proved 
reserves for capitalised acquisition costs, certain facilities and wells. For other capitalised exploration, development 
costs, facilities and wells, total proved developed reserves are used.
 
The estimated useful lives of the other property, plant and equipment are as follows:
• 
Buildings 
5 - 80 years 
• 
Plant and equipment 
3 - 
67 years 
• 
Office equipment, furniture and fittings 
3 - 
10 years 
• 
Computer software and hardware 
3 - 
5 years 
• 
Motor vehicles 
3 - 
5 years 
• 
Vessels 
20 - 
30 years 
 
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to 
the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term (other than certain right-
of-use assets related to oil and gas properties which are depreciated using the unit of production method based on 
reserve cut-off at expiry of lease contract).
 
Estimates in respect of certain items of property, plant and equipment were revised during the year (refer note 3).
 
The depreciable amount is determined after deducting residual value. The residual value, useful life and depreciation 
method are reviewed at each financial year end to ensure that the amount, period and method of depreciation are 
consistent with previous estimates and the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied 
in the items of property, plant and equipment.
 
Derecognition
 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are 
expected from its use or disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the net carrying 
amount is recognised in the profit or loss.

2.5 
Investment properties
 
Investment properties are properties which are owned to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both, but 
not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative 
purpose. Properties that are occupied by the companies in the Group are accounted for as owner-occupied rather 
than as investment properties. 
 
Freehold land and projects-in-progress are stated at cost and are not depreciated. Other investment properties are 
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any, consistent with the accounting 
policy for property, plant and equipment as stated in note 2.4.
 
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property. The cost of 
self-constructed investment property includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly 
attributable to bringing the investment property to a working condition for its intended use and capitalised borrowing 
costs. 
 
Depreciation is recognised in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging between 
10 and 50 years for buildings.
 
An investment property is derecognised on its disposal, or when it is permanently withdrawn from use and no future 
economic benefits are expected from its disposal. The difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount is recognised in the profit or loss in the period in which the item is derecognised.

Land held for development consists of land or such portions thereof on which no development activities have been 
carried out or where development activities are not expected to be completed within the normal operating cycle. Such 
land is classified as non-current asset and is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value consistent with the 
accounting policy for inventories as stated in note 2.16.
 
Cost includes acquisition cost of land and attributable development expenditure. Cost associated with the acquisition 
of land includes the purchase price of the land, professional fees, stamp duties, commissions, conversion fees and 
other relevant levies. Development expenditure includes the cost for development of main infrastructure works.
 
Land held for development is reclassified as properties under development at the point when development activities 
have commenced and where it can be demonstrated that the development activities can be completed within the 
normal operating cycle. Properties under development are, in turn, reclassified as developed properties held for sale 
upon completion of the development activities.
 
Properties under development and developed properties held for sale are recognised as trade and other inventories in 
current assets. The accounting policy is described separately in note 2.16.
2.7 
Leases
 
The Group and the Company have applied MFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, under which the 
cumulative effect of initial application is recognised in retained earnings at 1 January 2019. Accordingly, the comparative 
information presented for 2018 has not been restated – i.e. it is presented, as previously reported under MFRS 117 
Leases and related interpretations.

(i) 
Definition of a lease
 
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a 
period of time in exchange for a consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the 
use of an identified asset, the Group and the Company assess whether:
• 
the contract involves the use of an identified asset – this may be specified explicitly or implicitly and should 
be physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier 
has a substantive substitution right, then the asset is not identified;
• 
the customer has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset 
throughout the period of use; and
• 
the customer has the right to direct the use of the asset when it has the decision-making rights that are most 
relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used. The customer has the right to direct the 
use of the asset if either the customer has the right to operate the asset; or the customer designed the asset 
in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be used throughout the period of use.
 
At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group and the Company 
allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component on the basis of their relative 
stand-alone prices.
(ii) 
Recognition and initial measurement
(a) 
As a lessee
 
The Group and the Company recognise a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement 
date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial 
direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore 
the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.
 
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at 
the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot 
be readily determined, the respective Group entities’ incremental borrowing rate is used. Generally, the 
Group entities use their incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.
 
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:
• 
fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
• 
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate 
as at the commencement date;
• 
amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee;
• 
the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group and the Company are reasonably certain 
to exercise; and
• 
penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group and the Company are reasonably certain 
not to early terminate the contract.

The Group and the Company exclude variable lease payments that linked to future performance or usage 
of the underlying asset from the lease liability. Instead, these payments are recognised in profit or loss in 
the period in which the performance or use occurs.
 
The Group and the Company assess at lease commencement whether it is reasonably certain to exercise 
the extension options in determining the lease term.
 
The Group and the Company have elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for 
short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The Group 
and the Company recognise the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.
 
The Group and the Company present right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment 
property in ‘property, plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities in ‘borrowings’ in the statement of financial 
position.
 
The accounting for MFRS 16 in joint operation depends on whether the Group is the operator or 
non-operator of a joint arrangement.
 
Where the Group is an operator and is the sole signatory to a lease contract of an asset to be used in the 
activities of a specific joint operation, the operator does so implicitly or explicitly on behalf of the joint 
arrangement. As is the customary norm in Upstream activities operated through joint arrangements, the 
operator will manage the lease, pay the lessor and subsequently re-bill the partners for their share of the 
lease costs. In such instances, it is necessary to determine whether:
• 
the operator is the sole lessee in the external lease arrangement, and if so, whether the billings to 
partners may represent sub-leases; or
• 
it is in fact the joint arrangement, which the lessee and other participants account for its 
proportionate share of the lease.
 
Where the Group is a non-operator, it is necessary to determine whether the finance sub-lease exists in 
the lease arrangement.
 
Depending on the facts and circumstances in each case, the Group recognises the lease liabilities based 
on the principles described below.

The Group as the operator of a joint operation
Where all partners in a joint operation are sharing the primary responsibility for lease payments under 
a contract, the related lease liability and right-of-use asset will be recognised net by the Group, on the 
basis of the Group’s participation interest in the joint operation.
The Group will recognise a lease liability fully when it has or considered having the primary responsibility 
for the full external lease payments. When a finance sub-lease exists between the Group and the 
non-operators, the Group will derecognise a portion of the right-of-use asset equal to the non-
operator’s interests in the lease, and instead recognise a corresponding finance lease receivable. A finance 
sub-lease will typically exist when the Group enters into a contract in its own name, where it has the 
primary responsibility for the external lease payments, and the leased asset is to be used on one specific 
joint operation, and the costs and risks related to the use of this asset are carried by that specific joint 
operation.
Where the use of the leased asset on a joint operation is not considered a finance sub-lease, the Group 
will recognise the related right-of-use asset and lease liability on a gross basis. Such expenses have 
under the previous lease accounting rules been reflected net by the Group, on the basis of the Group’s 
net participation interest in the joint operation. Expenses which are not included in a recognised lease 
obligation, such as payments for short-term leases, non-lease components and variable lease payments 
will continue to be reported net in the Group’s statement of profit or loss, on the basis of the Group’s net 
participation interest.
The Group as a non-operator of a joint operation
As a non-operator of a joint operation, the Group will recognise its proportionate share of a lease when 
the Group shares the primary responsibility for lease payments under a contract. This includes contracts 
where the Group has co-signed a lease contract and contracts for which the operator has been given a 
legally binding mandate to sign the external lease contract on behalf of the licence partners.
The Group will also recognise its proportionate share when a lease contract is entered by the operator 
of a joint operation, and where the operator’s use of the leased asset represents a sub-lease from the 
operator to the non-operators. A sub-lease is considered to take place in situations where the operator 
agrees with the non-operators for a specified period of time, and where the use of the asset is deemed 
to be controlled jointly by the joint operation.

Recognition and initial measurement (continued)
(b) 
As a lessor 
When the Group and the Company act as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is 
a finance lease or an operating lease.
To classify each lease, the Group and the Company make an overall assessment of whether the lease 
transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is 
the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease.
If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group and the Company apply 
MFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers to allocate the consideration in the contract based on 
the stand-alone selling price.
The Group and the Company recognise assets held under a finance lease in its statement of financial 
position and presents them as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. 
The Group and the Company use the interest rate implicit in the lease to measure the net investment in 
the lease.
When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease 
separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset 
arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term 
lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an 
operating lease.
(iii) 
Subsequent measurement
(a) 
As a lessee
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the 
commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the 
lease term (other than certain right-of-use assets related to oil and gas properties which are depreciated 
using the unit of production method based on reserve cut-off at expiry of lease contract). The estimated 
useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and 
equipment. Depreciation of certain right-of-use assets are subsequently capitalised into carrying amount 
of other assets whenever they meet the criteria for capitalisation. In addition, the right-of-use asset is 
periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease 
liability. 
The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured 
when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is 
a revision of in-substance fixed lease payments, or if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the 
amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment 
of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. The Group will reassess whether 
it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension option if there is a significant change in circumstances 
within its control.

Subsequent measurement (continued)
(a) 
As a lessee (continued)
When the lease liability is remeasured as described in the above paragraph, a corresponding adjustment 
is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying 
amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
When there is lease modification due to increase in the scope of lease by adding the right-to-use one 
or more underlying assets, the Group and the Company assess whether the lease modification shall be 
accounted for as a separate lease or similar to reassessment of lease liability. The Group and the Company 
account for lease modification as a separate lease when the consideration for the lease increases by 
an amount commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope and any appropriate 
adjustments.
When there is lease modification due to decrease in scope, the Group and the Company decrease the 
carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and remeasure the lease liability to reflect the partial or full 
termination of the lease. The corresponding gain or loss shall be recognised in profit or loss. Lease 
liabilities are remeasured for all other lease modifications with corresponding adjustments to the right-
of-use asset.
(b) 
As a lessor 
The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term as part of “revenue”.
The Group recognises finance income over the lease term, based on a pattern reflecting a constant 
periodic rate of return on the Group’s net investment in the lease. The Group aims to allocate finance 
income over the lease term on a systematic and rational basis. The Group applies the lease payments 
relating to the period against the gross investment in the lease to reduce both the principal and the 
unearned finance income. The net investment in the lease is subject to impairment requirements in 
MFRS 9 Financial Instruments (see note 2.12).
Previous financial year
Leased assets
 
A lease arrangement was accounted for as finance or operating lease in accordance with the accounting policy as 
stated below. When the fulfilment of an arrangement was dependent on the use of a specific asset and the arrangement 
conveys a right to use the asset, it was accounted for as a lease in accordance with the accounting policy below 
although the arrangement did not take the legal form of a lease.

Previous financial year (continued)
Finance lease 
 
A lease was recognised as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership 
to the Group and the Company. Upon initial recognition, the leased asset was measured at an amount equal to the 
lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset 
was accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. The corresponding liability was 
included in the statement of financial position as non-current liabilities.
 
Minimum lease payments made under finance leases were apportioned between the finance costs and the reduction 
of the outstanding liability. Finance costs, which represent the difference between the total leasing commitments and 
the fair value of the assets acquired, were recognised in the profit or loss and allocated over the lease term so as to 
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each accounting period. 
 
Contingent lease payments, if any, were accounted for by revising the minimum lease payments over the remaining 
term of the lease when the lease adjustment was confirmed.
 
Leasehold land which in substance was a finance lease was classified as property, plant and equipment, or as investment 
property if held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both.
 
Operating lease
 
All leases that did not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership to the Group and the 
Company were classified as operating leases, and the leased assets were not recognised on the Group’s and the 
Company’s statement of financial position. 
 
Payments made under operating leases were recognised as an expense in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease. Lease incentives received were recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term 
on a straight-line basis. Contingent rentals were charged to profit or loss in the reporting period in which they were 
incurred.
 
Leasehold land which in substance, an operating lease was classified as prepaid lease payments.
 
Prepaid lease payments
 
 
Prepaid rental and leasehold land which in substance was an operating lease were classified as prepaid lease payments. 
The payments made on entering into a lease arrangement or acquiring a leasehold land were accounted for as prepaid 
lease payments that were amortised over the lease term in accordance with the pattern of benefits provided.
2.8 
Investments
 
Long term investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are stated at cost less impairment loss, if any, 
in the Company’s financial statements unless the investment is classified as held for sale or distribution. The cost of 
investments includes transaction costs.
 
The carrying amount of these investments includes fair value adjustments on shareholder’s loans and advances, if any 
(note 2.12(i)).
2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.9 
Intangible assets
Goodwill 
 
Goodwill arising from business combinations is initially measured at cost as described in note 2.1. Following the initial 
recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised but 
instead, it is reviewed for impairment, annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may be impaired. 
 
In respect of equity-accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment. The entire carrying amount of the investment is reviewed for impairment when there is objective evidence 
of impairment.
 
Exploration expenditure
 
Intangible assets also include expenditure on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources 
(hereinafter collectively referred to as “exploration expenditure”). The accounting policy for exploration expenditure is 
described separately in note 2.10.
 
Other intangible assets
 
Intangible assets other than goodwill and exploration expenditure are measured on initial recognition at cost. The costs 
of intangible assets acquired in a business combination are their fair values as at the date of acquisition.  
 
Following initial recognition, intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and any accumulated impairment losses.
 
Amortisation for intangible assets with finite useful lives is recognised in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over 
the estimated economic useful lives, other than certain recoverable expenditure incurred under a service contract 
which is amortised based on unit of production method, which is calculated based on entitlement of production for 
the period, and estimated entitlement for the remaining life of the asset. 
 
For the Development and Production Service Contracts (“DPSC”) assets, the Group amortises through the unit of 
production method, which is calculated based on entitlement of production for the period over the entitlement of 
production for the period and estimated entitlement for the remaining life of the DPSC. 
 
Estimates are made in relation to expected entitlement of production which are based on the actual cost incurred but 
yet to be recovered and application of the prevailing crude oil price. The amortisation method and the useful life for 
intangible assets are reviewed at least at each reporting date. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever 
there is indication that the intangible assets may be impaired.
 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. These intangible 
assets are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may be impaired.

Exploration and development expenditure
 
The Group follows the successful efforts method of accounting for the exploration and development expenditure.

Exploration and development expenditure (continued)
 
Exploration expenditure 
 
Costs directly associated with an exploration well, including license acquisition, costs of acquiring undeveloped land 
and drilling costs, are initially capitalised as intangible assets until the results have been evaluated.
 
If a well does not result in successful discovery of economically recoverable volume of hydrocarbons or the costs of 
undeveloped land that expires, such costs are impaired or written off. If hydrocarbons are found and, subject to further 
appraisal activity which may include the drilling of further wells, are likely to be capable of commercial development 
under prevailing economic conditions, the costs continue to be carried as intangible assets. Such costs are reviewed 
at least once a year to determine whether the reserves found or appraised remain economically viable. When this is no 
longer the case, the costs are impaired or written off.
 
Where development plan is commercially viable and approved by the relevant authorities, the related exploration and 
evaluation costs are transferred to projects-in-progress in property, plant and equipment.
 
Development expenditure
 
Development expenditure comprises all costs incurred in bringing a field to commercial production and is capitalised 
as incurred. The amount capitalised includes attributable interests and other financing costs incurred on exploration 
and development before commencement of production.
 
Upon commencement of production, the exploration and development expenditure initially capitalised as projects-
in-progress are transferred to oil and gas properties and are depreciated as described in the accounting policy for 
property, plant and equipment and depreciation (note 2.4).
2.11 
Non-current assets held for sale 
 
Non-current assets and disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered primarily 
through sale rather than through continuing use, are classified as held for sale. This condition is regarded as met only 
when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
 
Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets (or all the assets and liabilities in a disposal group) are 
remeasured in accordance with the Group’s applicable accounting policies. Thereafter, on initial classification as held 
for sale, the assets or disposal groups are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. 
Any differences are charged to the profit or loss.
 
Any impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro 
rata basis, except that no impairment loss is allocated to inventories, contract assets, contract costs, financial assets, 
deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets and investment property, which continue to be measured in accordance 
with the Group’s accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale or distribution and 
subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss. Gains are not recognised in excess of 
any cumulative impairment loss.
 
Intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investment properties once classified as held for sale are not 
amortised nor depreciated. In addition, equity accounting of equity-accounted investees ceases once classified as held 
for sale.
2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.12 
Financial instruments
 
Recognition and initial measurement
 
A financial instrument is recognised in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group or the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
 
Regular way purchases or sales were recognised on the trade date i.e. the date that the Group and the Company 
commit to purchase or sell the financial asset.
 
A financial asset (unless it is a receivable without a significant financing component) and a financial liability is measured 
at fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial instrument not at fair value through profit or loss, any directly 
attributable transaction cost incurred at the acquisition or issuance of the financial instrument. A receivable that does 
not contain a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. 
 
Fair value adjustments on shareholder’s loans and advances at initial recognition, if any, are added to the carrying value 
of investments in the Company’s financial statements.
 
Classification and subsequent measurement
(i) 
Financial assets
 
Financial assets are classified as measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income 
(“FVOCI”) and fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”), as appropriate. 
 
The Group and the Company determine the classification of financial assets at initial recognition and are not 
reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing 
financial assets in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting 
period following the change in the business model.
 
Amortised cost
 
Amortised cost category comprises financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is to 
hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The financial assets are 
not designated as fair value through profit or loss. 
 
Subsequent measurement
 
Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method (note 2.12 (v)). Interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit 
or loss.
 
Fair value through other comprehensive income
 
Debt instruments
 
This category comprises debt instruments where it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by 
both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and its contractual terms give rise on specified 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. 
The debt instruments are not designated as at fair value through profit or loss.

Equity instruments
 
Fair value through other comprehensive income category also comprises investment in equity that are not held 
for trading, and the Group and the Company irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment’s 
fair value in other comprehensive income. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. 
 
Subsequent measurement
 
Financial assets categorised as fair value through other comprehensive income are subsequently measured at 
fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated 
under fair value through other comprehensive income reserve in equity. For debt instruments, when the 
investment is derecognised or determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recorded 
in equity is reclassified to the profit or loss. For equity instruments, the gains or losses accumulated in other 
comprehensive income are never reclassified to profit or loss.
 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
 
All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive 
income as described above are measured at fair value through profit or loss. This includes derivative financial 
assets (except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract as per note 2.12 (iii)). On initial recognition, 
the Group and the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements 
to be measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income as at fair value through 
profit or loss if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. 
 
Subsequent measurement
 
Financial assets categorised as fair value through profit or loss are subsequently measured at their fair value with 
gains or losses recognised in the profit or loss. The methods used to measure fair value are stated in note 2.25.

(ii) 
Financial liabilities
 
 
The categories of financial liabilities at initial recognition are as follows:
 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
 
Fair value through profit or loss category comprises financial liabilities that are derivatives (except for a derivative 
that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument), contingent consideration 
in a business combination and financial liabilities that are specifically designated into this category upon initial 
recognition. 
 
On initial recognition, the Group or the Company may irrevocably designate a financial liability that otherwise 
meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost as at fair value through profit or loss:
(a) 
if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise; 
(b) 
a group of financial liabilities or financial assets and financial liabilities is managed and its performance is 
evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, 
and information about the Group is provided internally on that basis to the Group’s key management 
personnel; or
(c) 
if a contract contains one or more embedded derivatives and the host is not a financial asset in the scope 
of MFRS 9, where the embedded derivative significantly modifies the cash flows and separation is not 
prohibited.
 
Financial liabilities categorised as fair value through profit or loss are subsequently measured at their fair value 
with gains or losses, including any interest expense are recognised in the profit or loss. 
 
For financial liabilities where it is designated as fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition, the 
Group and the Company recognise the amount of change in fair value of the financial liability that is attributable 
to change in credit risk in the other comprehensive income and remaining amount of the change in fair value 
in the profit or loss, unless the treatment of the effects of changes in the liability’s credit risk would create or 
enlarge an accounting mismatch.
 
Amortised cost
 
Subsequent to initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method (see note 2.12 (v)).
 
Gains and losses are recognised in the profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the 
amortisation process.
(iii) 
Financial guarantee contracts 
 
 
A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the 
holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the 
terms of a debt instrument.

The Group and the Company use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate and foreign currency 
swaps, forward rate contracts, futures and options, to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign 
currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. 
 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is 
entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the 
fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year are recognised in the profit 
or loss.
 
In general, contracts to sell or purchase non-financial items to meet expected own use requirements are 
not accounted for as financial instruments. However, contracts to sell or purchase commodities that can be 
net settled or which contain written options are required to be recognised at fair value, with gains and losses 
recognised in the profit or loss.
 
An embedded derivative is recognised separately from the host contract where the host contract is not a 
financial asset, and accounted for separately if, and only if, the derivative is not closely related to the economic 
characteristics and risks of the host contract and the host contract is not measured at fair value through profit 
or loss. The host contract, in the event an embedded derivative is recognised separately, is accounted for in 
accordance with policy applicable to the nature of the host contract.
(v) 
Effective interest method
 
Amortised cost was computed using the effective interest method. This method used effective interest rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial 
instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial instrument. Amortised cost takes into account any 
transaction costs and any discount or premium on settlement.

Classification and subsequent measurement (continued)
(vi) 
Offsetting of financial instruments
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial 
position if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is 
an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
(vii) 
Amortised cost of financial instruments
 
 
Interest income is recognised by applying effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount except for credit 
impaired financial assets (see note 2.13 (i)) where effective interest rate is applied to the amortised cost.
 
(viii) Derecognition of financial instruments
 
A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or, the 
Group and the Company have transferred their rights to receive cash flows from the asset or have assumed an 
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a “pass-through” 
arrangement without retaining control of the asset or substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset.
 
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of the 
consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative 
gain or loss that had been recognised in equity is recognised in the profit or loss, except for equity investments at 
fair value through other comprehensive income where the gain or loss are recognised in other comprehensive 
income.
 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expired. 
On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liabilities 
extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets 
transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the profit or loss. 
2.13 
Impairment
(i) 
Financial assets, contract assets and finance lease receivables
 
 
The Group and the Company recognise loss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets measured 
at amortised cost, debt investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, contract 
assets and finance lease receivables. 
 
The Group and the Company measure loss allowances on debt securities and cash and cash equivalent at an 
amount equal to lifetime expected credit loss, except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit 
risk at the reporting date, other debt securities for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial 
recognition and finance lease receivables, which are measured as 12-month expected credit loss.
 
Loss allowances for trade receivables and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime 
expected credit loss.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
 
2.13 
Impairment (continued)
(i) 
Financial assets, contract assets and finance lease receivables (continued)
 
When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition 
and when estimating expected credit loss, the Group and the Company consider reasonable and supportable 
information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and 
qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment 
and including forward-looking information, where available. 
 
The Group and the Company assume that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is past due.
 
The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations 
to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security. 
 
 
Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the 
expected life of a financial instrument, while 12-month expected credit losses are the portion of expected credit 
losses that result from default events that are possible within the 12-month after the reporting date. 
 
The maximum period considered when estimating expected credit losses is the maximum contractual period 
over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.
 
 
An impairment loss in respect of financial assets measured at amortised cost is recognised in profit or loss and 
the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account. 
 
 
An impairment loss in respect of debt investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
is recognised in profit or loss and the allowance account is recognised in other comprehensive income.
 
All financial assets, except for those measured at fair value through profit or loss and equity investments 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, contract assets and finance lease receivables are 
subject to impairment (see note 2.12 (i)).
(ii) 
Other assets
 
The carrying amounts of other assets, other than inventories, deferred tax assets and non-current assets or 
disposal groups classified as held for sale, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. 
 
If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised if the 
carrying amount of an asset or the cash-generating unit to which it belongs exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss.
 
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows from continuing use 
that are largely independent from other assets and groups. An impairment loss recognised in respect of a cash-
generating unit is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to 
reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.13 
Impairment (continued)
(ii) 
Other assets (continued)
 
 
The recoverable amount is the greater of the asset’s fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. In assessing 
value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an 
asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the 
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
 
For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the 
recoverable amount is estimated each period at the same time.
 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed in the subsequent period. In respect of other assets, 
impairment losses are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss 
had been recognised.
 
Reversals of impairment losses are credited to the profit or loss in the year in which the reversals are recognised. 
2.14 
Cash and cash equivalents
 
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and bank balances, deposits with licensed financial institutions 
and highly liquid investments which have an insignificant risk of changes in fair value and are used by the Company in 
the management of their short-term commitments. For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash 
equivalents are presented net of bank overdrafts and deposits restricted, if any.
2.15 
Contract assets and contract liabilities
 
Contract assets represent the Group and the Company’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that 
the entity has transferred to a customer when that right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. 
Contract assets are subjected to impairment in accordance to MFRS 9 Financial Instruments (see note 2.13 (i)).
 
Contract liabilities represent the Group and the Company’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for 
which the Group and the Company have received consideration, or the amount is due from the customer.
2.16 
Inventories 
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
 
Cost of crude oil and condensates includes costs of bringing the inventories to their present location and condition and 
is determined on a weighted average basis. 
 
Cost of petroleum products includes crude oil costs, export duty, transportation charges and processing costs and is 
determined on a weighted average basis.

Inventories (continued)
 
Cost of liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and petrochemical products includes raw gas costs and production overheads and 
is determined on a weighted average basis.
 
Cost of material stores and spares consists of the invoiced value from suppliers and import duty charges and is 
determined on a weighted average basis.
 
Cost of developed properties held for sale and properties under development consists of costs associated with the 
acquisition of land, all costs that are directly attributable to development activities, appropriate proportions of common 
costs attributable to developing the properties, and interest expenses incurred during the period of active development.
 
Lifting of offtake arrangements for crude oil and condensate produced in jointly-owned operations are such that it 
is not practicable for each participant to receive or sell its precise share of the overall production during the period. 
At each reporting date, the extent of underlift is recognised as an asset at the lower of the cost and net realisable value, 
while overlift is recognised as a liability. The net movement in underlift and overlift is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income in cost of revenue.
2.17 
Provisions
 
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group and the Company have a present legal or constructive 
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future net cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting 
is used, the accretion in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as finance cost. 
 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the net expenditure required to settle the present obligation 
at the reporting date. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
 
Possible obligations whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
future events not wholly within the control of the Group, are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed 
as contingent liabilities unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote.
 
In particular, information about provisions that have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the 
financial statements is described in note 24.
2.18 
Employee benefits 
 
Short term benefits
 
Wages and salaries, bonuses and social security contributions are recognised as an expense in the year in which the 
associated services are rendered by employees of the Group and the Company.
 
Defined contribution plans
 
As required by law, companies in Malaysia make contributions to the state pension scheme, the Employees Provident 
Fund (“EPF”). 
2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.18 
Employee benefits (continued)
 
Defined contribution plans (continued)
 
Some of the Group’s foreign subsidiaries make contributions to their respective countries’ statutory pension schemes 
and certain other independently-administered funds which are defined contribution plans. 
 
Such contributions are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss as incurred.
2.19 
Taxation
 
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the profit or 
loss except to the extent it relates to a business combination or items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity or other comprehensive income.
 
Current tax
 
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using the statutory tax rates at the 
reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
 
Deferred tax
 
Deferred tax is provided for, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. In principle, deferred tax liabilities 
are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences, unabsorbed capital allowances, unused reinvestment allowances, unused investment tax allowances, 
unused tax losses and other unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences, unabsorbed capital allowances, unused reinvestment allowances, 
unused investment tax allowances, unused tax losses and other unused tax credits can be utilised.
 
Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill and the 
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and that affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
 
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability 
is settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, 
and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities 
where they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised 
simultaneously. 
 
 
Deferred tax asset is reviewed at each reporting date and is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the 
future taxable profit will be available against which the related tax benefit can be realised.

2.20 Foreign currency transactions
 
In preparing the financial statements of individual entities in the Group, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s 
functional currency (foreign currencies) are translated to the functional currencies at rates of exchange ruling on the 
transaction dates. 
 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date have been retranslated to the 
functional currency at rates ruling on the reporting date.
 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which are measured at fair value, are retranslated 
to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the date when the fair value was determined. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currency are not retranslated. 
 
Gains and losses on exchange arising from retranslation are recognised in the profit or loss, except for differences 
arising on retranslation of equity instruments at FVOCI, which are recognised in equity and are never reclassified to 
profit or loss.
 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than Ringgit Malaysia, 
are translated into Ringgit Malaysia at the exchange rates ruling at reporting date, except for goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising from business combinations before 1 April 2011 which are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
acquirer company pursuant to the adoption of MFRS framework. 
 
The income and expenses are translated at the exchange rates at the date of the transactions or an average rate that 
approximates those rates. All resulting exchange differences are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve within 
equity.
 
In the consolidated financial statements, when settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to the Group’s 
foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from 
such a monetary item are considered to form part of the net investment in a foreign operation and are reclassified to 
other comprehensive income and accumulated under foreign currency translation reserve in equity. Upon disposal of 
the investment, the cumulative exchange differences previously recorded in equity are reclassified to the consolidated 
profit or loss.
2.21 
Borrowing costs and foreign currency exchange differences relating to projects-in-progress
 
Borrowing costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, 
which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to be prepared for their intended use or sale, are 
capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
 
The capitalisation of borrowing costs as part of the cost of a qualifying asset commences when expenditure for the 
asset is being incurred, borrowing costs are being incurred and activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its 
intended use or sale are in progress. Capitalisation of borrowing costs ceases when all activities necessary to prepare 
the qualifying asset for its intended use or sale are completed.
 
Exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings, although regarded as an adjustment to borrowing 
costs, are not capitalised but instead recognised in the profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.21 
Borrowing costs and foreign currency exchange differences relating to projects-in-progress (continued)
Current financial year 
 
The capitalisation rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation is the weighted 
average of borrowings that are outstanding during the year, other than borrowings made specifically for the purpose of 
financing a specific qualifying asset, in which the actual borrowing cost incurred on that borrowing less any investment 
income on the temporary investment of that borrowings, will be capitalised. Borrowings costs incurred subsequent to 
the completion of a specific qualifying asset are included in the determination of the capitalisation rate.
 
Previous financial year
 
In previous years, borrowing costs incurred subsequent to the completion of a specific qualifying asset were expensed 
off to profit or loss.
2.22 
Revenue
 
 
Revenue from contract with customers is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer 
and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group or the Company recognises revenue when or 
as it transfers control over a product or service to customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains 
control of the asset.
 
An entity transfers control of a good or service over time and, therefore, satisfies a performance obligation and 
recognises revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:
(a) 
the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance as the 
entity performs; 
(b) 
the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work-in-progress) that the customer 
controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or
(c) 
the entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an 
enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
 
If a performance obligation is not satisfied over time in accordance with the above criteria, an entity satisfies the 
performance obligation and recognises revenue at a point in time.
 
Revenue arising from shipping activities is mainly from freight income and charter income. Freight income and the 
relevant discharged costs of cargoes loaded onto vessels up to the reporting date are accrued for in the profit or loss 
based on percentage of completion method. Charter income is accrued on time accrual basis.
 
Revenue arising from rental income of investment properties is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
lease under the lease arrangement per note 2.7.
 
Revenue arising from gas trading activities, where forward and future sale and purchase contracts for gas have been 
determined to be for trading purposes, the associated sales and purchases are reported net within sales.

2.22 
Revenue (continued)
 
Revenue arising from investments yielding dividend is recognised when the shareholders’ right to receive payment is 
established.
 
Revenue arising from assets yielding interest is recognised on a time proportion basis that takes into account the 
effective yield on the assets.
2.23 
Financing costs
 
Financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings and profit sharing margin on Islamic Financing Facilities, as 
well as accretion in provision due to the passage of time.
 
All interest and other costs incurred in connection with borrowings are expensed as incurred, other than that capitalised 
in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.21. The interest component of finance lease payments is 
accounted for in accordance with the policy set out in note 2.7.
2.24 Operating segments
 
An operating segment is a component of the Group and the Company that engages in business activities from which 
it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the 
Group’s and the Company’s other components, and for which discrete financial information is available. An operating 
segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker, which in this case is the 
PETRONAS Executive Leadership Team, to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to 
assess its performance.  
2.25 
Fair value measurements
 
Fair value of an asset or a liability, except for lease transactions, is determined as the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
The measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal 
market or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market.
(i) 
Financial instruments
 
The fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organised financial markets are determined by 
reference to quoted market prices at the close of business at the end of reporting date. For financial instruments 
where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. Such techniques may 
include using recent arm’s length market transactions; reference to the current fair value of another instrument 
that is substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models. 
2. 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.25 
Fair value measurements (continued)
 
(ii) 
Non-financial assets
 
For non-financial assets, the fair value measurement takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that 
would use the asset in its highest and best use.
 
 
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group and the Company use observable market data 
as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the input used 
in the valuation technique as follows:
 
• Level 1  –  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identifiable assets or liabilities.  
 
• Level 2  –  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,  
 
  
 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
 
• Level 3  –  Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable input).
 
The fair value of an asset to be transferred between levels is determined as of the date of the event or change in 
circumstances that caused the transfer.
 
The Group and the Company recognise transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the date of the 
event or change in circumstances that caused the transfers.
2.26 
Government grants
 
Government grants related to assets, including non-monetary grants at fair value, are deducted against the construction 
cost of the assets. Subsequently, the grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the life of the 
asset as a reduced depreciation expense.

Extension options 
 
Some lease contracts contain extension options exercisable only by the Group and the Company before the end of the 
non-cancellable contract period. Where practicable, the Group and the Company include extension options in leases 
contracts to provide operational flexibility. The discounted potential future lease payments arising from exercisable 
extension options not included in the lease liabilities as the extension terms are uncertain due to the Group and the 
Company are currently finalising the extension terms as at reporting date.
 
Significant judgements and assumptions in relation to leases
 
The Group and the Company assess at lease commencement by applying significant judgement whether it is reasonably 
certain to exercise the extension options. The Group and the Company consider all facts and circumstances including 
their past practice and any cost that will be incurred to change the asset if an option to extend is not taken, to help them 
determine the lease term.
 
The Group and the Company also applied judgement and assumptions in determining the incremental borrowing 
rate of the respective leases. The Group and the Company first determine the closest available borrowing rates before 
using significant judgement to determine the adjustments required to reflect the term, security, value or economic 
environment of the respective leases.

Security
 
Property, plant and equipment of certain subsidiaries costing RM7,577 million (2018: RM7,885 million) have been 
pledged as security for loan facilities as set out in note 22 and note 23 to the financial statements.
 
Projects-in-progress
 
Included in additions to projects-in-progress of the Group is borrowing costs capitalised during the year of RM1,514 
million (2018: RM93 million) and capitalisation of depreciation charge for the year of right-of-use assets of RM202 
million (2018: Nil). The interest rate on borrowings costs capitalised ranges from 4.3% - 7.0% (2018: 3.2% - 3.3%) per 
annum.
 
Restriction of land title
 
The titles to certain freehold and leasehold land are in the process of being registered in the subsidiaries’ name. Certain 
long term leasehold land of the Group cannot be disposed of, charged or sub-leased without the prior consent of the 
relevant authority.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (continued)
 
Change in estimates
 
During the year, the Group and the Company revised the estimated future cost of decommissioning of oil and gas properties. 
The revision was accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimates resulting in an increase in cost of oil and gas 
properties of the Group and of the Company by RM2,507 million (2018: RM3,246 million) and RM787 million (2018: RM4,727 
million) respectively (refer note 24).
 
Estimation of oil and gas reserves
 
Oil and gas reserves are key elements in the Group’s and the Company’s investment decision-making process. Estimation of 
oil and gas reserves are normally conducted using industry recognised method. 
 
The term “reserves” describes the recoverable quantity of oil and gas volumes that are commercially viable for development 
given the prevailing economic situation present at the time of estimation.
 
Reserves estimates are normally presented alongside the range of level of certainties namely P1 (high level of certainty for 
proved reserves), P2 (mean level of certainty for probable reserves) and P3 (low level of certainty for possible reserves). The 
level of certainties depends on the availability and understanding of the geological and reservoir data available at the time of 
estimation and is normally represented in the form of a probability distribution.
 
The reserves are further subdivided into developed and undeveloped categories. Developed reserves are reserves expected to 
be recovered through existing wells and facilities under the operating conditions that have been designed for. Undeveloped 
reserves are reserves to be recovered from approved and sanctioned projects and remain so until the wells are drilled, 
completed and production commences which would by then be classified as developed.
 
Estimations of reserves are reviewed annually. These estimates are inherently imprecise, require the application of judgements 
and are subject to regular revision, either upward or downward, based on new information available such as new geological 
information gathered from the drilling of additional wells, observation of long-term reservoir performance under producing 
conditions and changes in economic factors, including product prices, contract terms or development plans. 
 
Such revisions will impact the Group’s and the Company’s reported financial position and results which include:
(i) 
carrying value of oil and gas properties and their corresponding amortisation charges;
(ii) 
carrying value of projects-in-progress;
(iii) 
provisions for decommissioning and restoration; and
(iv) 
carrying value of deferred tax assets/liabilities.

Impairment review of property, plant and equipment
 
As at 31 December 2019, the Group recognised impairment losses on certain property, plant and equipment amounting to 
RM6,539 million (2018: impairment write-back of RM3,532 million). The impairment losses are primarily as a result of lower oil 
and gas price outlook.
 
As at 31 December 2019, the Company recognised net impairment losses on certain property, plant and equipment amounting 
to RM Nil (2018: RM170 million) in cost of revenue.
 
In arriving at the impairment loss amounts, the carrying amount of each impaired cash-generating unit is compared with 
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit. The impairment write-back is limited only to the extent that the asset’s 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, 
if no impairment loss had been recognised.
 
The Group’s and the Company’s recoverable amount for the relevant impaired and previously impaired cash-generating units 
of RM41,193 million (2018: RM32,185 million) and RM Nil (2018: RM Nil) respectively were determined from the value in use 
calculations using cash flow projections and fair value less cost to sell.
 
The Group and the Company use a range of long term assumptions including prices, volumes, margins and costs based on 
past performance and management’s expectations of market development. The projected cash flows were discounted using 
discount rates ranging between 7.5% and 17.4% (2018: 7.5% and 14.0%).

Impairment review of goodwill 
 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units which represent the lowest 
level within the Group and at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
 
In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit (including goodwill) is 
compared with the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less 
costs to sell and value in use. In the absence of any information about the fair value of a cash-generating unit, the value in use 
is deemed to be the recoverable amount. 
 
Included in goodwill is an amount of RM3,987 million (2018: RM3,987 million) arising from the acquisition of PETRONAS 
Lubricants Italy S.p.A Group (“PLI Group”). The recoverable amount of PLI Group unit was based on its value in use and was 
determined with the assistance of an independent valuer. The value in use was determined by using the discounted cash flow 
method based on management’s business plan cash flow projections for 5 financial years from 2020 to 2024, adjusted with an 
estimated terminal value. The cash flow assumes a long term growth rate of Nil (2018: Nil) and is discounted to present value 
using discount rate of between 5.9% and 7.2% (2018: 7.2% and 7.4%).
 
Based on the above, the recoverable amount of the unit was determined to be higher than its carrying amount and therefore, 
no impairment loss was recognised. 
 
The above estimates are sensitive in the following areas:
(i) A decrease of 0.5 percentage point in long term growth rate used would have reduced the recoverable amount by 
approximately RM341 million.
(ii) An increase of 0.5 percentage point in discount rate used would have reduced the recoverable amount by approximately 
RM441 million.
 
The value in use of other remaining goodwill is derived from the respective cash-generating units’ business plan cash flow 
projections, adjusted with an estimated terminal value. The cash flows assumes a long term average growth rate of the 
respective industries those units are engaged in and are discounted to present value using discount rate of 6.9% (2018: 7.6%).
 
Based on the above, the recoverable amount of other goodwill of certain units were determined to be higher than their 
carrying amount, thus no impairment loss was recognised during the year.
a Includes net transfer out to property, plant and equipment of RM531 million and transfer in from assets held for sale of RM18 million.
b Includes reclassification of certain assets from cost to accumulated depreciation of RM35 million.
c Includes transfer out to property, plant and equipment of RM14 million.
d Includes net transfer out to property, plant and equipment of RM608 million and transfer in from assets held for sale of RM75 million.

In the normal course of business, the Group and the Company enter into derivative financial instruments to manage their 
normal business exposures in relation to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including 
management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt, consistent with risk management policies and objectives.
13. 
DERIVATIVE ASSETS/(LIABILITIES) (continued)
 
Certain subsidiaries of the Group adopt hedge accounting whereby hedges meeting the criteria for hedge accounting 
are classified as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instruments is recognised 
directly in equity until the hedged transaction occurs, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the profit or loss. As at 
31 December 2019, the balance recognised under capital reserves in equity amounts to RM73 million (2018: RM15 million). As these 
amounts are not significant to the Group, no further disclosure of hedge accounting is presented in the Group’s financial statements.

In accordance with the provision of Malaysian Finance Act 2018 requirement, the unused tax losses are available for utilisation 
in the next seven years, for which, any excess at the end of the seventh year will be disregarded. Deferred tax assets have not 
been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the subsidiaries can utilise the benefits.
 
Unabsorbed capital allowances and unused investment tax allowances do not expire under current tax legislation.
 
The Group and the Company have unused tax losses carried forward of approximately RM67,502 million (2018: RM67,420 
million) and RM27,044 million (2018: RM25,020 million) respectively, which give rise to the recognised and unrecognised 
deferred tax assets as above.
 
The Group also has unabsorbed capital allowances, unused investment tax allowances and unused reinvestment allowances 
of approximately RM11,288 million (2018: RM10,850 million), RM17,117 million (2018: RM14,274 million) and RM875 million

potential buyer.
 
Land and buildings
 
The fair value of land and buildings has been generally derived using sales comparison approach. Sales price of comparable 
properties in close proximity are adjusted for differences in key attributes such as property size. The most significant input into 
this valuation approach is price per square foot of comparable properties.
 
Plant and equipment, intangible assets, oil and gas properties and other net assets
 
The fair value of plant and equipment, intangible assets, oil and gas properties and other assets are determined based on the 
contracted price agreed with potential purchaser.

The unsecured revolving credits and bank overdrafts are obtained by the subsidiaries and primarily bear interest at rates 
ranging from 1.00% to 7.60% (2018: 1.00% to 5.00%) per annum.
 
In connection with the long term borrowing facility agreements, the Group and the Company have agreed on the following 
significant covenants with the bondholders:
(i) 
not to allow any material indebtedness (the minimum aggregate amount exceeding US$30,000,000 or its equivalent 
in any other currency) for borrowed money of the Company to become due or capable of being declared due before 
its stated maturity, any guarantee of the Company for material indebtedness of any other person is not discharged at 
maturity or when validly called or the Company goes into default;
 
(ii) 
the Company (not including any of its subsidiaries) not to create, incur or have outstanding any mortgage, pledge, 
lien, charge, encumbrance or any other lien upon the whole or any part of its property or assets, present or future 
indebtedness of itself or any other person, unless the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all such secured 
indebtedness (other than indebtedness secured by the liens already in existence) plus attributable debt of the Company 
in respect of sales and leaseback transactions would not exceed 10% of the consolidated net tangible assets;
 
(iii) 
the Company (not including any of its subsidiaries) not to enter into any sale and leaseback transaction, unless the 
attributable debt in respect of such sale and leaseback transaction and all other sale and leaseback transaction plus the 
aggregate outstanding principal amount of indebtedness for borrowed money secured by security interests (other than 
permitted security interests) then outstanding which have not equally and rateably secured the total outstanding would 
not exceed 10% of the Company’s consolidated net tangible assets provided that, within 12 months after such sale and 
leaseback transaction, it applies to the retirement of indebtedness for borrowed money the repayment obligations 
hereunder and which are not secured by any security interest, an amount to the greater of:
• 
the net proceeds of the sale or transfer of the property or other assets which are the subject of such sale and 
leaseback transaction as determined by the Company; or
• 
the fair market value of the property or other assets so leased as determined by the Company;
(iv) 
neither the Company nor PETRONAS Capital Limited (“PCL”), without consent of a majority bondholders may 
consolidate with, or merge into, or sell, transfer, lease or convey substantially all of its assets to any corporation unless 
any successor corporation expressly assumes the obligations of the Company or PCL, as the case may be under the 
Notes and Bonds.

OTHER LONG TERM LIABILITIES AND PROVISIONS (continued)
 
Provision for decommissioning of oil and gas properties and other property, plant and equipment is recognised when there is 
an obligation to abandon a facility or an item of property, plant and equipment and to restore the site on which it is located, 
and when a reasonable estimate of that liability can be made. In the case of provision for decommissioning of oil and gas 
properties, the obligation is stipulated in production sharing contract (“PSC”) as described in note 39. 
 
Included in other long term liabilities of the Group and the Company are amount of abandonment cess payable to the PSC 
Contractors of RM3,143 million and RM9,743 million (2018: RM2,400 million and RM7,077 million) respectively as described in 
note 39.
 
The provision recognised is the present value of the Group’s and the Company’s obligations of the estimated future costs 
determined in accordance with current conditions and requirements. 
 
A corresponding asset of an amount equivalent to the provision is also created. This asset is depreciated in accordance with 
the policy set out in note 2.4. The increase in the present value of the provision for the expected costs due to the passage of 
time is included within finance costs.
 
Most of these removal events are many years in the future and the precise requirements that will have to be met when the 
removal events actually occur are uncertain. Because actual timing and net cash outflows can differ from estimates due to 
changes in laws, regulations, public expectations, technology, prices and conditions, the carrying amounts of provisions, 
together with the interest rate used in discounting the cash flows and inflation rate, are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take 
account of such changes. The interest rate and inflation rate used to determine the obligation as at 31 December 2019 ranges 
from 0.41% to 8.00% (2018: 0.78% to 8.08%) and 1.15% to 4.67% (2018: 1.40% to 3.54%) respectively. Changes in the expected 
future costs are reflected in both the provision and the asset.
 
The movements of provision for decommissioning during the financial year are as follows:

Net changes in provision include foreign exchange gains or losses arising from retranslation of the provision and are adjusted 
against the carrying amount of the corresponding asset accordingly.
 
During the year, the Group and the Company refined the provision for decommissioning of oil and gas properties resulting 
from changes in estimated cash flows. The adjustment was accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimates 
resulting in the following:

REVENUE (continued)
 
Nature of goods and services
 
 
Sales of oil and gas products
 
Revenue from sales of oil and gas products namely petroleum products, crude oil and condensates, liquefied natural gas, 
natural gas, processed gas and petrochemicals is recognised when control of the goods has transferred to the customers. 
Depending on the terms of the contract with the customer, controls transfer either upon delivery of the goods to a location 
specified by the customers or upon delivery of the goods on board vessels or tankers for onward delivery to the customers. 
There is no significant financing element present as the Group’s and the Company’s sales of oil and gas products are made 
either on cash or credit terms as per the industry practices.
 
Construction contracts
 
Revenue from construction contracts is recognised progressively based on percentage of completion method determined by 
reference to the completion of the physical proportion of contract work to date. The amount receivable from the customers 
is based on agreed milestones as per the terms of the contract.
 
Sales of properties
 
Revenue from sales of properties is recognised when control of the properties has been transferred to the buyer. There is no 
significant financing element present as the Group’s sales of properties are made on credit terms as per the industry practices.
 
Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations 
 
 
The Group and the Company entered into long term contracts for the sales of various oil and gas products with remaining 
tenures ranging between 2 to 20 years. The future revenue of the Group and of the Company is dependent on the prevailing 
market price, exchange rate on the transaction date as well as production volume, which is based on contractual requirements.
 
In addition to the above, the Group and the Company entered into spot and short term contracts for the sales of various oil 
and gas products with remaining tenures less than 1 year. 
 
The Group also entered into long term construction contracts. As at 31 December 2019, total outstanding performance 
obligations is not significant to the Group. Hence, no further disclosure is presented in the Group’s financial statements.

The legal suit brought against the Company by the Kelantan State Government in 2010 in respect of payment of

Government and PETRONAS has been withdrawn by the Kelantan State Government without liberty to file afresh.
(ii) 
In 2019, the State of Sarawak brought a legal suit against PETRONAS in the Kuching High Court, alleging that PETRONAS 
has failed to make payments of RM1,345 million for the state sales tax imposed on petroleum products including 
interests and penalties under the Sarawak Sales Tax Ordinance 1998 (as amended in 2018). In response, PETRONAS has 
filed a judicial review to challenge the jurisdiction of the State of Sarawak over the imposition of sales tax for petroleum 
products. At the same time, PETRONAS had filed a defence against the civil suit and a stay of proceedings of the civil 
suit pending the disposal of the judicial review and determination of certain points of law to the Federal Court. Pending 
the above, the two cases are proceeding in parallel and PETRONAS has been advised by its solicitors that PETRONAS 
has a meritorious defence to the claim.
 
Financial guarantee
 
 
The Group and the Company provide financial guarantees to banks in respect of banking facilities granted to certain subsidiaries, 
joint ventures and associates (“Group entities”). The Group and the Company monitor on an ongoing basis, the results of the 
Group entities and repayments made by the Group entities.
 
Details of financial guarantees are included in note 40. 
 
Other guarantees
 
Other than those disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements, the Group and the Company had entered into agreements 
which may include agreements to provide guarantees to third parties for the benefit of subsidiaries, associates and joint 
ventures (“Guaranteed Entities”). Such unsecured guarantees are normally provided in support of the Guaranteed Entities’ 
normal and on-going business requirements, consistent with generally acceptable and recognised industry practices. The 
liability of the Group and the Company is therefore contingent and would only trigger upon the default of the Guaranteed 
Entities’ obligation under the guarantee.

OPERATING SEGMENTS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION
 
During the financial year, the Group has undertaken reorganisation resulting in the change in the way of certain activities are 
managed. The Group’s reportable operating segments now comprise Upstream, Gas and New Energy, and Downstream. 
Accordingly, the Group has restated the operating segment information for the prior period.
 
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments:
• 
Upstream - activities include oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, together with related 
pipeline and transportation activities.
• 
Gas and New Energy - activities include purchase of natural gas from Upstream, liquefaction and processing of natural 
gas, marketing and trading of liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and sales gas as well as power and new energy business.
• 
Downstream - activities include the supply and trading, refining, manufacturing, marketing and transportation of crude 
oil, petroleum and petrochemical products. 
 
Corporate and others comprise primarily logistic and maritime segment, property segment and central treasury and project 
delivery and technology function. 
 
For each of the reportable segment, the Group chief operating decision maker, which in this case is the PETRONAS Executive 
Leadership Team, reviews internal management reports at least on a quarterly basis.
 
There are varying levels of integration between Upstream segment, Gas and New Energy segment, Downstream segment and 
others. This integration includes transfers of products and services between segments. 
 
Inter-segment pricing is established on a commercial basis.
 
Inter-segment revenues include sales of crude oil and condensates, petroleum products, sales gas and shipping services 
between business segments. These transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
 
Performance is measured based on segment profit after tax (“PAT”), as included in the internal management reports. Segment 
PAT is used to measure performance as the Executive Leadership Team  believes that such information is the most relevant in 
evaluating the results of the segments.
 
Segment assets are measured based on total assets (including goodwill) of a segment, as included in the internal management 
reports and are used to measure the return of assets of each segment.
 
Segment liabilities information is neither included in the internal management reports nor provided regularly to the Executive 
Leadership Team. Hence, no disclosure is made on segment liability.
 
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the financial year to acquire non-current assets other than 
financial instruments and deferred tax assets.

PETROLEUM ARRANGEMENTS
 
The Petroleum Development Act, 1974 vests the entire ownership, rights, powers, liberties and privileges of exploiting 
petroleum resources on land and offshore Malaysia in PETRONAS. In addition, the Group via its subsidiaries participated in 
various petroleum arrangements outside Malaysia as contractors.
 
Production sharing contracts (“PSC”)
 
Malaysia
 
The monetisation of petroleum resources is carried out primarily by means of PSCs between PETRONAS, its subsidiaries and 
other oil and gas companies (“PSC Contractors”). Under the terms of the various PSCs, the PSC Contractors shall bear all the 
costs and may recover their costs in barrels of crude oil or gas equivalent in accordance with the terms of their respective 
PSCs.
 
Certain terms of the PSCs are:
(i) 
Research cess, supplemental payments and crude oil or gas entitlement
 
The determination of research cess, supplemental payments, and PETRONAS’ and the PSC Contractors’ entitlements 
to crude oil or gas produced subsequent to 31 December 1992 have been based on the returns submitted by PSC 
Contractors and is dependent on agreement being reached on the method of valuation of crude oil or gas and the 
quantum of costs incurred and claimed by contractors subject to the maximum rate provided under the respective 
PSCs for the year. PETRONAS’ entitlements to crude oil and natural gas are taken up as income on the basis of liftings 
and sales respectively made by the Company.
(ii) 
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
 
Title to all equipment and other assets purchased or acquired by PSC Contractors exclusively for the purpose of 
petroleum operations, and which costs are recoverable in barrels of cost oil or gas equivalent, is vested with PETRONAS. 
However, the values of these assets are not taken up in the financial statements of PETRONAS other than: 
• 
the property, plant and equipment of a subsidiary which is also a contractor to PETRONAS under certain PSCs; 
and
• 
the estimated costs of decommissioning and removing the assets and restoring the site on which they are 
located where there is an obligation to do so.
(iii) 
Inventories
 
Title to all crude oil held in inventories by the PSC Contractors lies with PETRONAS and title to the contractors’ 
entitlement passes only upon delivery at point of export.
(iv) 
Abandonment
 
The PSCs stipulate the rights and obligation of PETRONAS and the PSC Contractors (“PSC Parties”) in relation to the 
abandonment of the oil and gas properties. The PSC Contractors have the obligation to undertake abandonment 
activities during the PSC period except for certain PSCs or facilities where the abandonment obligation lies with 
PETRONAS.
 
In addition, the PSC Contractors are also required to make abandonment cess contribution to Abandonment Cess Fund 
via PETRONAS in accordance with the terms of the PSCs. The PSC Contractors have the rights to request PETRONAS to 
reimburse the abandonment cess up to the cumulative amount paid upon the execution of the abandonment activities.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)
 
Receivables and contract assets (continued)
 
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk (continued)
 
The gross carrying amounts of credit impaired trade receivables and contract assets are written off (either partially or full) 
when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group or the Company determines that 
the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject 
to the write-off. Nevertheless, trade receivables and contract assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement 
activities.
 
Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
 
As at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk arising from trade receivables and contract assets 
are represented by the carrying amounts in the statement of financial position.
 
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt securities at FVOCI 
are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the 
estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.
 
Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:
(i) 
significant financial difficulty of the customer;
(ii) 
a breach of contract such as a default; or
(iii) 
it is probable that the customer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation.
 
Exposure to losses increases with concentrations of credit risk which may exist when a number of counterparties are involved 
in similar activities or operate in the same industry sector or geographical area, which may result in their ability to meet 
contractual obligations being impacted by changes in economic, political or other conditions. The Group’s principal customers 
with which it conducts business are located globally and there is no significant concentration of credit risk at reporting date.
 
Recognition and measurement of impairment loss
 
In managing credit risk of trade receivables and contract assets, the Group manages its debtors and takes appropriate actions 
(including but not limited to legal actions) to recover long overdue balances. 
 
The Group performs credit rating assessment of all its counterparties in order to measure Expected Credit Loss (“ECL”) of 
trade receivables for all segments using the PETRONAS Credit Risk Rating system. This credit rating assessment considers 
quantitative assessment using the counterparties’ financial statements or a qualitative assessment of the counterparties which 
includes but is not limited to their reputation, competitive position, industry and geopolitical outlook. 
 
In determining the ECL, the probability of default assigned to each counterparty is based on their individual credit rating. This 
probability of default is derived by benchmarking against available third party and market information, which also incorporates 
forward looking information.
 
Loss given default is the assumption of the proportion of financial asset that cannot be recovered by conversion of collateral 
to cash or by legal process, and is assessed based on the Group’s and the Company’s historical experience.
40. 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)
 
Financial risk management 
 
As an integrated oil and gas company, the Group and the Company are exposed to various risks that are particular to its core 
business of Upstream and Downstream operations. These risks, which arise in the normal course of the Group’s and of the 
Company’s business, comprise credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk relating to interest rates, foreign currency exchange 
rates, equity prices and commodity prices.
 
The Group has policies and guidelines in place that sets the foundation for a consistent approach towards establishing an 
effective financial risk management across the PETRONAS Group.
 
Risk taking activities are undertaken within acceptable level of risk or risk appetite, whereby the risk appetite level reflects 
business considerations and capacity to assume such risks. The risk appetite is established at Board level, where relevant, 
based on defined methodology and translated into operational thresholds.
 
The Group’s and the Company’s goal in risk management are to ensure that the management understands, measures and 
monitors the various risks that arise in connection with their operations. Policies and guidelines have been developed to 
identify, analyse, appraise and monitor the dynamic risks facing the Group and the Company. Based on this assessment, each 
business unit adopts appropriate measures to mitigate these risks in accordance with the business unit’s view of the balance 
between risk and reward.
 
Credit risk
 
Credit risk is the potential exposure of the Group and of the Company to losses in the event of non-performance by 
counterparties. The Group’s and the Company’s exposures to credit risk arise principally from their receivables from 
customers, fund and other investments and financial guarantees given to financial institutions for credit facilities granted to 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. Credit risks are controlled by individual subsidiaries in line with PETRONAS’ policies 
and guidelines.
 
Receivables and contract assets
 
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
 
The Group and the Company minimise credit risk by ensuring that all potential third party counterparties are assessed prior to 
registration and entering into new contracts. Existing third party counterparties are also subject to regular reviews, including 
re-appraisal and approval of granted limits. The creditworthiness of counterparties is assessed based on an analysis of all 
available quantitative and qualitative data regarding business risks and financial standing, together with the review of any 
relevant third party and market information. Reports are prepared and presented to the management that cover the Group’s 
overall credit exposure against limits and securities, exposure by segment and overall quality of the portfolio.
 
Depending on the types of transactions and counterparty creditworthiness, the Group and the Company further mitigate and 
limit risks related to credit by requiring collateral or other credit enhancements such as cash deposits, letter of credit and bank 
guarantees.
 
Management has taken reasonable steps to ensure that receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are stated at their 
realisable values. 
 
At each reporting date, the Group and the Company assess whether any of the trade receivables and contract assets are credit 
impaired.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)
 
Fund and other investments (continued)
 
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts in the statement of financial position.
 
The credit risk on a financial instrument is considered low, if the financial instrument has a low risk of default, the borrower 
has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term and adverse changes in economic and 
business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual 
cash flow obligations. The Company assumes that there is a significant increase in credit risk when it is past due.
 
As at the reporting date, the Group and the Company have invested 99% (2018: 99%) and 100% (2018: 100%) of the investments 
in domestic securities respectively.
 
The fund and other investments are unsecured, however, in view of the sound credit rating of counterparties, management 
does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligation. 
 
Financial guarantees
 
The Group and the Company provide financial guarantees to banks in respect of banking facilities granted to certain subsidiaries, 
joint ventures and associates (“Group entities”). The Group and the Company monitor on an ongoing basis, the results of the 
Group entities and repayments made by the Group entities.
 
During the financial year, the Group’s joint arrangement entities, Pengerang Refining Company Sdn. Bhd. and Pengerang 
Petrochemical Company Sdn. Bhd. (both referred to as “the Borrowers”), have undertaken project financing facilities, under 
an integrated borrowing structure for the repayment of bridge loan facilities and other expenditures. Under the integrated 
borrowing structure, the Borrowers provide cross guarantee to the project financing lenders on each other’s loan. Upon 
failure to pay by a Borrower, the project financing lenders would have primary recourse to that Borrower as well as to the other 
Borrower under the cross-guarantee.
 
The Group’s share of maximum exposure to credit risk relating to the cross-guarantee provided by the joint operation company 
to the joint venture amounts to RM16,897 million which represents the outstanding loans of the joint venture as at financial 
year end.  Similarly, the cross-guarantee provided by the joint venture to the Group’s joint operation company as at financial 
year end is RM1,875 million, being the Group’s share in the joint operation company. The Group’s share of maximum exposure 
to credit risk in the previous financial year amounted to RM16,578 million which represents the outstanding banking facility of 
the joint venture company. 
 
The maximum exposure to credit risk for the Company amounted to RM2,314 million (2018: RM18,642 million), which 
represents the outstanding banking facilities of the Group entities as at reporting date. As at reporting date, there was no 
indication that any entities would default on repayment. The fair value of the financial guarantee recognised is disclosed in 
note 24.
 
Liquidity risk
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The 
Group’s and the Company’s exposure to liquidity risk arises principally from its trade and other payables, and  borrowings. In 
managing its liquidity risk, the Group and the Company maintains sufficient cash and liquid marketable assets. The Company’s 
current credit rating enables it to access banking facilities in excess of current and immediate future requirements of the 
Group and of the Company. The Group’s and the Company’s borrowing power is not limited by its Articles of Association. 
However, certain covenants included in agreements impose limited restrictions on some of the debt level of PETRONAS’ 
subsidiaries.

Market risk (continued)
 
Foreign exchange risk (continued)
 
The Group’s and the Company’s foreign exchange management policy are to minimise economic and significant transactional 
exposures arising from currency movements. The Group coordinates the handling of foreign exchange risks centrally typically 
by matching receipts and payments for the same currency. For major capital projects, the Group performs assessment of 
potential foreign exchange risk exposure at the investment decision phase to determine the appropriate foreign exchange 
risk management strategy. Residual net positions are actively managed and monitored against prescribed policies and control 
procedures. When deemed necessary and appropriate, the Group will enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge and 
minimise its exposures to the foreign currency movements.
 
The Group’s and the Company’s significant exposure to foreign currency risk, based on carrying amounts as at the reporting 
date is as follows:

Market risk
 
Market risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from change in market prices and their impact on the performance of the business. 
The market price changes that the Group and the Company are exposed to include interest rates, foreign currency exchange 
rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other indices that could affect the value of the Group’s and the Company’s financial 
assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.
 
Interest rate risk
 
The Group’s and the Company’s investments in fixed rate debt securities and fixed rate borrowings are exposed to a risk 
of change in their fair values due to changes in interest rates. The Group’s variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of 
change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates. Investments in equity securities and short term receivables and payables 
are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.
 
All interest rate exposures are monitored and managed proactively in line with PETRONAS’ policies and guidelines. The Group 
enters into hedging transactions with respect to interest rate on certain long term borrowings and other debts where necessary 
and appropriate, in accordance with policies and guidelines.
 
The interest rate profile of the Group’s and the Company’s interest-bearing financial instruments based on carrying amount as 
at reporting date is as follows:

Since most of the Group’s and the Company’s financial assets and liabilities are fixed rate instruments measured at amortised 
cost, a change in interest rate is not expected to have material impact on the Group’s and the Company’s profit or loss.
 
The Group has entered into an interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flow risk in relation to the floating interest rate of the 
USD term loan of USD322 million. The interest rate swaps have the same nominal value of USD322 million and is settled every 
quarter, consistent with the interest repayment schedule of the term loan. During the year, a loss of RM27 million (2018: a gain 
of RM11 million) was recognised in equity and no ineffective portion was recognised in the profit or loss that arises from cash 
flow hedge amounts.
 
Foreign exchange risk
 
The Group and the Company are exposed to varying levels of foreign exchange risk when they enter into transactions that are 
not denominated in the respective companies’ functional currencies and when foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities 
are translated at the reporting date. The main underlying economic currencies of the Group’s cash flows are Ringgit Malaysia 
and US dollar.

A depreciation in foreign currency rate above would have had equal but opposite effect, on the basis that all other variables 
remain constant.
 
Equity price risk
 
Equity price risk arises from the Group’s and the Company’s investments in equity securities. Exposures to equity price risk 
are managed in accordance with the Group’s existing policies and guidelines. The Group and the Company monitor the 
equity investments on a portfolio basis and a performance benchmark is established for each investment portfolio giving 
consideration to portfolio objectives and return expectation. All buy and sell decisions are monitored by the Group Treasury 
Division.
 
The Group and the Company also hold equity investments that were previously classified as available-for-sale financial assets 
and these equity investments have been reclassified to FVTPL and FVOCI. Reports on the equity portfolio performance are 
submitted to the Group’s and the Company’s senior management on a regular basis.
 
The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to equity price risk based on carrying amounts as at the reporting date is as follows:

Sensitivity analysis for a given market variable provided in this note, discloses the effect on profit or loss and equity as at 
31 December 2019 assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant market variable had occurred at 31 December 
2019 and been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date to show the effects of reasonably possible changes in 
price on profit or loss and equity to the next annual reporting date. Reasonably possible changes in market variables used in 
the sensitivity analysis are based on implied volatilities, where available, or historical data for equity and commodity prices 
and foreign exchange rates. Reasonably possible changes in interest rates are based on management judgment and historical 
experience.
 
The sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance because the 
Group’s actual exposure to market prices is constantly changing with changes in the Group’s portfolio of among others, 
commodity, debt and foreign currency contracts. Changes in fair values or cash flows based on a variation in a market variable 
cannot be extrapolated because the relationship between the change in market variable and the change in fair value or cash 
flows may not be linear. In addition, the effect of a change in a given market variable is calculated independently of any 
change in another assumption and mitigating actions that would be taken by the Group. In reality, changes in one factor may 
contribute to changes in another, which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities.

A decrease in price based on average change in index rate above would have had equal but opposite effect, on the basis that 
all other variables remain constant.
 
Commodity price risk
 
The Group is exposed to changes in crude oil, gas and petroleum products prices which may affect the value of the Group’s 
assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. To mitigate these exposures from a business perspective, the Group enters into 
various financial instruments. In effecting these transactions, the Group operates within policies, guidelines and procedures 
designed to ensure that risks are minimised. All financial instruments positions are marked-to-market by independent risk 
management department and reported to management for performance monitoring and risk management purposes on a 
daily basis.
 
Since the Group undertakes hedging using commodity derivatives for the majority of its transactions, a change in commodity 
price is not likely to result in a significant impact on the Group’s profit or loss and equity.
 
Fair value information
 
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short term receivables and payables and short term borrowings, reasonably 
approximate their fair values due to the relatively short term nature of these financial instruments.
 
It was not practicable to estimate the fair value of the Group’s investment in unquoted shares due to the lack of comparable 
quoted prices in an active market and the fair value cannot be reliably measured.
 
The following table analyses financial instruments carried at fair value and those not carried at fair value for which fair value is 
disclosed, together with their fair values and carrying amounts shown in the statement of financial position.

Derivatives
 
The calculation of fair value for derivative financial instruments depends on the type of instruments. The fair value of interest rate 
swap agreements are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curve 
over the remaining term of the instrument. The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is based on the fair value 
difference between forward exchange rates and the contracted rate. The fair value of commodity swap and commodity forward 
contracts is based on the fair value difference between market price at the date of measurement and the contracted price.
 
Non-derivative financial instruments
 
Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest 
cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the end of the reporting period. In respect of the liability component of 
convertible notes, the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar liabilities that do not have a conversion option. 
For other borrowings, the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar borrowing arrangements.

AMENDMENTS TO MFRS AND PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED BY MASB
 
Adoption of new and revised pronouncements
 
As of 1 January 2019, the Group and the Company adopted the following pronouncements that have been issued by the MASB 
and are applicable as listed below:
 
Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019
 
MFRS 16 Leases
 
Amendments to MFRS 3 Business Combinations (Annual Improvements 2015-2017 Cycle)
 
Amendments to MFRS 11 Joint Arrangements (Annual Improvements 2015-2017 Cycle)
 
Amendments to MFRS 112 Income Taxes (Annual Improvements 2015-2017 Cycle)
 
Amendments to MFRS 123 Borrowing Costs (Annual Improvements 2015-2017 Cycle)
 
Amendments to MFRS 128 Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures: Long-term Interests in Associates and 
 
Joint Ventures
 
Amendments to MFRS 119 Employee Benefits: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement
 
IC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
 
The principal changes in accounting policies and their effects are set out below:
i. 
MFRS 16 Leases
 
Definition of a lease
 
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of 
time in exchange for a consideration. On transition to MFRS 16, the Group and the Company reassessed all contracts 
to determine whether each contract is, or contains a lease at the date of initial application.  
 
As a lessee
 
MFRS 16 introduces a single, on balance sheet lease accounting for lessees. A lessee recognises a-right-of-use asset 
representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
 
Where the Group and the Company are a lessee, the Group and the Company applied the requirements of MFRS 16 
retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initial application as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained 
earnings at 1 January 2019.
 
At 1 January 2019, for leases that were previously classified as operating lease under MFRS 117, lease liabilities were 
measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the Group entities’ incremental 
borrowing rate as at 1 January 2019. The Group’s and the Company’s weighted-average rate applied is 4.55% and 
4.65% respectively. Right-of-use assets are measured at their carrying amount as if MFRS 16 had been applied since the 
commencement date, discounted using the Group entities’ incremental borrowing rate at 1 January 2019.
 
The Group entities used the following practical expedients when applying MFRS 16 to leases previously classified as 
operating lease under MFRS 117:
- 
applied the exemption not to recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases with less than 12 months of 
lease term as at 1 January 2019;
- 
excluded initial direct costs from measuring the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application; and
- 
used hindsight when determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate the 
lease.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
 
The Group, as an essential part of its capital management strategy, is committed to a policy of financial prudence as outlined 
in the PETRONAS Group Corporate Financial Policy. The Group’s capital structure consists of consolidated equity plus debt, 
defined as the current and long term portions of the Group’s debt. 
 
The objective of the Group’s capital management is to maintain an optimal capital structure and ensure availability of funds 
in order to meet financial obligations, support business growth and maximise shareholders’ value. The Group monitors and 
maintains a prudent level of total debt to total assets ratio so as to enable compliance with all covenants. 
 
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.

AMENDMENTS TO MFRS AND PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED BY MASB (continued)
 
Adoption of new and revised pronouncements (continued)
i. 
MFRS 16 Leases (continued)
 
For leases that were classified as finance lease under MFRS 117, the carrying amounts of the right-of-use asset and 
the lease liability at 1 January 2019 are determined to be the same as the carrying amount of the lease asset and lease 
liability under MFRS 117 immediately before that date.
 
As a lessor
 
An entity of the Group who is an intermediate lessor reassessed the classification of a sublease previously classified as 
an operating lease under MFRS 117 and concluded that the sublease is an operating lease under MFRS 16.
ii. 
Amendments to MFRS 123 Borrowing Costs (Annual Improvements 2015-2017 Cycle)
 
In previous years, borrowing costs relating to specific qualifying assets were capitalised into the cost of the asset. The 
capitalisation of borrowing costs ceased when substantially all activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its 
intended use or sale were completed. Any borrowing costs incurred subsequently were expensed off to profit or loss.
 
Following the amendments, borrowing costs incurred after the completion of the specific qualifying asset are included in 
the pool of general borrowing costs available for capitalisation. Capitalisation rate is determined as the weighted-average 
of the borrowing costs applicable to all borrowings of the Group and the Company outstanding during the period.
 
The change in this accounting policies is applied prospectively.
 
The initial application of the above-mentioned pronouncements did not have any material impact to the financial statements 
of the Group and the Company except as disclosed in note 46.
 
Pronouncements yet in effect

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Petroliam Nasional Berhad, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 
December 2019 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statements 
of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the year then ended, and notes to the 
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, as set out on pages 166 to 318. 
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the 
Company as at 31 December 2019, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance 
with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2016 in Malaysia.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
section of our auditors’ report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and 
Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code 
of Ethics for Professional Accountants (“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the 
By-Laws and the IESBA Code.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
46. 
IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 
Since the Group and the Company applied the requirements of MFRS 16 retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initial 
application at 1 January 2019 and amendments to MFRS 123 prospectively, there are no adjustments made to the prior period 
presented.

Key Audit Matters (continued)
Measurement of provision for decommissioning, dismantling, removal and restoration (“DDRR”)
Refer to note 24 – Other Long Term Liabilities and Provisions.
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The provision outstanding for DDRR of the Group and the 
Company amounts to RM37,070 million (2018: RM35,641 
million) and RM15,740 million (2018: RM16,451 million) (refer 
note 24) respectively as at the end of current financial year, 
which represents 33% (2018: 36%) and 26% (2018: 27%) of the 
Group’s and Company’s non - current liabilities.
The estimation of DDRR provision, especially for assets under 
Upstream operating segment (“Upstream assets”), involves a 
high level of judgment, complex calculations and estimation 
uncertainty.
Furthermore, DDRR activity of the Group and the Company 
especially on Upstream assets is rather preliminary, where 
majority of the assets are still in production stage. As such, 
there is limited historical precedent which the Group and the 
Company can benchmark against on the expected future costs 
to be incurred. These factors increase the degree of complexity 
in estimating the DDRR provision.
The Group reviews the DDRR provision on an annual basis, of 
which key components in the computation include the interest 
rate, inflation rate and expected future costs.
We performed the following audit procedures, among others:
i) 
Assessed the appropriateness of data used in the 
calculation of the DDRR provision to the originating 
source.
ii) 
Evaluated key assumptions used in the DDRR provision 
calculation, among others:
• 
interest and inflation rates – compared to 
information from external sources; and 
• 
expected future costs – compared to costs 
incurred on recent similar transactions.
iii) 
Performed consistency testing on the application of key 
assumptions to respective oil fields.
iv) 
Re-performed the calculation of the DDRR provision for 
mathematical accuracy. 
Based on the above procedures, the measurement of provision 
for DDRR of the Group and the Company are appropriate.
Key Audit Matters (continued)
Impairment of property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) and intangible assets (“IA”)
Refer to note 3 – Property, Plant and Equipment and note 10 – Intangible Assets.
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Group operates in the oil and gas sector which has been 
affected by the continued fluctuation in the oil and gas prices. 
This gives rise to a risk that the carrying amount of the Group’s 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets consisting 
of goodwill, exploration expenditures and other intangible 
assets, especially in the Upstream operating segment might 
exceed their recoverable amount, and therefore the carrying 
amount needs to be impaired.
The Group has estimated the recoverable amount for each cash 
generating unit (“CGU”) by forecasting and discounting future 
cash flows relevant to the CGU. As a result, net impairment loss 
of RM6,539 million (2018: net impairment write-back of RM3,331 
million) for PPE and net impairment loss of RM204 million (2018: 
RM20 million) for IA (refer note 27) were recognised in the 
current financial year.
We have identified the evaluation of the carrying amount of the 
Group’s PPE and IA of RM319,204 million (2018: RM310,385 
million) (refer note 3) and RM26,260 million (2018: RM22,513 
million) (refer note 10) respectively at 31 December 2019 as a 
key audit matter because:
• 
it is material in the consolidated financial statements and 
represents 56% (2018: 52%) of Group’s total assets; and
• 
the estimation of recoverable amounts involves a significant 
degree of judgment exercised and assumptions made by 
the Group. Key judgmental aspects include assumptions 
of oil and gas prices, expenditures, production profile and 
the use of an appropriate discount rate. 
We performed the following audit procedures, among others:
i) 
Considered the appropriateness of Group’s determination 
of CGUs based on our knowledge of the Group’s business 
and its internal reporting.
ii) 
Evaluated key assumptions used in the estimation of 
recoverable amount, among others:
• 
production profile – assessed whether the 
production profile is within the field/reserve lives;
• 
long term outlook of prices – compared to 
information published by external analysts;
• 
expenditures – compared to information included 
in the Group’s approved budget and actual 
historical information; and
• 
discount rate – challenged the appropriateness of 
the discount rate used.
iii) 
Performed stress test over the projected oil price.
iv) 
Reviewed component auditor’s testing on projected 
capital expenditure against actual incurred.
v) 
Considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
about those assumptions to which the outcome of the 
impairment assessment is most sensitive.
Based on the above procedures, the carrying amount of the 
Group’s PPE and IA is appropriate.

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)
• 
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
ability of the Group or of the Company to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of 
the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company 
to cease to continue as a going concern.
• 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including 
the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions 
and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.
• 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the 
Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not 
acted as auditors are disclosed in Appendix I. 
Other Matter
This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in 
Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included 
in the Directors’ Report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors’ report 
thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the Directors’ Report and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the Directors’ 
Report and, in doing so, consider whether the Directors’ Report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group 
and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work 
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the Directors’ Report, we are required to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give 
a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the 
Group and of the Company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, 
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved 
standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we 
exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
• 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control of the Group 
and of the Company. 
• 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the Directors.

manner, PETRONAS has emerged today a stronger, more agile and 
relevant energy and solutions partner.
Resiliently Moving Forward
The year 2020 was one of the most challenging years for the oil and gas industry as the twin shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented 
plunge in oil prices dealt a drastic blow to all. PETRONAS too was not spared from the onslaught and this was reflected in our challenging operational and 
weaker financial performance for the year in review. As we worked swiftly to ensure the resilience of our business, value chain and the energy supply needs 
of national and global customers, the health, safety and well-being of people remained our topmost priority. 
While we did not emerge from 2020 unscathed, we have learnt hard lessons and gained solid insights into what we need to do next to remain relevant as a 
progressive energy and solutions partner in the new normal. As we steadfastly put the building blocks in place from which we will move forward from, we 
are confident that we will continue to chart resilient, sustainable progress.

Our Brand Positioning:
Passionate about Progress
We are PETRONAS
A Progressive Energy and Solutions Partner
PETRONAS’ Statement of Purpose underscores who we are and why we do what we do, today and for the future. It demonstrates 
our passion for harnessing the transformative power of energy for the benefit of all.
Established as the custodian of Malaysia's oil and gas resources in 1974, PETRONAS has since grown by leaps and bounds and 
is today a FORTUNE Global 500 energy company with a presence in over 50 countries. 
Today, the requirement to deliver energy in a responsible and progressive manner has become all the more important. Being 
a conscientious player in the global energy sector, PETRONAS recognises its responsibility to balance out the threat of 
climate change with the mandate to produce affordable and reliable energy in a sustainable manner. This sees us passionately 
facilitating the management of climate change through various interventions, especially the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions across all sectors under our net zero carbon emissions by 2050 or NZCE 2050 aspiration. 
As we commit to meeting the world’s growing energy needs in a responsible and holistic manner, we continue to build a 
resilient portfolio for a sustainable future by leveraging on our Three-Pronged Growth Strategy that entails 
 Maximising Cash Generators, 
 Expanding Core Business and 
 Stepping Out.
 
Having undergone a tumultuous year in 2020, PETRONAS has today emerged a more resilient, more agile and more relevant 
energy and solutions partner. As we steadfastly lay down strong foundations from which to venture forth into the new normal, 
we are confident of making resilient and sustainable progress to enrich lives and nations.

Sustainability Agenda
As part of our sustainability efforts, we have also prioritised seven of the 17 United Nations’ Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) 
which are most relevant to our Sustainability Agenda and the four lenses. These seven priority SDGs align with the PETRONAS 
Group’s business strategies, enable us to leverage our existing efforts and have significant impact on our business groupwide.
As a major energy industry player, we recognise the immense impact that we have in the various spheres of influence that we 
operate in. In line with our efforts to ensure that we maintain the trust of our stakeholders and the wider communities, PETRONAS 
upholds high standards of corporate governance, ethical business practices and transparency. 
Adhering to the Agenda enables PETRONAS to embed corporate sustainability right into the core of our business and map this 
through six Material Topics, namely:
We recognise that we have a responsibility to balance out our economic ambitions with positive social and environmental 
considerations. PETRONAS’ Sustainability Agenda is the compass that guides us as we set out to deliver energy and solutions 
that fuel progress in a responsible manner. As we commit to uphold the Agenda, our actions are guided by four sustainability 
lenses.
Towards Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050)
We are acutely aware of stakeholders’ expectations about climate actions that support the Paris Agreement. Hence, we have taken 
bold steps to embrace a lower-carbon energy future.
In 2020, we set in motion our long-term aspiration of achieving NZCE 2050. With this landmark move, PETRONAS became the 
first oil and gas company in Southeast Asia to adopt this goal. Our NZCE 2050 aspiration underscores our ambition to meet higher 
sustainability goals for the longer term that address stakeholder concerns and support the Paris Agreement.
In addition, it will not only strengthen the momentum of our climate actions but will also ensure that PETRONAS’ businesses 
remain resilient for the long term. It also provides the necessary impetus for us to pursue more climate-friendly solutions and 
opportunities in the broader energy space that will create sustainable new values for the organisation.
To accelerate our move towards NZCE 2050, we have set three short-term sustainability targets derived from PETRONAS’ ongoing 
efforts on the material sustainability and corporate social responsibility fronts that will make the most impact on the environment 
and society. 
Manage Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions
Cap GHG emissions at 49.5 million tonnes of carbon 
dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) for our Malaysia operations 
by 2024. 
Increase the Number of Education Beneficiaries
Reach over 24,000 beneficiaries through education 
programmes cumulatively between 2020 to 2024.
Step up on Clean Energy
Increase renewable energy capacity to 3,000 MW 
by 2024.

PETRONAS' 
Four 
Sustainability 
Lenses
• Operational Excellence
 Grow value potential and continuously optimise operations 
for efficiency gains and compliance with legislation. 
• Low Carbon Energy and Solutions
 Influence energy transition by use of low carbon fuel, 
scaled-up renewables, bioenergy, hydrogen, as well 
as low carbon products and solutions that support a 
circular economy.
• Technology and Innovation
 Stewardship of economically feasible decarbonising 
technology and innovation in line with business priorities.
• Carbon Offset
 Enabling carbon offsetting across businesses that capitalise 
on technology deployment and businesses’ needs to offset 
the remaining Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. 
We have adopted two approaches in our journey to attain NZCE 2050:
This sees us employing the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) 
methodology to estimate the environmental impacts 
(including GHG impacts) occurring along the value chain of 
our products, processes and solutions.
Life Cycle Thinking

This sees us meaningfully participate and affect socio-
economic opportunities through capability building and 
respect for the natural environment. 
Just Transition
2
aspiration is defined as
“balancing the remaining Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG 
emissions from its assets under operational control 
with carbon offsets”.
These carbon offsets can take the form of energy-based 
offsets or forest-based offsets.
Our Short-Term Targets
4 Levers Towards NZCE 2050
Lens 4: Responsible Governance
Safeguard the organisation’s 
commitment through strong 
governance mechanisms and ethical 
business practices.
Lens 1: Continued Value Creation 
Drive long-term business value 
creation through responsible 
investments.
Lens 2: Safeguard the Environment 
Collaboratively reduce environmental 
impact by transitioning to lower 
carbon energy solutions and deploying 
innovative operations and technologies.
Lens 3: Positive Social Impact
Create positive alliances with the 
communities in which we operate by 
protecting and adding value to the 
well-being of employees, partners and 
society.

Sustainability Agenda
PETRONAS’ NZCE 2050 aspiration and roadmap are anchored on a high-
level strategy with the principles of Measure, Reduce and Offset
Balancing the remaining Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from PETRONAS’ assets under operational control with 
carbon offsets.
Definition of Net Zero Carbon Emissions
We are also pursuing low carbon businesses to secure future value pools. The NZCE 2050 mandate will be the catalyst for PETRONAS 
to create new sources of differentiation while according us an operational advantage and competitive returns via more sustainable, 
durable and resilient businesses that will benefit stakeholders, the environment and society as a whole. The aspiration keeps us 
steadfast and the short-term targets keeps us on track in our commitment to minimise the impact of our carbon footprint and 
ultimately strengthen our licence to operate.
To help guide us in our journey towards NZCE 2050, we are currently developing a detailed roadmap that will outline the short 
and mid-term sustainability targets we need to meet to achieve this aspiration. Concurrently, we have aligned our sustainability 
disclosures with international frameworks and standards such as the International Integrated Reporting Council or IIRC’s International 
<IR> Framework and Global Reporting Standards (GRI). We will also be aligning our disclosures with the World Economic Forum’s 
(WEF) Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics and the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures’ (TCFD) recommendations in the 
near future. This will help us progressively measure our performance based on the roadmap, as well as ensure that all our initiatives 
and efforts are fully aligned to global best practices.
As part of our commitment to sustainability, we became an official member of the World Business Council of Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD) and Methane Guiding Principle (MGP) in 2020.

Ensuring We Remain Relevant 
in the New Normal
Dear Stakeholders,
The year in review was undoubtedly one of 
the most testing years for the oil and gas 
industry with the twin shocks of the COVID-19 
pandemic and the oil prices free plunging the 
industry to an unprecedented low.  
As lockdown measures were swiftly implemented 
to stem the tide of the pandemic, economies 
the world over suffered with many coming 
to an abrupt standstill. At the same time, 
an oil price rout amidst a supply 
overhang wreaked further havoc on 
an already despondent industry. 
Like all oil majors, the PETRONAS 
Group felt the full brunt of this 
onslaught with a never-before-
seen contraction in our revenue. 
Through prudent liquidity and 
cost management, PETRONAS 
continued to operate cautiously 
and efficiently. 
Tan Sri Ahmad Nizam Salleh
Chairman
To counter the effects of the energy 
transition combined with the impact of 
the pandemic, PETRONAS is upholding 
its strategies and implementing timely 
mitigation measures while drawing a new 
map of recovery and growth pathways 
with full support from the PETRONAS 
Board. The road ahead will require us to 
move forward with pace, while having 
the resilience to weather this long-
drawn-out storm.
My Board and I are grateful for the 
relentless spirit shown by our people, 
and our partners who pushed through 
this tumultuous time to keep delivering 
energy while churning out value 
through their passion and dedication. 
They worked around stringent standard 
operating procedures (SOPs) and 
constraints to sustain operations in the 
safest possible manner, while stepping 
up to stay true to our Purpose – A 
progressive energy and solutions partner 
enriching lives for a sustainable future. 
The industry was already 
contending with an energy 
mix shifting from a fossil 
fuel dominated to one that 
will see a significant rise 
in cleaner energy sources 
before the pandemic. More 
governments the world over 
and stakeholders are sending 
strong signals on the value of 
sustainability and intensifying 
their shift towards low carbon 
priorities.

Committed to Enriching Lives 
PETRONAS was formed to deliver value 
from the trust bestowed upon us in 
managing the nation’s hydrocarbon 
resources. At a time where lives, lifestyles 
and economic activities are completely 
altered, we remain unwavering in our 
commitment to enrich lives wherever 
we operate. In 2020, PETRONAS staff 
came together to raise a voluntary salary 
contribution of RM6.4 million for ‘Tabung 
COVID-19’ under the National Disaster 
Management Agency (NADMA). This 
was part of our total contribution valued 
at RM50.6 million, which included the 
timely disbursement of medical supplies, 
protective gear and other essentials for 
frontliners and the public in Malaysia as 
well as in our countries of operation. 
In 2020, the Group’s Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) activities fronted 
by Yayasan PETRONAS (the PETRONAS 
Foundation), primarily focused on 
COVID-19 relief efforts, while we 
ensured that other philanthropic efforts 
were proportionately carried out to 
continue delivering value in meaningful 
and scalable ways.
For more details of our Corporate Social 
Responsibility activities, go to the Positive Social 
Impact section on pages 178 to 189.
PETRONAS is also in tune with the 
ambitions and struggles of homegrown 
companies in becoming globally 
competitive, having gone through 
the ups and downs of the oil and gas 
business ourselves. As Malaysia’s national 
oil company (NOC), we have taken it 
upon ourselves to safeguard and shape 
the resilience of the domestic oil and 
gas ecosystem. We collaborate with the 
Ministry of Entrepreneur Development 
and Cooperatives (MEDAC) to champion 
the Vendor Development Programme 
(VDP) which has helped produce four 
listed companies from a total of 99 local 
vendors who have graduated from the 
programme since 1993. A conducive 
environment for emerging Oil and Gas 
Service Equipment (OGSE) vendors 
will not only help them leap into more 
complex areas of the business but also 
enhance their business acumen to 
develop sustainably. 
In 2020, over 200 of our high performing 
vendors received timely support from our 
Vendor Financing Programme and Road 
to Bursa initiatives, which enabled them 
to thrive in challenging circumstances 
and keep the domestic economy flowing 
from their earnings.
With the pandemic precipitating a health 
and economic crisis, the livelihoods 
of lower income groups and small 
businesses have become even more 
vulnerable. Recognising this, in August 
2020, Yayasan PETRONAS announced 
Program MEKAR which aims to elevate 
the socio-economic capacity of 3,400 
low-income (or B40) families over the 
next two years by transforming ideas 
into sustainable businesses to narrow 
income gaps for a more equitable 
society. These families from eight states 
in Malaysia are expected to benefit from 
the MEKAR programme through targeted 
mentoring and training schemes. This is 
in support of the Malaysian government’s 
stimulus packages to “build back better” 
which includes leveraging on the digital 
economy to empower communities 
to overcome economic hardship 
throughout the pandemic.

3,400

families
As one of the world’s 
largest exporters of LNG, 
backed by an integrated 
value chain, customer-
centric solutions and 
strategically located 
global assets, we are in an 
advantageous position to 
meet future gas demand 
which is anticipated 
to come mainly from 
Asia. PETRONAS is 
also supporting the 
formulation of Malaysia’s 
Natural Gas Roadmap, a 
key part of the National 
Energy Policy under the 
12th Malaysia Plan, 2021-
2025.
On the home front, PETRONAS is 
committed to ensure the domestic oil and 
gas ecosystem continues to thrive and 
Malaysia is recognised as a world class 
investment destination. In our five-year 
plans, the bulk of our capital expenditure 
(CAPEX) will be invested domestically. 
With this move, we hope to rejuvenate the 
domestic oil and gas sector, to stimulate 
the recovery of the economy and 
generate growth for the longer term.
We are positioning ourselves to embrace 
a low-carbon energy future via our 
aspiration to achieve net zero carbon 
emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050). It will not 
just be our licence to operate but is also 
integral in supporting our organisation’s 
resilience moving forward. It presents 
opportunities for us to pursue new top 
line and bottom-line value creation and 
ensure the Group’s market valuation 
strengthens over time. 
Our enduring partnerships with 
stakeholders have already taken a new 
turn with the establishment of formidable 
alliances to further grow the value pie for 
our stakeholders. In 2020, PETRONAS 
concluded a historical commercial 
settlement on oil and gas matters in the 
state of Sarawak. The evolution of this 
partnership will see the State having more 
active participation in the management 
of onshore oil and gas resources. It also 
paves the way for our new collaboration 
with Sarawak Energy Berhad (SEB) to 
explore commercial production of green 
hydrogen in meeting the demand for 
global clean energy.
PETRONAS has been an advocate for 
natural gas’ pivotal role as a cleaner, 
more secure and abundant resource for 
the energy transition which will make up 
a quarter of the primary energy mix by 
2040. 
Paving Recovery and Growth Pathways
For PETRONAS, recovery and growth 
go beyond just the confines of business 
and financial returns. We recognise that 
we have a responsibility to balance out 
our economic ambitions with positive 
social and environmental considerations. 
We draw on our strength and ability to 
balance our unique position to fulfill 
our commitment as Malaysia’s NOC as 
well as live up to growing expectations 
in our position as an international oil 
company (IOC). To this end, PETRONAS’ 
Sustainability Agenda is at the heart of all 
our value creation efforts, and this in turn 
is supported by four sustainability lenses. 
The Agenda enables us to remain 
committed to our sustainability endeavours.
PETRONAS will continue to evolve as 
we brace for lower-for-longer oil prices 
and demand for low-carbon energy. The 
Board is fully supportive of the deliberate 
steps and new portfolio objectives that 
will see us pursuing superior performing 
and high value offerings and solutions, 
which are robust and sustainable in the 
long run, while positively contributing 
to society. This will be met through 
strengthening our core by being 
increasingly cost efficient, ensuring active 
portfolio management and accelerating 
our Stepping Out strategy into specialty 
chemicals and renewables such as solar 
and hydrogen. 
This collaboration realises the ideal 
synergy of companies working closely 
with policy makers to move the needle 
in tackling climate change issues in an 
effective and sustainable manner.

Integrity Anchored on Shared Values
At PETRONAS, we believe good governance translates into 
good business. As such, we remain committed to upholding 
high standards of corporate governance as well as applying 
robust risk management and internal control measures to 
our business. These elements are not only helping us ensure 
the delivery of sustainable and long-term business growth, 
they are also safeguarding PETRONAS’ reputation as a 
trustee of the nation’s oil and gas resources while ensuring 
continued shareholder value creation. Business ethics and 
corporate governance are the guardrails that keep our 
organisation on track and in check.
In the course of acting at pace in response to the highly 
challenging environment, individual and organisational 
integrity must be upheld as a way of life and must not be 
compromised at any cost.
PETRONAS practices zero tolerance against bribery and 
corruption and implements global practices to combat such 
acts. We were one of Malaysia’s first companies to obtain 
and have since maintained our International Organization for 
Standardization 37001 certification. We have strengthened 
the tone from top where leaders model the way and speak 
on hard-hitting topics surrounding integrity. The Group 
also makes every effort to roll out compulsory training and 
e-learning programmes on PETRONAS’ guidelines while our 
policies govern business conduct across the Group.
A single assurance platform, the PETRONAS Integrated 
Assurance platform is pervasively used across the Group’s 
operations to prevent and mitigate risks that could impact the 
organisation, including unethical acts of bribery and corruption. 
This is one of our control measures to promote proactive 
self-assessment in regulating one’s own behaviour and actions 
while performing daily work routines, in accordance with the 
PETRONAS Integrity Compliance Framework. 
PETRONAS holds the nation’s hydrocarbon resources in trust, 
and we share the accountability to ensure its well-being, 
while we harness its potential for the benefit of the people 
and the nation. To this end, we will continue to ensure 
individual and organisational integrity becomes a way of life 
at PETRONAS.

Moving Forward amidst a Challenging Outlook
As we embrace a new year, the economic outlook remains 
uncertain and challenging. Evidence points to the acceleration 
of the energy transition, while the impact from the pandemic-
induced demand destruction and oil price rout remains. While 
there has been good progress made on the vaccination front 
and several pockets of recovery are already underway, new 
strains of the COVID-19 virus have caused some countries to 
consider stricter lockdowns. All in all, clouds of uncertainty 
still loom over the horizon as early economic indicators are 
showing the return to pre-pandemic normalcy will only be in 
2022.
remaining resilient amidst the year’s challenges. It is because of 
your perseverance, hard work and team spirit that we were able 
to remain resolute in the face of 2020’s extremely challenging 
operating environment.
I also wish to express my heartfelt appreciation to our valued 
stakeholders, particularly our customers and partners for 
their unwavering support and confidence in PETRONAS. 
My utmost appreciation to the government of Malaysia, the 
state governments and the governments of PETRONAS’ host 
countries for their invaluable cooperation and backing that 
helped us keep our people safe and our businesses operational. 
Over and above, my sincere gratitude to my colleagues on the 
Board for their astute counsel and insights which helped us 
navigate safely through last year’s highly taxing playing field. 
In 2020, we bid farewell to two Directors namely Tan Sri Wan 
Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin, our former President and Group CEO 
who resigned in June 2020, and Encik Ahmad Faris Rabidin, an 
Independent Non-Executive Director who resigned in August 
2020. We thank both gentlemen for their worthy contributions 
to PETRONAS and our nation and wish them every success in 
their future endeavours.
We extend a warm welcome to our three new Independent 
Non-Executive Directors, namely Tan Sri Datin Paduka Zaharah 
Ibrahim, Dato’ Haji Razali Mohd Yusof and Dato’ Hj. Ibrahim 
Hj. Baki, all of whom were appointed on 17 August 2020. 
We certainly look forward to the collective experience and 
expertise as well as the diverse perspectives that they bring to 
the table. 
PETRONAS did not emerge from 2020 unscathed. The year 
taught us some very hard lessons and accorded us solid insights 
into what our next steps should be if we are to remain relevant 
as a progressive energy and solutions partner. As we steadily 
put the building blocks in place and move forward into the 
new normal, I am confident that PETRONAS will once again 
attain credible, sustainable progress. Last but not least, I call 
upon all our stakeholders to move forward together and lend 
PETRONAS their unstinting support. Thank you. 
Tan Sri Ahmad Nizam Salleh
Chairman
Moving forward, PETRONAS maintains 
a cautious outlook for 2021 as the 
events of the past year continue to 
shape the challenges that we see 
today. Our mandate is to ensure that 
future generations inherit a strong and 
sustainable company. We have behind 
us 46 years of impressive growth that 
will drive us to take on the change 
and innovation that have become the 
business norms of today.
If we are to make real progress amidst today’s challenging 
landscape, we must not derail from our efforts of upholding 
the highest levels of integrity and governance. We must also 
stay true to our Shared Values and our accountability for the 
resources we have been entrusted with, to create new value for 
our customers who have given us the opportunity to serve and 
grow; resource owners who have entrusted us to become their 
partner in progress; and the nation for its support in allowing us 
to continue growing as a FORTUNE Global 500 company.
In Appreciation
Many parties helped PETRONAS weather the very challenging 
year that was 2020 and we are indeed grateful for all their 
support and trust. On behalf of the PETRONAS Board of 
Directors, I wish to convey my deep gratitude to Tengku 
Muhammad Taufik, President and Group Chief Executive Officer 
(CEO) of PETRONAS, his Leadership Team, and each and every 
one of our loyal employees for stepping up to the plate and 
Rollout of compulsory 
training and e-learning 
programmes
To this end, Integrity is upheld 
as one of our Shared Values 
alongside Loyalty, Professionalism 
and Cohesiveness to guide and 
drive us forward.

Remaining Steadfast
in Tough Times
Esteemed Stakeholders,
The year 2020 was an exceedingly difficult one 
for the industry. The unprecedented events that 
unfolded saw the industry contending with the 
challenges of the demand destruction brought 
about by the COVID-19 pandemic and fragile oil 
prices, following a sustained rout due to a prolonged 
supply glut. Within the broader energy space, 
the pandemic mercilessly tested the 
vulnerabilities in our current energy 
system. Since then, the push 
towards energy transition has 
become increasingly evident and 
accelerated. In totality, these 
developments have converged, 
forming an undeniable 
imperative requiring 
immediate reforms along 
the whole value chain. In 
short, the historic events of 
2020 forced a Great Reset 
for the industry. 
Tengku Muhammad Taufik
President and Group Chief Executive Officer
Our focus is on becoming a more 
cost-efficient producer, de-risking our 
investments by pursuing opportunities 
that deliver quicker cash returns and 
are less volatile, as well as embarking 
on more innovative solutions while 
pivoting our portfolio. These efforts will 
continue to be driven by a stronger, 
more customer-centric workforce, 
committed towards the pursuit of our 
Three-Pronged Growth Strategy.
Despite the obstacles we faced, the 
PETRONAS Group has responded well 
to cushion the adverse impact of a 
turbulent year. This overview of our 
operational and financial performance is 
a testament to the mettle of our people, 
their appetite to innovate, as well as 
their commitment to working together 
to overcome all odds and progress with 
conviction.
Turning in a Resilient Performance
Before net impairment losses, 
PETRONAS posted a Profit After Tax (PAT) 
of RM10.5 billion for 2020 as compared 
to RM48.8 billion in 2019. Accounting 
for impairments however, the Group 
recorded its first-ever annual Loss After 
Tax (LAT) of RM21.0 billion. What is 
important to note is, the swift, decisive 
and prudent measures undertaken to 
provide PETRONAS with a stronger 
foundation to ensure the resiliency 
and sustainability of its operational and 
financial positions today. 
At the onset of the pandemic in March, 
PETRONAS announced a targeted capital 
investments reduction of 21 per cent and 
operating expenditures reduction of 12 
per cent. The decision was taken after 
careful deliberation to protect groupwide 
profitability while preserving liquidity 
to weather what we anticipated to be 
an extremely volatile period. We also 
remained firm on our cost compression 
and resource optimisation efforts.
As a result, we recorded positive Cash 
Flows from Operating Activities (CFFO) 
of RM40.7 billion in 2020, albeit 55 per 
cent lower than the RM90.8 billion in 
the previous year. The healthy CFFO 
provided comfortable liquidity cover to 
meet the Group’s Capital Investments 
of RM33.4 billion. PETRONAS’ Earnings 
Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and 
Amortisation (EBITDA) remained strong 
at RM55.3 billion. 
This performance allowed PETRONAS to 
continue contributing to our stakeholders 
in the form of cash payments, taxes, 
export duties and dividends.
Amidst these disruptions, we 
have not wavered from our 
priority: to keep our people 
safe. We took immediate 
measures to ensure the 
safety of our 48,000-strong 
workforce, preserve business 
continuity across more 
than 33 countries as well 
as uphold the social well-
being of communities in 
our areas of operation. To 
ensure PETRONAS’ long-term 
survival, the Group embarked 
on deliberate steps to 
strengthen our resilience and 
steer the organisation towards 
a path to recovery.

Responding with Immediate Measures to 2020’s Challenges
When the first hints of the pandemic emerged earlier in the year, the Group had to navigate operational and supply chain 
disruptions, demand disruptions, evolving market conditions and shifting consumer behaviour. We minimised the impact of 
these headwinds on our business by deploying three immediate measures:
Activation of the PETRONAS 
Pandemic Preparedness and 
Response Team (PPRT) and 
Corporate Command Centre (C3) 
– to ensure timely decisions were made 
to safeguard the health and safety of our 
people and to regulate critical cross-
business decisions.
#1
Implementation of Liquidity Plus (L+) 
– to provide steer on groupwide 
liquidity strategies to remain resilient 
while preserving credit metrics at 
Investment Grade.
#2
Rollout of Fast Forward (F2) 
– to shape the organisation post 
COVID-19, in response to the 
complexities of the new normal.
#3
I am pleased to report that PETRONAS’ operations were able to run safely, reliably and efficiently with minimal interruptions 
despite having to address more than 2,000 cumulative COVID-19 cases within the Group at the peak of the pandemic. We 
activated the evacuation of employees who developed COVID-19 symptoms and evacuated as well as redeployed approximately 
1,039 employees, dependents and students from 33 countries. We also ensured digital infrastructure readiness for our more than 
48,000-strong workforce to work remotely and safely during the crisis.
Leveraging Three Deliberate Steps to Ensure Sustainable Growth
As I stated at the outset of this letter, the confluence of events in 2020 forced a Great Reset for the industry which resulted in energy players 
taking a long, hard look at the way we had been doing things. For PETRONAS, it was an impetus for the Group to clearly define our long-
term portfolio objectives so we could take deliberate steps into potential new spaces that will enable us to thrive in the energy transition. We 
recognised new opportunities in pursuing ‘green shoots’ through close collaborations between our Upstream, Gas + New Energy, Downstream 
as well as Project Delivery and Technology (PD&T) business segments that, in our view, could strengthen our resiliency in responding to 
challenging market conditions. 
The year under review saw PETRONAS focusing on three deliberate steps – the first was to act immediately on the levers that were within our 
control, while the other two steps were long-term measures that would steer the organisation through the crisis and ultimately, thrive in the long 
run. The deliberate steps, which were timely tactical interventions to minimise operational impact and preserve value across the Group, entailed:
Moreover, the Group recorded 272.8 million man-hours in 2020 and the 
Fatal Accident Rate (FAR) stood at 1.47 per million man-hours. Major Loss 
of Primary Containment (LOPC) was contained at five incidents, which 
is the lowest rate over the last five-year period. Major Fires recorded 
were sustained at two incidents – an improvement compared to three 
incidents in 2019.
Evacuated and redeployed approximately
1,039 employees, 
dependents and students from
33 countries
Prepared the digital 
infrastructure for over
48,000
employees
to work remotely and safely
I am pleased to report that PETRONAS ensured a safe and sustainable supply of energy to support the requirements of its customers, 
partners and businesses across the globe with strict compliance to our Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE) standards and 
guidelines by local authorities - all this was delivered despite the many vagaries we contended with as a result of the pandemic.
Focused Execution at Pace
This centres on our core engine running efficiently to (i) ensure optimum value from our assets and resources in a better, faster and safer manner, and (ii) enable 
a smoother portfolio review and business pivot where necessary. At the heart of this are two key components, namely cost-to-serve and knowing our customers. 
These are among a few commendable examples of our achievements:
A total of ten discoveries were made in 
2020 comprising seven discoveries which 
contributed to our resource addition namely 
in Malaysia, Suriname as well as Gulf of 
Mexico, USA and Gulf of Mexico, Mexico
10% reduction in Upstream Unit 
Production Cost (UPC) and energy 
optimisation initiatives to improve 
efficiency in reducing UPC for all 
Downstream Plants
600 million standard cubic 
feet per day (MMscfd) 
minimum daily gas offtake 
during Movement Control 
Order (MCO)
Secured 6.5 mtpa LNG supply deals covering 
contract extensions, servicing new customer 
segments via Virtual Pipeline System (VPS) 
and LNG Bunkering Vessel (LBV) solutions, as 
well as entries into new markets 
Achieved an Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) rate of 
90% across Downstream assets, 97% for domestic refinery and 
86.2% for South Africa’s refinery
Achieved an OEE rate of 
96.8% across G+NE
PD&T’s efforts generated RM2.9 billion in cost 
savings realised across the Group
Reshaping Our Portfolio
This allows us to shape a superior performing and high-value portfolio which is robust and sustainable in the long run whilst positively contributing to society.
Established the Portfolio 
Intervention and Transition (PIT) 
team – a multifunctional team with 
best-fit talents to accelerate the 
portfolio review with groupwide 
resilience and sustainability in mind
Introduced new and accessible 
LNG solutions encompassing the 
VPS and LBV solutions
Increased growth in the non-fuel 
retail segment with Setel and 
Makan@Mesra
Close to a 1GW solar 
capacity under operation and 
development in Malaysia, India 
and Dubai
Stepping out through partnerships 
in specialty chemicals to meet the 
increasing demand for gloves, 
pharmaceuticals and hygiene 
products
Venture capital investments in 
technology start-ups for growth 
in industries adjacent to and 
beyond oil and gas namely, 
Braintree Technologies for smart 
farming solutions with PETRONAS 
Chemicals Group Berhad
PETRONAS through its corporate 
venture capital arm, PETRONAS 
Ventures, teamed up with SOLS 
Energy Sdn Bhd to invest in the solar 
photovoltaic (PV) system start-up 
that provides sustainable energy for 
residential and small-to-medium 
enterprise (SME) sectors in Malaysia
Venturing into the commercial 
production of green hydrogen, 
for export to the Far East Asia 
market
These are among the ‘green shoots’ that will expand PETRONAS’ offerings as an energy and solutions partner to fulfil the aspirations of 
consumers and governments for a low-carbon future.
Retooling Our Human Capital Equation
In simple terms, this entails taking a long hard look at how we deploy the talents we already have, expect to recruit or potentially lose through natural attrition, while 
focusing on building new types of capabilities to ensure PETRONAS retains a robust workforce that is equipped to face the energy transition.
This will be absolutely essential as we pivot our strategy to move forward. People are our most valuable assets and PETRONAS remains steadfast in ensuring its 
talents are continuously upskilled. 
83% of 48,679 employees worked 
from home with 47,127 online 
training sessions completed

The deliberate steps of focused execution at pace, reshaping our portfolio mix and retooling our human capital equation enabled 
PETRONAS to weather the challenges of the year in review. As a Group, we will continue to remain focused on preserving value, 
pursuing growth and intensifying our sustainability efforts as we progress forward in our Three-Pronged Growth Strategy.

Strengthening Our Sustainability Agenda 
For the year under review, we continued to make good strides 
forward on the sustainability front in several areas.
As an industry, we have before us the mammoth task of 
balancing the need to decarbonise the energy system while 
ensuring an energy supply that is affordable, secure and 
sustainable. For PETRONAS, our Purpose is to be a progressive 
energy and solutions partner enriching lives for a sustainable 
future. This signals our expansion beyond the traditional oil and 
gas portfolio into the broader energy space, while doing so in a 
way that benefits all.
Moving Forward into 2021 and Beyond
While we made strong strides forward 
in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 in 
2020, we are not quite out of the woods 
yet. With fresh waves of COVID-19 
cases still surging across the world, the 
economic outlook remains uncertain and 
difficult. While we remain hopeful given 
the pockets of recovery we are seeing in 
some parts of the world as vaccination 
programmes are rolled out in earnest, we 
anticipate a weakened growth trajectory 
for the rest of the year - putting 2021 on 
a fragile footing. Amid the ever evolving 
operating environment brought about 
by the pandemic as well as prolonged 
volatility of oil prices, PETRONAS 
is adopting a cautious outlook and 
anticipates that 2021 will be challenging 
all around. 
In ensuring PETRONAS’ ability to weather 
the storm in a resilient and sustainable 
manner, we must implement purposeful 
and laser-focused measures. To this end, 
we must ensure that we are able to be a 
more cost-efficient producer and are in 
a strong position to de-risk our business, 
while delivering more innovative 
solutions to pivot our portfolio. At the 
same time, we must be unrelenting in 
our focus to build a stronger, customer-
centric workforce that is committed 
towards Focused Execution at Pace 
while strengthening our Sustainability 
Agenda. Ultimately, we must ensure 
that PETRONAS is able to continue 
contributing for the long term towards 
the shared prosperity of the nation and 
the industry as a progressive energy and 
solutions partner enriching lives for a 
sustainable future.
Acknowledgements
The year’s resilient performance is due 
to the efforts of many parties whom we 
wish to acknowledge. Permit me to place 
on record my thanks to my immediate 
predecessor, Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee, for 
his many years of dedicated service 
and valuable contribution to the Group. 
Without question, my utmost gratitude is 
only rightly reserved for our diligent and 
dedicated employees whose resilience and 
commitment to excellence saw us through 
a very challenging time. As a result of the 
collective efforts throughout the Group, 
PETRONAS has maintained its position 
as the most valuable ASEAN brand in the 
Brand Finance Global 500 report this year 
and remained in the ninth spot amongst 
the brand valuation consultancy’s listing of 
global oil and gas brands.
I want, in particular, to extend my 
heartfelt appreciation to our Chairman, 
Tan Sri Ahmad Nizam Salleh and all 
members of the PETRONAS Board 
of Directors for their astute insights, 
counsel, and stewardship during this 
difficult and challenging period. My 
sincere thanks to our valued shareholder 
for their confidence and trust in 
PETRONAS, and last but most definitely 
not least, to our loyal business partners, 
vendors and other stakeholders for 
their support and continued belief in 
PETRONAS as their preferred energy and 
solutions partner.
As we move into the new normal, there 
is still much uncertainty about what 
lies ahead. However, with strategic 
imperatives clearly drawn up, a motivated 
workforce whose commitment remains 
undiminished, and the support of a 
shareholder keen to ensure we succeed 
come what may, I am confident we will 
be able to tackle all imminent challenges 
and capitalise on all opportunities that 
the future may bring.

I am pleased to share that the Group 
undertook other initiatives to support 
the local OGSE ecosystem amidst the 
pandemic. These measures included the 
following: 
PETRONAS introduced the 
Contractors’ Special Assistance 
Programme in March 2020 to support 
the local OGSE sector and to minimise 
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic 
and low oil prices on local contractors.
PETRONAS Chemical Group (PCG) 
worked closely with Small and 
Medium Enterprises (SMEs) within 
its supply chain, authorities and 
regulators to ensure business 
continuity was preserved without 
compromising PCG’s value.
I would like to take this opportunity to 
thank all of our industry partners for 
the ongoing support and commitment 
towards these initiatives as we continue 
to collectively face the volatile business 
landscape.
PETRONAS also recognises that 
managing a finite resource logically 
cannot be an infinite venture. For the 
benefit of the nation, we continued 
setting aside funds through this difficult 
period. On that note, regardless of the 
headwinds we faced, PETRONAS fulfilled 
its commitment to contribute to the 
National Trust Fund which stood at 
RM10.4 billion as at 31 December 2020. 
These societal initiatives are driven by 
PETRONAS’ responsibility as Malaysia’s 
national oil company (NOC) to uphold 
the Amanah or Trust given to us to 
manage the nation’s hydrocarbon 
resources for the benefit of the people. 
This is a value that is deeply embedded in 
the organisation.
On the local OGSE front, PETRONAS continues to run its Vendor Development 
Programme (VDP) to nurture local SMEs in the oil and gas services sector. The 
Vendor Financing Programme, with support from local and foreign financial 
institutions, continues to provide assistance to the local OGSE sector and this was 
especially evident during the challenging period last year.
This is part of our holistic approach to sustainability from the 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) perspective. 
Our approach is guided by our four sustainability lenses of 
Continued Value Creation, Safeguard the Environment, Positive 
Social Impact and Responsible Governance.
On this note, I am pleased to share that PETRONAS appointed 
Ms Charlotte Wolff-Bye as Chief Sustainability Officer, 
PETRONAS effective 1 June 2021. With over 20 years’ 
experience, Charlotte is an internationally recognised expert in 
delivering strategies that create positive and sustainable impact 
on society, the economy and environment. She brings to the 
table her in-depth experience and expertise in developing 
and deploying CSR and sustainability strategies across our 
integrated businesses.
We believe her immense experience will add momentum and 
value to PETRONAS’ long-term sustainability journey. To this 
end, we will be developing a clear strategy for the Group to 
execute our NZCE 2050 aspiration, and together ensure we 
prudently navigate the energy transition while delivering the 
necessary portfolio impacts.
It is in this spirit of collaboration that I believe we will be able to 
collectively move the needle towards the goal of NZCE 2050. 
With decisive, deliberate and coordinated action, I am confident 
that the industry will bring forth a sustainable energy equation 
for our shared future.
Contributing to Nation-building Efforts
Despite the turbulent year, we remain fully committed towards 
contributing to the well-being of society through various social 
initiatives. 
The B40 Empowerment Programme for instance, is targeted 
at the agricultural and agro-based industry. Dedicated to 
addressing youth unemployment whilst leaving a positive 
impact on communities through social entrepreneurship, our 
SEEd.Lab initiative forges sustainable solutions to manage 
community pain points and bridge youth employment gaps in 
Malaysia.
In the area of Education, we awarded 370 scholarships under 
the PETRONAS Education Sponsorship Programme in 2020, 
which brings the total number of beneficiaries to more than 
37,000 students since 1975, with investments in human capital 
totalling more than RM3.3 billion. We also contributed to the 
Discover PETRONAS @ Schools and Vocational Institution 
Sponsorship and Training Assistance (VISTA) programme.
To date, PETRONAS has intensified its efforts through 
partnerships with the private and public sectors to accelerate 
sustainable industry practices globally and in Malaysia. The 
year’s milestones included the following:
Organised the second Malaysia Energy Roundtable 
in partnership with the World Economic Forum 
(WEF) to facilitate public-private discussion on the 
future of Malaysia’s energy landscape and the priorities 
for an effective energy transition.
Attained membership in the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (WBSCD) 
to collaborate with oil and gas industry peers, as well 
as the wider energy industry and other sectors, to 
share best practices, advocate and support policies, 
while developing solutions. PETRONAS is focusing 
on the Circular Economy where we will expand our 
involvement in areas such as Climate and Energy, 
People and Redefining Value via the WBCSD.
Became a signatory to the WEF Stakeholder 
Capitalism Metrics which aims to promote and 
steer convergence of global ESG standards.
PETRONAS recognises that 
sustainability is no longer optional - 
going forward, it is our licence 
to operate. Demonstrating this 
commitment, we have recently 
declared our aspiration to achieve 
net zero carbon emissions by 2050 
(NZCE 2050).

The year 2020 was an unprecedented year 
globally. In the energy industry, all players 
were severely impacted by the twin shocks 
of plummeting oil prices and induced 
demand erosion resulting from the collapse 
of the OPEC+ alliance and the effects of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Against this backdrop, 
the PETRONAS Group took several decisive 
and prudent measures to ensure the resiliency 
and sustainability of our businesses. We 
swiftly implemented several tactical 
interventions across the Group 
to preserve value and minimise 
interruptions, focusing our efforts 
on maintaining disciplined capital 
and operational spending as well 
as preserving liquidity. As a result, 
PETRONAS was able to turn in a 
commendable performance in 
financial year 2020 (FY2020).
Letter from the Executive Vice President and Group Chief Financial Officer

The Financial Year in Review
Owing to the focused execution of our operational and financial 
measures, the Group managed to turn in a Profit After Tax 
(PAT) excluding net impairment losses of RM10.5 billion during 
the financial year despite operating in a challenging business 
environment, on the back of lower revenue realised partially offset 
with lower costs incurred.
Lower revenue recorded of RM178.7 billion against RM240.3 
billion in the previous year was largely attributed to the 
plummeting commodity prices coupled with demand disruption, 
which led to lower sales volume from gas, petroleum products 
and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG).
Following the downward revision in the commodity price outlook, 
further compounded by the accelerated pace of energy transition, 
most oil and gas companies including PETRONAS, have taken 
significant impairment loss provisions on their assets. In FY2020, 
a total of RM31.5 billion net impairment losses-after-tax was 
recognised, resulting in the Group reporting a Loss After Tax 
(LAT) of RM21.0 billion as compared to a PAT of RM40.5 billion in 
FY2019.
Despite the LAT registered, PETRONAS continued to maintain solid 
financial metrics. Our Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation 
and Amortisation (EBITDA) remained strong at RM55.3 billion, albeit 
lower than the previous year’s RM96.3 billion.
PETRONAS was also persistent in delivering positive Cash Flows 
from Operations (CFFO) amounting to RM40.7 billion, although 
lower by 55 per cent as compared to the previous year. This 
higlights our commendable performance given the gravity of the 
situation and reflects PETRONAS’ effective management of our 
integrated business.
PETRONAS continues to benchmark itself against other 
international oil majors who also experienced the same 
challenges and adverse financial and operational impact. Given 
our prudent financial management, PETRONAS’ financial position 
continues to outperform other oil majors. This was attested by the 
Group’s strong CFFO margin of 23 per cent as well as our ability 
to sustain a unique net cash position of RM52.1 billion which 
placed us in a forefront position as compared to other oil majors.

PETRONAS Deliberate Efforts to Withstand the Impact 
from the Unprecedented Twin Shocks
The collapse of the OPEC+ alliance, COVID-19 pandemic 
outbreak and energy market imbalances have profoundly 
affected global energy demand and oil prices. As a response 
to these challenges, PETRONAS swiftly undertook deliberate 
efforts which included:
Prudent Financial Management
PETRONAS’ financial position in FY2020 remained healthy, 
with total assets standing at RM574.1 billion as at 31 
December 2020, a RM48.3 billion or 8 per cent decrease 
from RM622.4 billion as at 31 December 2019, mainly 
attributed to the significant net impairment losses on assets 
recognised during the year.
Outlook
Under the current COVID-19 pandemic environment, the outlook for the oil and gas industry remains uncertain and 
challenging with the expectation of a tentative and modest recovery in demand and prices for products. Nevertheless, we 
remain confident that our efforts and continued focus on commercial and operational excellence while preserving healthy 
levels of liquidity, will ensure the sustainability of PETRONAS’ businesses.
To ensure we have the financial means to move forward effectively and grow in a sustainable manner, we will set our sights 
on strengthening liquidity and working capital management, enhancing commercial excellence, plugging value leakages 
along the integrated value chain as well as supporting the Group’s Sustainability Agenda.

As an integrated oil and gas company, the Group and the Company are exposed to various risks that are particular to our 
core business of Upstream, G+NE and Downstream operations. These risks, which arise in the normal course of the Group’s 
and of the Company’s business, comprise credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk relating to interest rates, foreign currency 
exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices.
With regard to financial risks, PETRONAS has established guardrails as part of the measures to manage the abovementioned 
risks. These guardrails include the establishment of liquidity buffers to manage operational and market disruptions whilst 
ensuring operational sustainability; determining predefined borrowing levels within an acceptable affordability threshold; as 
well as advocating natural hedging practices for exposure, where permissible, while managing residual exposure.
Credit Rating
PETRONAS’ credit ratings remain strong at A2, A- and BBB+ as affirmed by Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Fitch 
respectively. Our standalone credit profile is four notches above our credit ratings as assessed by S&P and Fitch. Notably, the 
standalone credit profile was reaffirmed by S&P despite their actions to revise the Oil and Gas exploration and production 
(E&P) industry risk, from “intermediate” to “moderately high” risk, due to increasing risk from energy transition that has cast 
uncertainty over the supply and demand of fossil fuels. These ratings bear testimony to PETRONAS’ robust financial strength 
and solid business fundamentals, which bolster our ability to adapt to and remain resilient amidst the new normal for the 
industry and market.
Contributions to Governments
PETRONAS’ contributions to the Federal Government of Malaysia and state governments for the year ended 31 December 
2020 amounted to RM61.2 billion, lower by RM23.4 billion compared with FY2019.
These efforts positively cushioned the adverse macroeconomic 
impact on the Group’s financials with lower costs incurred 
during the year. The Group also successfully exceeded the 
spending reduction targets set in March 2020 which was to 
reduce our operating expenditure and capital investments by 
12 per cent and 21 per cent respectively.

Given the uncertainties relating to the year’s macroeconomic 
challenges, we maintained a cautious financial approach 
in making capital investment decisions in order to preserve 
PETRONAS’ business liquidity.
FY2020 saw our spending on capital investments drop to 
RM33.4 billion from RM47.8 billion in the previous year. 
Of this amount, 52 per cent was allocated for domestic 
projects, primarily for the Upstream segment to intensify 
efforts to develop new fields and enhance recovery from 
existing mature fields. CAPEX for our international ventures 
was primarily spent on our LNG business in Canada and our 
shipping arm in the USA. PETRONAS continued to pursue 
strategic capital investments during the year to further 
strengthen our integrated business value chain and ensure 
the future growth of our businesses.

preceding financial year. The movement was mainly 
contributed by a positive CFFO of RM40.7 billion, and a 
healthy cash balance carried forward of RM152.2 billion, 
which bears testimony to the Group’s prudent cash 
management practices.

The World in 2020
The year 2020 will be remembered as one of the most challenging years for people and 
businesses the world over. Oil and gas industry players in particular had to contend with the 
unprecedented double blows stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing national 
lockdowns as well as an oil price rout. The combination of events coming together had an 
adverse effect not only on oil and gas players but also on nations and economies alike.

In the oil sector, Dated Brent averaged USD42 a barrel (bbl) 
in 2020 – a 35 per cent drop from USD64 in 2019. The 
COVID-19 pandemic and an oil price war between Saudi 
Arabia and Russia triggered a massive collapse in prices of 
US crude oil West Texas Intermediate (WTI), which nosedived 
to negative USD37/bbl on 20 April 2020, while Dated Brent 
plunged to a 21-year low of USD13/bbl on 21 April.
In April alone, global lockdowns and travel restrictions 
caused by the pandemic led to demand erosion of 22 million 
barrels per day (bpd) in comparison to the year before. The 
road transport and aviation sectors in particular were deeply 
affected, which consequently led to negative global refining 
margins. The pandemic forced refiners to review their 
operations and that led to the accelerated closure of refineries 
producing up to 2 million bpd in capacity worldwide.
Oil prices improved gradually in the second half of 2020, 
supported by OPEC+’s strong compliance with a historic 
production cut of 9.7 million bpd that was agreed upon in 
April. Tumbling US oil production from a peak of 13 million 
bpd in March, curbed output from Iran and Venezuela due to 
strict US sanctions and optimistic news of COVID-19 vaccine 
rollouts helped support the oil market. However, price upsides 
were capped by lacklustre road transport fuel demand as well 
as an abundance of oil supplies idling in storage facilities on 
both land and sea. 
There was an increase in geopolitical tensions across 
the world due to an escalation of conflicts, coupled with 
new anti-government sentiment as unemployment and 
inadequate healthcare were magnified by the impact of the 
growing COVID-19 pandemic. Massive public unrest such as 
in Iraq heightened security risks around assets and personnel.
Against this backdrop, stakeholder management especially in 
relation to governments and the close monitoring of security 
risks were crucial in ensuring the safety of PETRONAS’ 
business interests. 
Geopolitics
In lessening the impact from the pandemic and the 
ensuing nationwide lockdowns as well as to support the 
livelihood of people and businesses, governments across 
the world announced the introduction of fiscal stimuli at an 
unprecedented speed and scale. More than USD10 trillion of 
fiscal incentives were allocated during the first two months of 
the crisis. For some countries, their response as a percentage of 
Gross Domestic Production (GDP) was nearly 10 times what it 
was during the 2008/2009 crisis.
All in all, the fiscal packages announced over 2020 totalled 
a staggering USD23 trillion. Yet, some 90 per cent of these 
packages were concentrated in developed nations such as 
the US, Europe and Japan, as well as richer countries like 
China. Amid these costly pandemic relief measures and falling 
revenue, global debt reached record-high levels. The World 
Economic Forum (WEF) estimated that total debt touched 
USD277 trillion by the end of 2020, or some 365 per cent of 
2019’s global GDP.
In the first half of 2020, Fitch Ratings had downgrades for 
a record 33 sovereign ratings and placed 40 countries and 
sovereign entities on a ‘negative’ outlook – a sign of the rising 
risk of sovereign debt default. The year 2020 was the year in 
which the global economy plunged into the worst peacetime 
recession in history with all major economies, barring China, 
charting a contraction in total output in the second and third 
quarter of 2020. The widespread nationwide lockdowns caused 
a severe 13.5 per cent contraction in exports year-on-year 
between January and May 2020, while values for April and May 
showed a 25 per cent contraction – a historic low. As new 
COVID-19 cases continued to rise and the reopening of borders 
were stalled, economies had to deal with a long and difficult 
ascent out of the recession.
In November 2020, a total of 15 Asia Pacific nations formed 
the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) 
– the world’s largest free-trade pact. This China-backed deal 
cemented the country’s position in shaping the region’s trade 
rules amid deepening rifts with the US and Australia. China’s 
trade war against Australia has revealed another side of Beijing’s 
increasingly assertive diplomacy. Canberra has invited the wrath 
of Beijing as the largest country in Australasia called for an 
international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus. China 
continued to tighten the screws on Australia by placing USD40 
billion worth of Australia’s exports at risk.
December 2020 saw China signing another deal, this time 
with the European Union (EU). The China-EU investment deal 
agreed in principle to retain multiple deep carve-outs to protect 
Chinese interests in key sectors, including the automotive, 
aviation, healthcare and telecommunications sectors. For the 
EU, the landmark investment deal with China after seven years 
of talks sought to liberalise trade between Brussels and Beijing.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused disruption to the energy 
sector while accelerating energy transition. Governments 
provided green stimuli to assist in the economic recovery. 
The year also saw a magnitude of companies championing 
net zero carbon emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050) while 
heavy-emitting nations including China and Japan pledged 
carbon neutrality. Renewable energy was supported by 
priority access to grids, low operating costs and additional 
output from newly completed wind and solar projects over 
the past year.

Upstream capital expenditure (CAPEX) in 2020 shrank to its 
lowest level in more than 15 years, as tumbling oil and gas 
prices forced players to cut back on spending and conserve 
cash. Early-stage projects were either cancelled or deferred, 
which will have a long-lasting impact on production in the 
years to come. Players held on to their large and low-cost 
producing assets, ranging from those in Guyana and Brazil to 
the Gulf of Mexico, USA.
Bankruptcies increased in the unconventional oil sector in 
North America while mergers and acquisitions also took place 
as smaller players buckled under the weight of their previous 
debt-fuelled expansion. Larger companies with the financial 
means purchased smaller rivals to access resources and 
improve economies of scale.

For Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), the sanctioning of projects hit 
a record low, with only the 3.2 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) 
Costa Azul development in Mexico taking Final Investment 
Decision (FID). Plans for more than 60 mtpa of FID were put on 
hold by Qatar and developers in the US after Asian spot LNG 
prices tumbled in mid-2020 to the lowest ever amid lockdowns 
and port closures as cargoes were cancelled.
COVID-19 and the oil price rout also had the effect of shrinking petrochemicals demand globally, 
putting pressure on a market that was already in a downcycle and prolonging the downturn for 
another year. As a result, average ethylene prices in Southeast Asia fell to USD698/tonne in 2020, 
lower than the USD860/tonne during the global financial crisis in 2009.

The specialty chemicals segment, the most resilient chemical products segment, was also not spared from the impact of the 
pandemic. This was particularly evident on the oilfield chemical and textile chemical market fronts. However, rising concerns 
on personal hygiene and safety boosted demand for surfactants, nutraceutical ingredients and packaging materials.
In regards to the sustainability initiatives, governments globally acknowledged the growing public demand to implement 
green policies, which include a reduction in plastic waste. Against this backdrop, China unveiled plans to cut the production 
and consumption of single-use plastics by 2025, and the EU said it will impose taxes on plastic packaging waste starting 
2021. Chemical companies are actively collaborating in an effort to reduce plastic waste and single-use plastics while new 
technologies are being tested to accelerate circularity.
The Outlook For 2021
Oil
The path towards sustained oil demand recovery remains fragile. 
Rising new COVID-19 cases, made worse by new strains of the 
virus, have resulted in governments imposing further rounds of 
lockdowns which are deterring travel.
A pervasive rollout of vaccines to the masses starting in the 
second half of 2021 should provide some support for the 
recovery of road transport fuels such as gasoline and gasoil. 
A recovery in the aviation sector is expected to be delayed to 
beyond 2021 as governments continue to implement border 
closures while business travels remain muted due to cost-
cutting measures and the rapid proliferation of virtual Meetings, 
Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE).
LNG prices surged by the end of the year, to 
almost 10 times the price in mid-2020, as 
delays in the resumption of supply after plant 
maintenance and shipping congestion met 
with a surge in demand due to a cold snap in 
China and other parts of Northeast Asia.

Energy
Global capital investment on renewables is expected to return to 
pre-pandemic levels in 2021. The solar photovoltaic (PV) segment 
is set to account for the majority of clean energy capacity additions 
while there is the expectation of an increase in the offshore wind 
segment. Battery storage will be significant as prices decline and 
demand for excess energy to be stored will increase when the sun 
and wind are at their peak, ensuring it can be made available to the 
grid. In terms of alternative sources of energy such as hydrogen, 
we expect to continue seeing more investments, joint ventures and 
large-scale projects announcement being made.
The year 2021 could be a turning point as the US re-joins the Paris 
Agreement and participate in the UN Climate Change Conference 
(COP26), to be held in November 2021 with countries revisiting 
their Nationally Determined Contributions.
Moving forward, host governments will have to compete for a 
smaller pie of investments, forcing them to accept a smaller take 
in return for players’ presence in their countries.
LNG developers are looking to revive plans and take FID for 
projects amid an improved outlook for demand, especially in 
emerging markets. Demand for LNG is forecast to double as 
countries from China to India, and regions including Southeast 
Asia, seek cleaner-burning fuels to meet the rising consumption 
of electricity and to complement it with renewables to meet 
their clean-air goals. The increased competition will force 
suppliers to seek innovative and new technological solutions 
to meet the changing needs of buyers, especially those from 
emerging markets. Greater volatility is expected for LNG spot 
prices in the coming years as weather patterns change and 
sudden policy swings alter supply-demand dynamics.

The global economic outlook for 2021 remains weak as most 
countries are still facing a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases, 
along with the latest strains of the coronavirus that are more 
potent and infectious. The rise in infection rates has pushed the 
governments to re-impose lockdowns to curb the spread, which 
is taking a heavy toll on the economies. In Malaysia, the second 
round of the Movement Control Order (MCO) is expected 
to cost the country RM660 million a day – about a fourth of 
the cost from the first round of lockdown imposed between 
March and May 2020 but still a significant loss to the country’s 
productivity and businesses.
Amid the limited production ability and hoarding of vaccines 
in developed countries, the global growth this year and for 
the medium term will see a disparity between the haves and 
have-nots. The mounting global debt, which has swelled to an 
unprecedented USD277 trillion, will limit the ability of countries 
to borrow further and to widen stimulus to cushion the impact 
of the lingering pandemic. Countries will be forced to wind 
down and eventually withdraw stimulus to prevent a sovereign 
rating downgrade or any default.
Ultimately, economic activities, including demand for oil, oil 
products and chemicals will improve in due course as nations 
gradually open borders and fully shift to the new normal. This 
is expected to take place at the earliest juncture in the fourth 
quarter of 2021 for richer nations and possibly in 2022 or 
beyond for others.
The Economy
Despite the gradual recovery, oil demand in 
2021 is still expected to remain below 
pre-pandemic levels of 100 million bpd. 
In terms of oil supply, the OPEC+ coalition is expected to 
continue managing oil production to drive down oil stocks 
amidst renewed COVID-19 lockdowns. Saudi Arabia’s decision 
in January 2021 to cut another 1 million bpd of its own output 
in February and March highlights its determination to hold 
OPEC+ together and rebalance the market. US crude oil 
production is expected to fall to 11 million bpd in 2021 due to 
rising bankruptcies, lack of access to capital amongst the US 
shale producers, and the need to focus on paying back investors. 
However, as oil prices continue to be sustained above USD55/
bbl, tight oil producers could return to the market.
As a producer, refiner and marketer of oil, PETRONAS needs to 
ensure it is ready to adapt to continuing oil price volatility.

production is

The geopolitical outlook for 2021 will continue to be challenging 
as governments face greater pressure to revitalise their 
economies amid fresh waves of the pandemic and oil prices 
that are only gradually recovering. The pace of vaccine rollouts, 
including in emerging economies, will determine how fast life 
will be able to return to normal and how fast economies will be 
able to recover.
Tensions and power struggles among global and regional powers 
will continue to play out in 2021, as the world rebounds from 
major upheavals in 2020 and experiences the shift in US policies.
Geopolitics
Refiners face an uphill battle running their facilities due to 
uneven demand recovery for transport fuels, challenged by 
robust mega-integrated capacity additions from China and 
the Middle East. On top of this, they have to contend with the 
growing traction for clean alternative fuels to meet NZCE 2050. 
Amidst these developments, PETRONAS will need to adapt 
quickly to the fast-changing landscapes of the refining and 
petroleum products segments.
Upstream
Going into 2021, the capital expenditure for upstream is 
expected to remain at below USD400 billion, less than half the 
peak of the almost USD800 billion recorded in 2014. Due to the 
uncertainties in the oil and gas market, the industry will most 
likely remain reluctant when it comes to loosening their purse 
strings. The oil and gas industry, led by the North American 
unconventional sector, will tap technology in an increasing 
manner to drive cost compression as crude oil prices remain 
volatile. This is set to intensify competition even as demand 
remains weak.
The chemicals industry is showing signs of recovery with demand 
expected to improve significantly, driven by the US and Asia 
Pacific. Stronger consumer confidence and gradual deployment 
of the COVID-19 vaccines will stimulate economic activities 
globally. In the US, the stimulus package approved by the US 
Congress in December 2020 will lead to increased economic 
activities, create jobs, aid businesses and boost consumer 
spending. Robust demand for plastics in the healthcare sector and 
packaging materials driven by online shopping will intensify, if the 
risk of infections from COVID-19 is prolonged.
A return to growth in specialty chemicals is also expected in 
2021, in line with gradual improvements in the global economy. 
However, the rebound of this segment will be less pronounced 
as the impact of the downturn was less severe compared to 
commodity chemicals. In terms of market segment, catalysts 
are projected to register the highest growth in 2021, followed 
by specialty polymers and electronic chemicals, in line with the 
growth in the high-tech sector.
Chemicals
PETRONAS is increasingly pursuing growth in 
specialty chemicals to insulate the company 
from the cyclicality of the commodity 
chemical business and to capture long-term 
market potential. PETRONAS will continue 
to pursue its Sustainability Agenda which will 
continue to gain traction in 2021. 
This will be driven by rising consumer demand for sustainable 
products, growing recognition of the adverse impact of climate 
change and the needs of a growing global population in a 
resource-constrained world. Nature-based solutions and the 
circular economy are the key pathways towards a greener 
chemical industry and will support PETRONAS’ aspiration towards 
achieving NZCE 2050.

Our Materiality Approach: What Matters Most in Creating Sustainable Value
This Report is Framed on Our Material Topics
In ensuring effective management of our value creation efforts over the short, medium and long term, we identify topics that are material or important to our 
stakeholders. We employ a structured approach to pin-point what is most material to us. Consistent with IPIECA/API/IOGP Sustainability reporting guidance 
for oil and gas industry and the Global Reporting Standards Initiatives (GRI), we conduct our Materiality Assessment on a periodic basis to identify Environment, 
Social and Governance issues that are relevant to our stakeholders. The non-financial topics identified are vital for us to measure, monitor and manage its 
performance and the related impacts on society towards sustainable progress.
These include 1) broad scanning of the ecosystem that we operate in and benchmarking by referring to internal and external factors. The external factors 
include peer benchmarking and reference to IPIECA/API/IOGP Sustainability reporting guidance for oil and gas industry (IPIECA) and GRI Standards, 2) 
engagement with relevant stakeholders and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for input and verification, 3) prioritisation of the material topics and material issues, 
and 4) endorsement by the SD and HSSE Council Working Committee. In 2020, revisions were made to the abovementioned standards and guideline. The key 
Material Topics
changes that affect our disclosure in this report are: IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for advancing environment and social performance, 
along with American Petroleum Institute (API), and the international Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP) published the fourth edition of ‘Sustainability reporting 
guidance for oil and gas industry’. On top of this, GRI made effective the revised GRI 303: Water and Effluents (2018), GRI 403: Occupational Health and 
Safety (2018) and GRI 306: Waste (2020). Consequently, the PETRONAS Group undertook a revalidation of our material topics against the updated reporting 
standards and framework. Our findings revealed that our current six material topics remained relevant and valid in addressing the overall industry risks, energy 
transition and stakeholders’ expectations. As part of the Group’s management of Health and Well-Being, we have included disclosures on our COVID-19 
pandemic responses throughout this Integrated Report.
The content below explains how each material topic can impact the Group’s business model and operations. While this list also highlights our responses, 
the SDGs we align with, and which stakeholder groups are affected, it is not an exhaustive listing. The material topics are used to report on the non-financial 
disclosures in this report. Please refer to our ‘Non-Financial Content Index’ on page 228 for a mapping of the locations of information regarding these issues.

Focused Execution at Pace
This calls for us to focus our 
efforts on ensuring our core 
engine runs efficiently to (i) 
keep us going through this very 
tough period, and (ii) to enable 
a smoother portfolio review and 
business pivot where necessary. 
This focus on operational 
excellence aims to ensure that 
we garner optimum value from 
our assets and resources, better, 
faster and safer, with a laser-
focus on process safety. At the 
heart of this, we are bringing 
two key components, namely 
cost-to-serve and knowing your 
customers into play.
Reshaping Our Portfolio
This mandates that we reflect 
on our strategic positioning and 
make preparations to embrace 
the future in a more relevant 
manner. This will enable us to 
shape a superior-performing and 
high-value portfolio, which will 
be robust and sustainable over 
the long run whilst contributing 
to society in a positive manner.
Retooling Our Human Capital 
Equation
This calls for us to build new 
types of capabilities which are 
outside our traditional strengths. 
It involves making enhancements 
to our talent strategies as well 
as redefining our workforce 
ecosystem for talents to create 
value and innovate as we pivot 
our strategy moving forward and 
steer long-term growth.

The AC assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities 
relating to internal controls and financial reporting by 
performing oversight functions on behalf of the Board. 
This is to ensure good governance practices and proper 
conduct while safeguarding the Group’s assets.
Risks Linked to Creating Value
Risks Linked to Creating Value
Preserving Value Through
Effective Risk Management
As an integrated energy player, the PETRONAS Group is exposed to a variety of significant risks that 
can have an impact on our operations, prospects, future performance, financial position, liquidity, 
asset value, growth potential, sustainable development and reputation. To ensure that the Group 
is able to continue creating, preserving and realising value, we are proactively leveraging on an 
effective and comprehensive system of risk management and internal control to mitigate these 
significant risks.
This system, which includes identifying, assessing, responding to and monitoring a range of 
financial and non-financial risks, remains a cornerstone of our business strategy and is fundamental 
to our goal of delivering sustainable long-term value. It is not intended to eliminate risk entirely, 
but instead to manage our risk exposure across our businesses, whilst at the same time making 
the most of any opportunities. This system provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss, or the occurrence of unforeseeable circumstances.
Chart 1: Risk Management
The Group’s Risk Management Framework helps identify and manage risks in a way that is supportive of our strategic priorities 
towards building a successful and sustainable business. Our approach towards risk management is framed by our ongoing 
understanding of the risks that we are exposed to, our risk appetite and how these risks change over time. Risks across the 
Group are being managed on an integrated basis within stipulated and approved Limits of Authority (LOA). Evaluations of 
those risks are incorporated into the decision-making process.
PETRONAS Board
Risk management is one of the core responsibilities of the PETRONAS Board, and is central to the 
decision-making process. The Board is responsible for overseeing and ensuring a sound system of 
risk management and internal control across the Group.
The PETRONAS Board is also responsible for providing risk oversight as well as setting the tone to ensure risk management practices are 
embedded within the Group’s culture and the mindset of its people. As per the requirements of the Companies Act 2016, the Board Charter 
encompasses risk management and internal control oversight as one of the main functions of the Board.
The Board is supported by the Audit Committee and the Risk Committees in carrying out its risk oversight responsibilities:
President and Group Chief Executive Officer, supported by the Executive 
Leadership Team
The President and Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is assisted by the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) in ensuring a holistic approach is 
taken for all business development strategies as well as high-impact and high-value investments including mergers and acquisitions.
The establishment of the ELT is to review key risk management matters and provide guidance and direction to the RC and Board. In 
addition, the ELT undertakes Focused ELT Meetings to discuss specific matters which include Health, Safety, Security and Environment 
(HSSE) and People Development.
Risk Management Committee
(RMC)
The RMC is tasked with assisting the ELT, the RC and the Board in identifying principal risks and reviewing governing 
documents at the corporate level. It also provides assurance on risk management practices across the PETRONAS 
Group to protect and safeguard the Group’s interests. The RMC also promotes sound risk management practices 
through the sharing of information, best practices and lessons learnt to enhance the risk culture across the Group.
Dedicated risk management functions exist within the Group, particularly for listed subsidiaries, to assess and 
evaluate the risk management processes for reporting to their respective Leadership Teams and Board of Directors. 
Internal controls have also been developed to facilitate the standardisation of processes and practices across 
the Group for areas of risk such as Financial, HSSE, Plant and Facilities, Project, Procurement, Digital, Reputation, 
Human Capital and Country.
All employees have a role to play in risk management and internal control. Assurance programmes are conducted regularly 
to ensure compliance with established governing documents and to gauge the effectiveness of the risk management 
implementation processes.
Risk Committee
(RC)
The RC assists the Board in providing, among others, 
direction, guidance and oversight on risk management 
matters. The RC reviews risk policies, strategies, principal 
risks, risk practices and oversees the adequacy of the risk 
management system to effectively monitor and manage risks 
in the Group.

CM (refer Chart 4) is an integrated process that aims to prepare an organisation’s domestic and international operations to 
respond to and manage crises in risk areas to protect People, Environment, Asset and Reputation (PEAR).
Under CM, there is a three-tiered response protocol that demarcates the roles and responsibilities of the emergency site 
management, operating unit management, corporate and internal/external response agencies, and/or authorities. Testing 
and Exercising (T&E) via simulation of test scenarios validates the effectiveness of response strategies as well as promotes 
continuous improvement as identified in the Emergency/Crisis Management Plan. T&E programmes are carried out at the

Risk Policy
The PETRONAS Risk Policy (refer Chart 2) stipulates the general principles and guidelines for actions which influence decisions. 
It clearly communicates the management’s expectations in relation to risk management practices throughout the Group. 
It is complemented by the PETRONAS Resiliency Model that provides an integrated and holistic view of the overall strategy to manage 
the Group’s risks, focusing on three areas of business resilience, namely Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), Crisis Management (CM) 
and Business Continuity Management (BCM). These are supported by the risk management frameworks and the relevant guidelines to 
govern, guide and institutionalise risk management practices across the Group. The status of risk management practices across the 
Group are continuously monitored and reported quarterly to the RMC.
The ERM (refer Chart 3) process is an integral part of managing the business as it provides a guide to systematically identify, 
assess, treat, monitor and review risks. It aims to improve the ability to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of the identified risks 
that may affect the achievement of business objectives.
The risk profiles, which are established through the ERM process are monitored at the corporate level and across the Group, 
consist of identified principal risks with the corresponding risk mitigations and key risk indicators. This allows actions to be taken 
to ensure that risks are being effectively managed by the respective units. Such actions are endorsed by the Heads of Division 
of the respective Holding Company Units (HCUs), Business Units (BUs) or Operating Units (OPUs), and are reported to the 
respective Leadership Teams and Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.
The Group’s Risk Appetite articulates the type of risks that the Group is willing to accept to guide strategic decisions at the 
corporate level in pursuit of business values and objectives. It reflects the Group’s position, propensity and acceptability to take 
risks in various areas, namely strategic, financial, operational, reputational, while maintaining legal and regulatory compliance and 
is defined by the respective area’s tolerances and threshold levels. At the corporate level, the PETRONAS Group’s Risk Appetite is 
monitored and reported on quarterly basis to the ELT, RC and the Board.

Mitigating Key Risks
The Group’s businesses are subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These and other risks, whether known or 
unknown, may have potential material adverse impacts on our operations. The risks set out below are linked to our Three-Pronged Growth 
Strategy and are not an exhaustive list of the challenges that we currently face or may develop in the future. The order in which these risks 
and uncertainties appear does not necessarily reflect the likelihood of their occurrence or the relative magnitude of their potential material 
adverse impact on our business.

There is also a shift in customers’ preferences, 
namely an increased demand for lower carbon 
sources of energy. The shift in customers’ 
preferences and emergence of cleaner sources of 
energy intensifies the competition within the oil and 
gas industry and indirectly affects PETRONAS’ value 
chain.
As PETRONAS’ core business is predominantly in 
oil and gas, our financial performance is highly 
influenced by the volatility of commodity prices, 
which is generally determined by the supply and 
demand in the market. The COVID-19 pandemic 
and movement restrictions imposed globally 
have a substantial impact on the fluctuation in 
commodity prices and customers’ demands.
PETRONAS’ reporting currency is in Ringgit 
Malaysia, however there are transactions dealt 
in the US Dollar which expose the Group to the 
volatility of the US Dollar to Ringgit Malaysia 
exchange rate. Additionally, our presence 
globally has exposed us to the changes in 
the value of other currencies and exchange 
controls imposed by the countries we are in.
Mitigations Conducted
In response to the wide-ranging market risks 
and the corresponding challenge in generating 
values from our business, a thorough review of 
PETRONAS’ portfolio mix is being undertaken, 
with a focus on prioritising resources to the 
areas that are of the highest value to the 
organisation and business whilst meeting the 
expectations of our customers.
Additionally, the PETRONAS Financial Policy 
(PFP) sets the overarching philosophy and 
In addition to the PFP, digital and strategic 
initiatives are outlined to address the integrated

outlines high level principles for PETRONAS to be 
financially resilient for longer-term sustainability 
through efficient capital and liquidity management 
practices, as well as financial risk management 
practices. Relevant Supporting Guidelines are 
also in place to further guide and ensure financial 
management and financial risk management 
practices are implemented. This also enables visibility 
of the Group’s key financial risk exposures for 
improved risk management.
The progress of PETRONAS’ key projects is 
reviewed and monitored regularly, aligned to the 
risk appetite established for project delivery. 
Project risk management is implemented 
in accordance with the PETRONAS Project 
Management System (PPMS), with the objective 
of reducing the risk of unexpected technical 
and/or commercial factors significantly affecting 
the project’s viability. The PPMS Phase Gated 
Process is designed to retain and maximise 
project value across a project’s life cycle from 
the identification of business opportunity until 
operationalisation of the project and to bring a 
measure of rational processes to the decision-
making associated with transforming business 
opportunity into operational assets.
Group Project Delivery (GPD) has oversight 
for all of PETRONAS capital projects, technical 
deployment projects and plant change projects, 
PFRM prescribes the principles and structured 
processes in managing operational risks in 
accordance with the PETRONAS Resiliency 
Model. It guides plants and facilities to 
systematically identify, assess, control, monitor 
and review operational risks to improve the 
ability to reduce the likelihood and/or impact 
of identified risks. The remaining governing 
documents prescribe the specific system and 
work processes required by the Group’s plant 
and facilities over the asset life cycle in order 
to operate safely and achieve the targeted 
reliability, integrity and performance.
Additionally, businesses conduct capability 
development programmes to equip personnel 
with the technical knowledge required. 
Collaborative efforts with peers/partners within 
the oil and gas industry facilitate the transfer of 
technical knowledge to PETRONAS.

plus executes the role of Asset Owner Representative 
where PETRONAS is the major shareholder.
Throughout execution, performance of the projects 
schedule, cost and scope are monitored on a regular 
basis. Emerging risks and early warning signals are 
tracked and mitigated accordingly to protect the 
overall projects’ value. 
The risk management of plant and facilities in 
PETRONAS is governed by various governing 
documents and processes such as the Reliability 
and Integrity Management Systems (RIMS), PMMS 
Guideline, Plant and Facilities Risk Management 
(PFRM) Guideline, PETRONAS Technical Standard 
(PTS), PETRONAS Basic Technical Requirement 
(PBTR) and PETRONAS Technical Guideline (PTG). 
These governing documents and work processes 
outline the requirements to ensure proper 
management of operational risk and safe operations 
of the assets.
Execution 
Risk
Our business, financial performance and results of operations are dependent on the successful delivery of complex, long-term, 
capital-intensive projects, as well as asset portfolio optimisation. Consequently, insufficient insurance coverage could have 
material adverse impact on PETRONAS’ fiscal bottom line.
The establishment of relevant governance, 
compliance and legal frameworks and the 
PETRONAS Code of Conduct is central to 
managing legal and regulatory risks.
The Legal Compliance Framework (LCF) is 
developed to serve as a control oversight and 
measure of legal compliance for the Group. The 
foundation of the LCF is based on five critical 
legal areas, posing an enterprise risk to the

compliance with legal and regulatory measures 
and has no tolerance for non-compliance 
with legal and regulatory measures and acts of 
bribery and corruption.
As PETRONAS aspires to achieve net zero carbon 
emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050), the Group’s 
Sustainability Agenda will support our efforts to 
reduce carbon emissions and better manage

Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation and 
dispute resolution process, the resolution of any 
particular legal proceeding or dispute may have 
adverse material impact on PETRONAS’ business 
operations, results of operations and/or financial

Additionally, within PETRONAS’ approximately 
more than 48,000 strong workforce, limited 
awareness and misaligned incentives can lead to 
intentional or unintentional non-compliance with 
laws and regulations by personnel, which is beyond 
As a multinational corporation, PETRONAS is 
subject to compliance with the wide-ranging 
legal and regulatory requirements that are unique 
to each country that we operate in. These include 
critical legal areas such as international sanctions, 
antitrust, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-
money laundering and data protection laws with 
extraterritorial effect.
PETRONAS is exposed to various claims, suits 
and legal proceedings that could involve 
shareholders, labour, intellectual property, tax and 
other matters. The disputes and legal proceedings 
that PETRONAS may be involved in are often 
PETRONAS’ control. The impact of these 
actions may go beyond personal liability and 
could have a wider impact on the organisation.
Rising concerns over climate change could lead 
to additional legal and regulatory measures and 
add on to our compliance obligations including 
higher compliancy costs. The nature of oil and 
gas operations exposes us to potential claims 
and suits by environmental and legal authorities 
as well as communities on issues pertaining to 
carbon emissions, waste materials, as well as 
commissioning and decommissioning activities 
of our operations.
Mitigations Conducted
PETRONAS via Group Legal conducts regular 
communications, awareness sessions and training 
programmes on the critical legal areas and specific 
laws affecting the respective entities to enhance

legal and regulatory requirements. 
The state of compliance by the workforce and 
business is reviewed and monitored regularly, in

compliance with critical laws and anti-corruption 
Context of Risk (Implications on PETRONAS)
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and movement 
restriction orders globally have to a certain extent 
resulted in business interruptions, deterioration of 
financial performance resulting from adverse market 
impact, as well as affected our people. 
Any occurrence of incidents during the 
operations of our business could result in injury 
or loss of life, environmental damage, resulting 
in rectification costs, equipment damage and 
damage to PETRONAS’ facilities. A shutdown of 
the affected facilities could disrupt PETRONAS’ 
production and increase its production costs.
Security threats such as acts of terrorism, 
piracy and kidnapping may adversely affect 
our business operations, the safety of our 
people and assets as well as do damage to the 
environment.
The Group’s Health, Safety, Security and 
Environment (HSSE) policy is supported by the 
HSSE Management System (HSSE MS) and the 
HSSE Mandatory Control Framework (MCF), 
which includes clear requirements for health, 
operational and process safety, as well as 
the environment for consistent and effective 
groupwide implementation.
Additionally, the PETRONAS Security Policy is 
supported by the Security Management System 
(SeMS) with Minimum Mandatory Security

The Corporate Command Centre (C3) taskforce 
was established with the mandate to monitor 
the impact of the pandemic and prolonged 
low oil prices on the business, as well as to 
ensure overall coordination and monitoring of 
the response across PETRONAS. The taskforce 
comprises senior representatives from all 
Business Units and selected Corporate Units 
namely PD&T, Procurement, HSSE, Security and 
Crisis Management, HRM, Finance, Risk, Legal, 
Group Digital, Communications and Corporate 
Strategy. Their key objectives are to make 
critical cross-business decisions, ensure there 
is a unified crisis response for the Group, and 
undertake reputation management under crisis.

PETRONAS’ crude oil and natural gas discovered 
resource estimates involve some degree of 
uncertainty and may prove to be incorrect over time 
Future oil and gas production will depend on 
our access to investment opportunities and new 
reserves and resources through exploration, 
success of negotiations with relevant parties 
and acquisitions, as well as development and 
application of new technologies to existing 
fields. Ineffective management of reserves and 
resources can severely threaten the viability 
or may not accurately reflect actual discovered 
resource levels. The reliability of discovered 
resource estimates depends on the quality and 
quantity of technical and economic data, the 
production performance of the fields and may 
also be subject to revision due to changes in 
published rules and guidance.
The oil and gas reserves and resources are being 
reviewed via the Annual Review of Petroleum 
Resources (ARPR) process.
Ongoing efforts to manage sustainability of 
supply include development of the Carbon 
Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) 
technology for the development of the High CO2

Context of Risk (Implications on PETRONAS)
There could be an adverse material impact on the 
delivery of our strategy and our licence to operate 
if we do not develop the right technologies and 
products, do not have access to such technology 
and products or do not deploy these effectively. If 
we are unable to develop the right technologies 
and products in a timely and cost-effective manner, 
or if we develop technologies and products that 
adversely impact the environment or safety of the 
people, there could be adverse material impact on 
our financial condition and reputation.
Technology and innovation are essential if we 
are to remain competitive in this challenging 
business environment. PETRONAS is dedicated 
to delivering the best solutions for our 
customers and this includes keeping up with 
the latest innovations and technologies within 
the industry. However, the adoption of new 
technologies always comes with an inherent set 
of risks covering adoption, legal and regulatory 
compliance, cyber security exposure and in-
house capabilities.
PETRONAS is subject to fast-evolving risks 
from cyber threats. A breach or failure of our 
digital infrastructure from cyber-attacks could 
result in the loss or misuse of data or sensitive 
information, injury to people, disruption to our 
business and harm to the environment or our 
assets. It could also lead to legal or regulatory 
breaches and legal liability.
PETRONAS drives competitive advantage with 
dynamic in-house research and innovation 
solutions by having an immaculate and unique 
system in place to mitigate and manage risk though 
the PETRONAS Technology Management System 
(PTMS). The PTMS ensures that we develop the 
right technology solutions that meets business 
needs and which are aligned with the current 
challenges and agenda. It curates the value chain 
and ensures focus in technology journey from 
ideation, development, management, deployment 
and optimisation of technology programmes up 
until the commercialisation aspects of individual 
technology.
 
PETRONAS also maintains a strong position in 
mitigation of risk on the Intellectual Property 
(IP) front where we hold over 3,000 IPs ranging 
from patents and trade secrets to copyrights 
and trademarks across different technology

As they got down to the task at hand, the M365 deployment team saw the need to leverage forward planning and agility to ensure a successful rollout under the 
WFH arrangement. They also put in place the necessary guardrails for the seamless adoption of M365 across the Group, including a comprehensive governance 
framework, an adoption plan, and the necessary remedial steps to address common issues. With all the necessary elements in place to mitigate an effective 
transition, the team pressed on with the unprecedented exercise. 
In March 2020, Microsoft Teams was successfully rolled out to all staff, and this was followed by the effective deployment of other M365 services throughout 
2020. All in all, the entire M365 suite of products were successfully deployed across the Group well ahead of the original pre-pandemic deployment schedule. 
Despite the sudden but necessary switch to WFH mode, PETRONAS’ businesses experienced fluid business continuity. Moreover, given the necessary safeguards 
available in the M365 suite that make it a suitable productivity tool for digital workspaces, cyber security risks to the organisation during remote working were 
minimised.
Towards Large-Scale and Accelerated Deployment of M365
The year 2020 was the year the rules of the game changed and business as usual was no longer possible. The year saw PETRONAS leveraging on technology 
and innovation in an even greater manner to ensure we remained competitive. As restrictions were imposed on the number of people allowed at the workplace 
at any one time and Work-from-Home (WFH) mode became necessary and commonplace, we got down to seeing how best to maintain our competitive 
edge. To this end, Microsoft 365 (M365) was identified by PETRONAS as the best transformative tool for the organisation to adopt as it aligned with PETRONAS’ 
overall digital transformation ambitions and accorded users heightened cyber security measures.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the plan was for M365 to be deployed in stages across a 14-month period, beginning with a pilot phase for 4,000 
users. However, given the trend of growing COVID-19 cases at the beginning of 2020, the M365 deployment team foresaw the need for a full-scale WFH 
arrangement to curb infections. As such, the team readjusted the 14-month timeline to ensure full support for all staff during the movement restrictions. As this 
had not been done at such a large scale and in such an accelerated manner, the team faced the risk of a failed migration to the new platform and an ineffective 
transition to WFH mode.

The Upstream business continued to create value and achieve business excellence whilst remaining resilient despite 
the disruptions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and energy demand volatility. Upstream activities in 
Malaysia and internationally were inevitably affected due to the prolonged lockdowns implemented all over the world.
The impact of the challenges was largely hedged by the deliberate steps we undertook to enhance our operational 
performance while keeping costs down. Upstream implemented prudent measures to ensure continued business 
resilience, including reviewing all its activities as well as prioritising and rephasing projects. We also continued to 
focus our efforts on maintaining asset integrity and reliability, whilst ensuring that our customers were optimally 
served.
In addition, we also enhanced our strategies to address future uncertainties which included the implementation of 
innovative technology and digital infrastructure. These continued to fuel the way forward in Upstream, empowering 
our people and redefining the way we work. All this enabled us to capitalise on opportunities, ensure sustainable 
production and carry on operating safely.
We continued to uphold disciplined capital and operational spending as well as preserved liquidity to ensure 
business sustainability for the long term.
The upstream industry is expected to face an increasingly uncertain outlook given the low oil price environment, 
lower spending across the industry, higher costs, finite resources and production gaps as the shift to a low-carbon 
economy picks up pace. Moving forward, the strategies in place to reinvent Upstream will hold us in good stead in 
our aspiration to be a safe, resilient, low cost and low carbon E&P business.
Upstream
The unprecedented events that unfolded in 2020 served 
as the perfect catalyst for Upstream to reinvent itself. 
We continued to deliver results operationally through 
a combination of strategic and decisive measures. This 
was no doubt made possible by the herculean efforts 
of our frontliners despite the challenges they faced. As 
we implemented rigorous measures to reduce costs and 
maintain liquidity, we also strengthened our portfolio 
by encouraging more value-driven exploration and 
development of discovered resources to promote a 
vibrant oil and gas landscape. This was especially true 
in Malaysia. In parallel, bold efforts were undertaken 
within Upstream to support PETRONAS’ Sustainability 
Agenda, including making ground-breaking progress in 
Carbon, Capture and Storage (CCS) as well as emissions 
reduction initiatives.
We are well on our way towards becoming a safe, 
resilient, low cost and low carbon exploration and 
production (E&P) business through value-focused, 
purposeful strategies combined with world class 
execution, anchored on PETRONAS’ integrated business 
model. We are resolutely adopting digitalisation 
and technology in the way we work and deliver 
business excellence. Last but not least, we remain 
uncompromising in our safety endeavours to ensure 
everyone goes home safely.

costs as well as increase productivity and efficiency across 
Upstream’s operations. 
Banking on 
Operational Excellence

The introduction of Upstream’s Operational Excellence Management System (OEMS) 
incorporates a value-driven approach that delivers bespoke solutions in each field to 
ensure safe, reliable, and sustainable operations. This was seen in the Asset Reference 
Plan (ARP), where a holistic long-term asset strategy was established and applied in the 
Samarang Production Sharing Contract (PSC) off the coast of Sabah, offshore Malaysia. This 
has led to the identification of potential value creation of RM519 million over the next five 
years. Of this, RM16.5 million has been earmarked to be realised by the end of 2021. 
Another example is the implementation of the Run-To-End (RTE) operating model in late 
life fields. As of the first quarter of 2021, OEMS successfully implemented the RTE model 
in three fields. This is expected to deliver a potential value creation of over RM40 million 
in the next five years. OEMS continues to set the standard for Upstream’s value-driven 
approach by continuously improving asset management and efficiency.
In line with Upstream’s expansion into the area of intelligent facilities, the Resak platform 
located offshore Kertih in Terengganu is the first platform in Malaysia to pilot remote 
operations with a 30 per cent potential operational expenditure (OPEX) reduction. This 
comes on the back of swift technological advancements in automation, robotics and 
Artificial Intelligence (AI).
In Canada, we continue to gain capital and operational efficiencies through technological 
advancements and cost compression efforts. In 2020, PETRONAS Energy Canada Limited 
(PETRONAS Canada) further refined the updated well design that was implemented in 2018, 
which has over 60 per cent longer lateral sections, as a minimum, and up to 100 per cent 
longer lateral sections than the previous design. As a result, PETRONAS Canada’s wells on 
certain pads were drilled up to 25 per cent faster and completion costs were 15 per cent 
lower than planned for the year.
PETRONAS Canada also completed the construction and commissioning of key 
infrastructure for gas processing plants and compressor stations to support its production 
ramp-up plan over the next five years. This includes the construction of its Town North gas 
plant which was completed in November 2020 with commissioning well underway. Serving 
as its flagship gas plant, this facility will have a processing capacity of 555 million standard 
cubic feet per day (MMscfd) when the third phase is completed (tentatively in 2025). This 
will help us deliver our long-term production commitment for our North Montney venture 
in Canada.
Further improving operational efficiencies in our La Amarga Chica (LAC) block in Argentina, 
we reduced cost per well by 20 per cent. The adoption of longer wells, robust well design 
and High-Density Completion improved our resources and reserves by 13 per cent. The 
accelerated learning experience also helped LAC achieve comparable cost efficiency in just 
one year compared to six to seven years in neighbouring blocks. LAC under PETRONAS 
E&P Argentina S.A. (PEPASA), is on track to be Best-in-Class in unconventional play by 
2025. This coupled with the first crude export deals in collaboration with its partners in 
June–August 2020, cemented PETRONAS’ ability to monetise its unconventional resources 
in the region.
In addition, PETRONAS’ Unconventional Centre of Excellence located in Calgary, Canada, 
continues to enhance our unconventional expertise, refine technical innovations, 
strengthen collaborations and share best practices with our other operating regions that 
have unconventional resources including Argentina, Australia and Oman.
Anchoring on PETRONAS’ Three-Pronged Growth Strategy, Upstream has clear targets 
underpinned by a robust strategy to safely deliver superior performance.

We continuously look at innovative solutions to mitigate any 
potential risks or challenges that may impact the industry. With 
this purpose in mind, we are leveraging technology, digitalisation, 
and data as our differentiator, accelerator and asset respectively, to 
deliver our strategy with pace, while being cost effective and low 
carbon-oriented. As a result, our digitalisation efforts, namely the 
Facilities of the Future programme, is helping us reduce our carbon 
footprint and enhancing safety at offshore platforms, allowing us to 
reduce future OPEX by up to 50 per cent.
Similarly, among Upstream’s new initiatives include incorporating 
virtual inspection and performance testing which have enhanced 
our Process Cycle Efficiency (PCE). This includes Factory 
Acceptance Testing (FAT) which was done online. This has helped 
us to move away from conventional on-site testing at vendor and 
offshore facilities, saving time and costs. Furthermore, our focus 
on intelligent facilities, which includes remote operations such 
as the Resak platform offshore Terengganu, is set to be more 
pervasive across our operations.
Meanwhile, our GHG emissions reduction efforts are focused on 
achieving zero continuous flaring and venting of hydrocarbons 
Upstream
Upstream
which aim to reduce GHG emissions by approximately 
2 million tCO2e per year, and potentially recover about 33 million 
standard cubic feet per day towards the sale of gas.
We are also applying Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in 
our high CO2 fields; and considering Renewable Energy as our 
preferred source of power at platforms. Our focus on CCS 
innovation aims to target further carbon emissions reduction, 
while seeking to expand our portfolio of technologies to create 
value.
The Kasawari CCS project off the coast of Sarawak, offshore 
Malaysia is a strategic project that supports the PETRONAS 
Carbon Commitment (PCC) and GHG emissions reduction efforts. 
We plan to commence the first injection of CO2 by the end of 
2025. Once onstream, the project is expected to reduce CO2 
volume emitted via flaring by 76 million metric tonnes with an 
annual average of 3.7 million metric tonnes per annum (mtpa).
As the energy landscape continues to change, particularly in the 
upstream space, our continuous efforts are focused on making 
our business safe, resilient, low cost and low carbon.

Digitalisation at Upstream
Innovative technologies and digital solutions will continue to be deployed at scale to improve the bottom line across our 
assets and increase the efficiency of our growth engines.
The year 2020 was undoubtedly a year that prompted a 
great reset across all industries, no less in the oil and gas 
industry. For the medium to long term, the upstream industry 
is expected to face an increasingly challenging outlook given 
the low oil price environment, lacklustre spending, higher 
costs, finite resources and production gaps as the shift to 
a low-carbon economy picks up pace. These factors are 
expected to be compounded by the ongoing COVID-19 
pandemic.
Doing More with Less
Upstream CAPEX was lower in 2020 against 2019, mainly due to volatile demand and fluctuating oil prices that affected our 
cashflow. In 2020, we embarked on an extensive cost optimisation exercise on both CAPEX and OPEX to maintain PETRONAS’ 
resilience and competitiveness. We streamlined projects and activities, focused on prudent and efficient operations, and 
implemented technology and digital solutions to bring down costs. On the domestic front, we continued to commit to maintain 
spend to sustain the local oil and gas industry and to spur economic growth in Malaysia amidst the prolonged crisis.

Governance and Disclosure 
(Reserves and Resources)
PETRONAS’ Discovered Reserves and 
Resources framework, governance and 
procedures, known as the PETRONAS 
Reserves and Resources Management 
System (PRrMS), is closely aligned with 
globally recognised industry standards 
that are guided by the Society of 
Petroleum Engineers’ Petroleum 
Resources Management System 
(SPE PRMS). The PRrMS governance 
framework stipulates that PETRONAS’ 
Management can call for a fully 
independent third-party audit at least 
once every four years or more often, in 
the event of any special requirements. 
Annually, PETRONAS’ Reserves and 
Resources department is also required 
to perform independent audits on 
PETRONAS’ hydrocarbon portfolio to 
assess the integrity and robustness of 
PETRONAS’ Reserves and Resources 
as reported in its Annual Review of 
Petroleum Resources (ARPR) to be 
approved by the PETRONAS Executive 
Leadership Team (ELT).
In 2018 and 2019, PETRONAS 
appointed Sproule International Ltd 
(Sproule), a global energy consulting 
firm, as its independent oil and 
gas Reserves auditor, based on a 
competitive bidding process. The 
last independent third-party audit 
was conducted in April 2019, and 
the scope of audit covered by this 
fully independent third-party audit 
included PETRONAS’ Reserves and 
Contingent Resources base and 
the ranges associated with the 
subsurface uncertainties as per the 
ARPR of 1 January 2019, as well as 
the Net Present Value of PETRONAS’ 
total Entitlement of Reserves and 
Contingent Resources as of the same 
date. The following is Sproule’s audit 
opinion in respect of PETRONAS’ 
Reserves and Contingent Resources as 
per the ARPR of 1 January 2019: 
PETRONAS’ estimated volumes came within +/- 0 per cent of Sproule’s estimates 
for 2P and +/- 3 per cent for 2C for the data as at 1 January 2019. These results 
demonstrate the integrity and robustness of PETRONAS’ internally generated 
Reserves and Contingent Resources estimates.
Although no fully independent third-party Reserves audit was conducted in 2020, PETRONAS believes the same 
independence, rigour and standards as applied by third-party auditors were upheld by PETRONAS’ Reserves and Resources 
Department in assuring the integrity and robustness of PETRONAS’ Reserves and Resources estimates as at 1 January 2020 
and 1 January 2021. For example, for the finalisation of the ARPR as at 1 January 2021, a total of 81 fields were audited 
between March and August 2020 by PETRONAS’ Reserves and Resources department, covering approximately 70 per cent 
of the top NPV fields, and approximately 65 per cent of the 2P and 2C fields. These fields span PETRONAS’ operations in 11 
countries (including Malaysia) and 44 contracts.

In 2020, the LNG market was faced with oversupply and unprecedented low prices due to demand destruction. Against 
this backdrop, the Gas + New Energy (G+NE) business leveraged PETRONAS’ robust integrated gas value chain and 
adaptive advantage, to switch from a traditional produce-and-sell approach to a demand-led approach to deliver 
innovative LNG and natural gas solutions. At the same time, we collaborated with our term buyers and provided flexible 
contractual terms, as well as introduced more accessible, affordable and sustainable cleaner energy solutions to our 
customers.
G+NE maintained its LNG sales volume at 33.1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) and achieved an overall Operational 
Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) rate of 96.8 per cent. We also successfully delivered 11,547 cargoes to date, while our 
second floating LNG facility, PFLNG DUA, achieved its Ready for Start-Up (RFSU) milestone.
In Malaysia, PETRONAS Gas Berhad (PGB) went on to achieve top quartile performance in both energy index and 
maintenance costs, as well as sustained world class asset reliability propelled by its four-year strategic roadmap, 301Q99 
Pushing Forward, which was launched in 2019 with clear goals to be achieved every year up to year 2022. In 2020, the 
identified efforts generated a RM97.7 million improvement in PGB’s Profit Before Tax (PBT). On the back of these robust 
financial results, PGB declared total dividends amounting to 127 sen per share for the year (the highest dividend payout in 
the company’s history) which translated into a dividend payout ratio of 125 per cent to its shareholders in 2020.
On the New Energy front and through M+ by PETRONAS, we rolled out rooftop solar solutions for commercial and 
industrial customers such as Lotuss Stores (previously known as TESCO) and for our own sites. Today, we have over 
90-megawatt (MW) solar capacity under development and operation in Malaysia. Internationally, our subsidiary Amplus 
Energy Solutions (Amplus), has secured projects with over 900 MW of solar capacity under operation and development in 
India and Dubai.
In November 2020, G+NE established the Hydrogen business and signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with 
Sarawak Energy Berhad (SEB) to explore the commercial production of green hydrogen. Our venture into hydrogen builds 
upon our experience in extracting blue hydrogen from our facilities as well as our experience as a reliable LNG supplier.
The year also saw the energy transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources gather greater momentum as 
governments reaffirmed their commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050). In response to 
this, G+NE continues to strengthen its position as a one-stop-centre for cleaner energy solutions to meet future demand 
and requirements.
Despite a challenging year in 2020, G+NE successfully 
weathered the storm by implementing agile measures 
to preserve value, optimise production and ensure our 
contractual obligations with our customers were met. 
We leveraged PETRONAS’ integrated gas value chain 
to respond to price volatility and market challenges 
while continuing to expand our market presence. These 
efforts saw us make good progress by way of securing 
new natural gas sales and concluding liquefied natural 
gas (LNG) deals that encompassed contract extensions, 
new customer segments and expansion into new 
markets.
Today, as a reliable provider of cleaner energy solutions, 
G+NE with its expanded portfolio is well positioned 
to respond to the shifting needs of governments 
and customers as they move toward their goal of net 
zero carbon emissions. By tapping our strength as an 
adaptive organisation, we will endeavour to ensure 
long-term value creation for PETRONAS via innovative, 
sustainable and customer-centric solutions in LNG, gas, 
renewable energy and hydrogen.

How We Created Value
Providing a Reliable and Competitive Natural Gas Supply
PETRONAS continues to make the case for natural gas as a crucial component of the global energy mix and LNG as a cleaner 
choice of fuel for our global customers. Natural gas provides clean, secure, reliable and flexible energy to drive the energy 
transition towards a sustainable future. It is also the ideal complementary fuel for renewable energy sources such as solar.
In Malaysia, PETRONAS supports the liberalisation of the gas market in Malaysia through the Third Party Access (TPA) 
mechanism governed by Malaysia’s Energy Commission. Allowing third parties to access gas facilities in the country will 
contribute positively towards market-based pricing and a more competitive gas industry. We will also be pursuing growth 
opportunities leveraging on our integrated industrial park power generation capacity in Malaysia.
In the global LNG space, PETRONAS continues to assure its customers with a reliable supply of cleaner energy 
by leveraging on our global portfolio of assets and various supply nodes located in Malaysia, Egypt, Australia 
and, in the future, Canada. The bedrock of our operations, the PETRONAS LNG Complex (PLC) in Bintulu, 
Sarawak delivered its 11,547th LNG cargo in 2020, a testament of PLC’s world-class performance and our 
focus on delivering operational excellence.
We also accomplished the following in 2020:
Sustained top quartile performance of our G&P and LNG assets demonstrating our strength in operational excellence and 
enabling us to extract more from less in difficult market conditions. This saw us turning in a world-class operational performance 
on the gas processing, gas transportation, regasification and utilities fronts: 
The gas processing business 
achieved an Operational 
Equipment Effectiveness or 
OEE rate of 99.4%, 99.6%, 
99.7% and 99.7% for sales gas, 
ethane, propane and butane 
respectively – above the targets 
set. The business also attained 
100% Product Delivery 
Reliability (PDR) for sales of 
gas, propane and butane.
Our gas transportation business and 
utilities plant for steam, electricity 
and industrial gases as well as LNG 
regasification terminals achieved 
100% reliability and PDR 
respectively.
Our onshore gas and offshore 
floating LNG plants in Malaysia 
achieved an overall OEE of 
96.8%.
Facilitated third-party shipper supply 
under the TPA for a 7 MMscfd capacity 
at the offshore LNG Regasification 
Terminal Sungai Udang (RGTSU) and 
the Peninsular Gas Utilisation (PGU) gas 
pipeline network.
Bolstered shareholders’ confidence via 
PGB’s total dividend payout of 127 
sen per share including special dividend 
of 55 sen per share, was achieved 
through the Group’s focus on safety, 
reliability and efficiency of operations, 
despite the global pandemic.
Strong commercial 
excellence enabled G+NE to 
respond well to fundamental 
and emergent shifts in the 
market while at the same time 
maximising value. In the LNG 
space for example, a significant 
shift in our mode of operations 
– from a produce-and-sell 
approach to demand-led planning – 
demonstrated our agility in responding 
to market shifts.

By tapping PETRONAS’ strength as an adaptive organisation, we endeavour to ensure long-term value creation and 
profitable growth for the Group and its partners by providing innovative, end-to-end customer-centric solutions that will 
help the Group secure new markets covering gas, renewable energy and hydrogen in the near future. The renewable energy 
developments that took place in the year under review were:
We introduced Yelo (a last 
mile logistic provider) in 
the B2B segment as a unique 
offering in the electric vehicle 
(EV) space in India. 
Amplus has also introduced innovative products that suit 
urban homeowners’ needs to render their terrace space 
useful rather than occupying it with low height solar 
structures. Under the HomeScape brand, Amplus offers 
real time and remote monitoring of solar generation 
and home energy consumption on a HomeScape app. 
Today, Amplus is offering 
risk-free solar solutions to its 
customers via a service model 
where Amplus invests its own 
capital to set up rooftop solar 
photovoltaic (PV) plants on 
customers’ premises. 
Digitalisation at G+NE
In 2020, G+NE went on to deliver the following achievements:
In 2020, several measures were taken to strengthen G+NE’s digital focus and transformation. These included the following:
Upgraded our signature 
Alpha LNG digital solution 
to enable demand-led 
production in order to 
improve the agility of our 
value chain amidst a volatile 
LNG market. To date, some 
USD42.4 million in value 
has been realised from 
data-driven planning and 
optimisation of scheduled 
deliveries. 
Implemented PGB’s 
Gas Processing Unit 
(GPU) Technical Centre 
(GTC), a centralised 
location empowered 
by digital that provides 
descriptive, predictive 
and prescriptive analyses 
to maximise plant 
reliability and prevent 
business interruptions. 
Embarked on the digital 
transformation for our RGTSU 
asset to build a new way 
of working through step-
changes in the terminal’s digital 
operations. This entailed a 
Unified Operation Centre, 
Virtual Asset Walkabout 
and JIT (Just in Time) Field 
Responder which all led to 
improved operational efficiency. 
Improved pipeline 
and Right-of-Way 
(ROW) encroachment 
monitoring through 
technological and digital 
means such as PiriGIS, 
Drone, CCTV and 
Parameter Intrusion 
Detection System 
(PIDS).
We support the PETRONAS Group in its efforts to expand its existing markets and capture new 
markets through innovative, end-to-end customer-centric solutions across the cleaner energy 
value chain.
PETRONAS Floating LNG SATU and DUA 
PETRONAS continues to harness its capabilities in floating LNG (FLNG) technologies to 
monetise stranded gas fields and further augment Malaysia’s resource investment potential. 
In 2020, PETRONAS became the first global energy company to own and operate two 
FLNG facilities, following the successful arrival of the PFLNG DUA at the Rotan gas field 
in Block H, offshore Sabah, where it has achieved its Ready for Start-Up (RFSU) milestone 
and progressing towards commercial operations. PETRONAS’ first FLNG, PFLNG SATU, 
has delivered 38 cargoes to date since start of production in 2017. These floating facilities 
provide an environmentally-friendly alternative to conventional onshore plants, which 
would otherwise require sizeable tracts of land to build and whose longevity depends on 
the supply of nearby gas reserves.
Virtual Pipeline System (VPS) 
This first-of-its-kind business solution for Peninsular Malaysia enables LNG to be supplied 
to small-scale customers and off-grid customers located away from the PGU gas pipeline 
network via trucks fitted with cryogenic tanks. In 2020, a total of 62 tanks of LNG were 
delivered via the VPS. 
LNG Bunkering service via an LNG Bunkering Vessel (LBV)
PETRONAS is one of the first service providers in Southeast Asia to launch the LBV service. 
The maiden delivery saw LNG from our modified Floating Storage Unit 1 at RGTSU being 
loaded onto the MV Avenir Advantage, PETRONAS’ first LNG bunkering vessel. The vessel 
then sailed for the ship-to-ship transfer to the SIEM Aristotle in the waters off Pasir Gudang in 
Johor. This solution underscores the Group’s efforts to drive greater use of LNG as a cleaner 
and economically competitive source of energy in the marine industry as well as support the 
concerted efforts under the IMO 2020 Regulations to limit sulphur content in marine fuels.
LNG export via ISO tank
This customer-centric and pragmatic solution supports and enables greater accessibility 
to cleaner energy, particularly for remote customers located away from physical LNG 
pipelines and customers with smaller parcel requirements. Furthermore, the delivery of 
LNG via ISO tanks can also act as an agile backup solution to address importing terminal 
restrictions for large vessel deliveries. In 2020, we signed a long-term deal with Tiger Clean 
Energy Limited (TCEL) for the supply of LNG to TCEL’s LNG ISO Tank filling facility at Bintulu 
for distribution to China.

We also encouraged PETRONAS’ employees to transition 
to solar energy to power their homes with competitive 
solar solutions offered through the employee-exclusive 
HomeScape by PETRONAS programme. This resulted 
in the registration of a total capacity of 3.2MW for 
installation at the employees’ homes in Peninsular Malaysia.
In Malaysia, PETRONAS is focusing on rooftop solar 
solutions for commercial and industrial customers via 
M+ by PETRONAS which has over 90 MW capacity under 
development. In 2020, a total of 13 out of 15 Lotuss 
stores (previously known as TESCO) across Malaysia were 
fitted with rooftop solar solutions. Upon completion, this 
initiative will help Lotuss reduce approximately 13,624 tCO2e.
We are also making good progress by way of cleaner energy 
generation in our own backyard. PETRONAS’ assets and 
facilities including our retail stations, operations sites, as well 
as the Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd 
and Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS sites, are all being fitted 
with rooftop solar solutions. A 49 MW rooftop and ground 
mounted solar panel installation is being planned for 
PETRONAS Refinery and Petrochemical Corporation (PRPC) 
and Projek Air Mentah RAPID (PAMER) as part of the PRPC Solar 
Master Plan located at Pengerang, Johor.
With close to 1GW of solar capacity projects under 
operation and development in India and Dubai, PETRONAS 
New Energy’s wholly-owned distributed energy company, 
Amplus, continues to reinforce its position as a key 
regional clean energy provider. Amplus is now capable of 
providing cleaner energy to India’s utility sector on top of 
its commercial, industrial and residential customers. It is 
also the first solar company in India to trade power online 
through the Green Term Ahead Market (GTAM) for 
electricity, a move that will spur participation in India’s 
renewable energy sector.
G+NE rolled out its Hydrogen business 
through the signing of an MoU 
with Sarawak Energy Berhad (SEB) 
in November 2020, to explore the 
development of competitive green 
hydrogen production and a value 
chain to serve emerging markets in 
Asia. These efforts will supplement the 
low-carbon hydrogen that PETRONAS 
is already producing as a co-product 
at its facilities. PETRONAS has to date 
been involved in producing grey and 
blue hydrogen; and will now work with 
stakeholders to explore the production 
of green hydrogen.
Hydrogen is a clean and a versatile source of energy that can be used as an energy carrier as fuel for mobility, power and 
heating, as well as feedstock for industry. Grey hydrogen is produced using fossil fuels like natural gas and coal, which emit 
CO2 into the air in the process. Blue Hydrogen is made in a similar manner using carbon capture technologies to prevent CO2 
from being released, enabling the captured carbon to be safely stored deep underground or utilised in industrial processes. 
Green hydrogen, the cleanest of these three varieties, produces zero carbon emissions. It is produced using electrolysis 
powered by renewable energy, like offshore wind, to produce a clean and sustainable fuel.

In our LNG business, as market leadership comes under pressure, we will be 
defending our core markets and getting expanding to new ones. To do so, our 
LNG marketing efforts and touch points with customers will be increased to truly 
provide innovative customer-centric solutions such as our VPS, LBVs and ISO tank 
solutions. This will enable us to capture opportunities in this period of low demand 
and amidst the global supply glut.
The Gas & Power (G&P) is also expected to continue facing a growingly 
competitive domestic market. While routes to increase sales are being explored 
including scaling up sales via VPS and LNG bunkering, we are also looking into 
more fundamental shifts for the G&P 
business to realise its growth plans. 
In Malaysia, PETRONAS remains 
committed to support the gas market 
liberalisation and is working closely 
with the government to shape the 
future of gas demand through energy 
policy developments such as the 
National Energy Policy and Natural Gas 
Roadmap.
New Energy and Hydrogen, will 
serve as the new growth engines 
for G+NE. New Energy continues 
to gain momentum in both the 
domestic and international markets 
and is currently on track with its 
growth trajectory that is set to hit 3 
gigawatts (GW) in 2024. This will be 
achieved through partnerships and 
acquisitions on top of building New 
Energy’s capacities organically. With 
the increased push towards a green 
and sustainable energy, growth in this 
sector is expected to be substantial 
although competition is expected to 
intensify. Our focus markets in India, 
Malaysia and Asia Pacific offer sizeable 
opportunities and we hope to capture 
significant capacity from these markets. 
New Energy is expected to grow 
considerably in our portfolio to capture 
new value pools as well as contribute 
to our reduced emissions target.
For the Hydrogen business, we continue 
to set in place the building blocks to 
drive the business with the immediate 
target of exporting hydrogen from our 
existing facilities. Through partnerships, 
we are also making our move to 
become a competitive green hydrogen 
producer. The MoU with SEB to explore 
the commercial production of green 
hydrogen bodes well in supplementing 
the ongoing low carbon hydrogen 
production efforts. Additionally, 
pursuing low carbon solutions through 
renewables and hydrogen, lend support 
to our Sustainability Agenda as well as 
contribute to PETRONAS’ NZCE 2050 
aspiration.
Moving into 2021, G+NE will execute PETRONAS’ Three-Pronged Growth Strategy to push our four businesses forward. In line 
with the Group’s Stepping-Out strategy and NZCE 2050 aspiration, G+NE continues to reinforce its position on the energy 
transition front by making strategic moves into new areas of opportunity in the cleaner energy space.
Having reviewed our business portfolio, G+NE as PETRONAS’ one-stop-centre for cleaner energy solutions, is determined 
that moving forward, it will anchor itself on this winning formula, namely Operational Excellence, Commercial Excellence and 
Customer-centricity and Sustainability.
G+NE’s focus on Operational Excellence will see us leveraging the years of experience we have accumulated, to enable us 
to ride out the current challenges brought on by the pandemic. Our current assets will continue to prioritise reliability and 
efficiency, while we will benchmark ourselves against industry leaders to match or surpass their performances. It is through 
these lenses that we will fulfil our role of maximising value through LNG and domestic gas sales. However, in our pursuit of 
operational excellence, there will be no compromise on safety, and it will continue to be one of our topmost priorities.
Commercial Excellence and Customer-centricity focuses G+NE’s efforts on value-centric opportunities. It covers our existing 
business segment as well as our new growth engines.

The year 2020 was like no other. As movement restrictions came into play, abruptly 
halting economic activities and altering lifestyles, demand for petroleum products 
eroded. Amidst this demand disruption, the Downstream business resiliently sustained 
its overall operational performance, preserving production volume and standards. 
The overall integrated value chain was well supported by reliable assets resulting in 
stable operations across the business. Throughout this period, Downstream remained 
focused and continued to operate at an optimum level. At the peak of the pandemic 
and the implementation of global lockdowns, we closely monitored our operational 
requirements and were prepared to continue operating, despite minimal manning.
In Malaysia, when the government imposed the Movement Control Order (MCO) in 
March 2020, petroleum products including gasoline and jet fuels registered a significant 
decline. PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad (PDB), took the hardest hit with its overall sales 
volume dipping by 23 per cent. Upon the easing of the MCO and restrictions being lifted, 
domestic activities slowly resumed and started to build up again in the second half of the 
year until the Conditional MCO was imposed again in the final quarter of 2020. 
At a global level, the slowdown in the economy and travel restrictions caused global 
oil demand to erode by 22 million bpd. Market recovery continues to be challenging 
and the overall outlook remains uncertain. The market will take time to fully bounce 
back depending on the effectiveness of vaccine deployment. Meanwhile, Downstream 
continues to strengthen its foundations and deliver excellence through ongoing efforts. 
This will allow us to capitalise on the situation once the market recovers.
In 2020, the Downstream business witnessed the 
creation of real value in a time of crisis. Despite 
margin erosions, the business sustained its 
operational performance for the financial year, 
supported by our integrated value chain and reliable 
assets. The year’s unprecedented events served 
as a catalyst, accelerating some of our strategic 
plans that had been embedded in our core business. 
By deploying innovative solutions, we overcame 
customers’ pain points and delivered seamless, 
frictionless customer experiences. 
Moving forward, we will work hard to ensure the 
sustainability of our Operational Excellence efforts. 
We are also gazing out into the customer needs 
horizon and identifying potential areas of high-
value growth. By shifting our business focus from an 
output-led to demand-led one, we aim to create an 
agile enterprise with innovation at scale. This will 
see us pushing boundaries and stimulating portfolio 
growth beyond traditional oil and gas into the 
broader energy solutions arena.

The COVID-19 pandemic 
has undoubtedly been a 
game-changer to those 
who have been swift to 
embrace and adapt to the 
disruption it has brought. 
Within PETRONAS, it has 
accelerated our strategic 
plans to secure new 
revenue streams and is 
positioning our businesses 
for their next chapter of 
growth. 
Focused On
Growth

We keep the sustainability of OE in check while enabling us to gaze out into the future 
horizon of customer needs and identify areas of potential high value growth. It is 
helping guide the shift of our focus and business from being output-led to becoming 
demand-led. At the same time, it is enabling us to prepare ourselves with the right 
talent, culture and tools to secure new opportunities and mitigate the challenges 
ahead. 
The intensive digitalisation efforts being undertaken within Downstream are enabling 
this shift. This, for instance, encompasses areas such as predictive analysis of output 
which anticipates customer needs even before they arise. Measures are underway to 
diversify the Downstream portfolio even further to create fresh solutions for customers 
which are not solely dependent on hydrocarbon resources. While we have made good 
progress to date, we need to amplify and scale with pace, so we can truly grow.
Our latest development, the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) in Johor, has 
been designed with a Growth Blueprint since its very beginning. It incorporates a 
detailed roadmap that outlines its three phases of growth over the next 10 years. The 
agile design of the facility enables the business to extract the highest value from its 
molecules for maximum value creation, with the ultimate aim of positioning PETRONAS 
as a specialty chemicals producer and PIC as the leading petrochemicals park in the 
region. Driven by sustainable development, PIC will strive to achieve net zero carbon 
emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050). PIC is expected to commence operations in the 
second half of 2021.
Going beyond fuel, PDB has 
reinvented its retail offerings 
by expanding its food and 
beverage (F&B) products through 
the Makan@Mesra initiative 
which addresses the increasing 
demand for fresh and well-
balanced premium food-to-go 
solutions at affordable prices. 
The new concept is part of PDB’s 
continuous efforts to grow its 
non-fuel business and elevate 
customers’ experience at its 
remodelled Kedai Mesra outlets. 
By the end of 2021, PDB will 
have expanded its F&B product 
line in over 200 stations from 22 
stations currently.
In Support of Entrepreneurs 
The Downstream business is the PETRONAS business that is closest to customers’ 
hearts, hence it focuses on creating a positive social impact and enriching communities, 
especially local entrepreneurs. In support of the Malaysian government’s “Beli Barangan 
Malaysia” campaign, PDB launched its “Love Local” campaign to intensify support for 
local entrepreneurs by allowing them to leverage PETRONAS’ network of stations to 
market their goods.
To date, more than 350 local vendors are supplying products to PDB’s Kedai Mesra 
network nationwide. 
The Downstream business, in collaboration with Tata Consultancy Services, also aims 
to shape a sustainable future for communities by leveraging on digitalisation and 
technology to address the issue of youth unemployment. Through the 12-month SEEd.
Lab. social enterprise programme, we aim to contribute towards the development of 
youth aspiring to be social entrepreneurs by helping them build their own sustainable 
businesses. This will not only help improve their well-being but will also create multiplier 
effects for the communities around them. Recently, SEEd.Lab successfully delivered its 
first cohort and will enter its second cohort this year.

ROVR
another Malaysian first, is a mobile refuelling station for both 
commercial and everyday drivers. It aims to ensure undisrupted 
fuel services to customers and has, to date, delivered over 10 
million litres of fuel. ROVR was mobilised during the Restricted 
MCO in Kedah and flash floods in Pahang, to fuel vehicles for 
rescue missions when there was no way to get to petrol stations.
Resolutely Reinforcing 
Our Reputation
The one thing that remained 
resolute amidst 2020’s volatility, 
was customer affinity towards 
the PETRONAS Brand. PDB was 
voted as Malaysian’s favourite 
automotive fuel and lubricants 
brand at the prestigious Putra

The Great Reset has resulted in a disruptive transition and 
Downstream needs to change fundamentally as a business 
so that we can move forward together with the rest of the 
Group as a more agile organisation in the market. As we 
venture forth, the Downstream business remains committed 
to enriching lives through innovative solutions. To maintain 
our competitive advantage, we will continue to leverage new 
tools, advanced infrastructure and high-value products, as well 
as robust strategies and business models to deliver sustainable 
and long-term value creation opportunities. In addition to that, 
we will also continue to leverage our integrated value chain

an agile enterprise with innovation at scale. In the long run, we 
want to push boundaries that have not been explored and will 
continue to inculcate an innovation culture. 
The market will continue to be challenging as the energy 
sector undergoes a historical transition in an unprecedented 
manner and scale. Demand for cleaner energy continues to 
grow and a new algorithm has been embedded within the 
market. The entire energy transition requires full collaboration 
and full buy-in from a broad cross section of industries. We are 
experiencing a revolution in the way energy is being produced 
and consumed on a global scale, from carbon intensive to 
low carbon sources. Eventually it will also impinge on scalable 
solutions for critical sectors such as the heavy trucking, iron 
and steel, cement, shipping, and aviation sectors, to name a 
few. All eventualities must be considered today if we are to 
protect our tomorrow. 
As we venture forth into the new year, we anticipate a gradual 
recovery for the domestic market. It may take a longer time 
before we see anything close to our previous numbers again. 
This will to a large extent depend on the trajectory of the 
overall crisis, the efficacy of the vaccines that are now being 
distributed across the world, as well as fluctuating product 
prices. 
Moving forward, we will continue to focus on delivering a 
seamless and frictionless experience to our customers in

The year’s twin shocks saw PD&T facing an uphill task as all areas of project 
delivery, technology and technical solutions were affected. This in turn 
hindered projects and prevented sanctioned targets from being met. The period 
March-October 2020 was the most harrowing, with some projects registering 
30 to 90 days of zero productivity. Moreover, there were supply chain 
interruptions for equipment and materials from pandemic-impacted nations; 
delays in procurement activities; restrictions in critical staff movements; and 
a lack of access to manufacturing facilities. These resulted in project cost 
overruns with contractors requiring Extensions of Time and activating the force 
majeure clauses in contracts. 
Amidst this backdrop, PD&T took extraordinary measures to contain project 
costs, safeguard investments and optimise emerging technologies to safeguard 
the value chain. To protect value, PD&T and the businesses took swift and 
decisive steps to rationalise capital expenditure (CAPEX) to free up cash flow. 
We also secured alternative supply sources from non-affected countries and 
Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), while technology was leveraged as 
a differentiator to ensure projects that are critical to PETRONAS’ future growth 
such as our Facilities of the Future (FOF) programme, our Remote Autonomous 
Operations (RAO), and the commercialisation of Hydrogen, maintained their 
momentum. 
We strengthened the resiliency of operations by tapping digital tools 
including predictive and prescriptive analytics as accelerators. This helped 
maximise operational uptime and cost compression across the Group’s 
operations. Utilising data as an asset, we leveraged tech-digital solutions to 
proactively monitor the well-being of our people across diverse locations and 
environments. PD&T’s efforts generated RM2.9 billion in cost savings across 
the PETRONAS Group. This included the on-track deployment of the Kasawari 
Integrated Offshore High Contaminant Project, which recorded 1 million safe 
man-hours on the back of stringent SOPs and zero COVID-19 cases. 
Serving as PETRONAS’ Centre of Excellence, Project 
Delivery and Technology (PD&T) is mandated with 
servicing, safeguarding and shaping PETRONAS’ business 
portfolio across the value chain with its distinctive 
research and technical expertise, innovative solutions, as 
well as robust systems and processes. 
Amidst 2020’s disruption that delayed projects 
and prevented targets from being met, PD&T took 
extraordinary measures to safeguard the PETRONAS value 
chain. From containing project costs and safeguarding 
investments, to optimising emerging technologies and 
tapping innovation to accelerate projects, we were able 
to successfully swing things around for the Group’s 
businesses. Moving forward, we will look to PD&T’s 
mantra of “Technology as a differentiator; Digital as an 
accelerator; and Data as an asset” to guide us in our efforts 
to bring a semblance of normality back to an otherwise 
highly disrupted playing field.

Today, PETRONAS’ Hydrogen business is accelerating 
forward in its efforts to achieve competitive costs in 
production. We have built our green hydrogen production 
testing facility, complete with an advanced electrolyser 
that we developed to enable efficient and cost-effective 
green hydrogen production. The system is designed to 
deliver about 50 kg of clean hydrogen per day. Combined 
with competitive clean electric, hydrogen will be the new 
source of fuel in the future.
By leveraging CO2 separation technology such as the 
one deployed at the Kasawari Integrated Offshore High 
Contaminant Project, we aim to convert CO2 into fuel for 
land transportation.
Our ultimate aim is to produce green hydrogen where we 
produce plant-based aviation fuel. In the process, water 
becomes energy and the energy consumed is also emitted 
as water vapour.
Bio-Agenda, a strong sense of appreciation for resources 
has led to projects on biomass to chemicals, bio-based 
specialty surfactants, and plant-based aviation fuel from 
crude algae oil. Efforts to enrich lives sustainably continue 
with fuels and lubricants research (novel additive for fuels, 
ionic liquid and graphene studied for future mobility), as well as 
thermal management fluids for energy storage, among others.
Advanced Connectivity
Advanced Materials
While remote operations will help reduce carbon emissions in our operations, we also see much potential in converting contaminants such 
as CO2 and biomass feedstock into high-value products. To date we are exploring the following initiatives:
Advanced Bio-Fuel and Hydrogen Production
Facilities of the Future (FOF) Programme
As part of our efforts to reduce our carbon footprint, increase safety on our offshore platforms and reduce operational expenditure 
(OPEX) by up to 50 per cent, we are leveraging the FOF programme. It is part of the paradigm shift that PETRONAS is aggressively 
pushing by making the most of Remote Autonomous Operation (RAO) technologies. Under the RAO approach, there will be zero 
exposure to any sort of hazardous risk and faster response time as there is no requirement to travel and be physically present at site.
As we move into the new norm, members under the purview of the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP) have 
embarked on a long-term sustainability effort of operating oil and gas facilities remotely. This is to standardise and ensure industrial 
acceptance of a safe and reliable remote operation of Normally Unattended Facilities (NUF). In addition, a remotely operated facility 
also reduces carbon emissions as there would be less need for marine vessels to mobilise crew visits. PETRONAS sees this as an 
important and critical milestone that is safer and more cost effective. As such, PETRONAS has positioned itself to play a critical role in 
supporting the NUF task force and the Joint Industrial Practices of IOGP.
The remote capability and autonomous operation functions augmented by technologies such as digital twins do not just accord us a 
safe working environment, they also help to improve the availability and predictability of our assets.
This will result in a more reliable, sustainable plant operations and a significant reduction in our operating costs. The groundwork 
needed to accomplish this includes enhancing the readiness of our infrastructure such as our information technology/operational 
technology (IT/OT) system; ensuring reliable and robust connectivity; implementing process automation, cloud-enabled solutions, 
remote assistance, robotics, software and applications; and more importantly, strengthening our safety shutdown philosophy and the 
overall functional safety system. 
Our pilot RAO project, the platform at the Resak field offshore Terengganu, is progressing well and has the potential to achieve a 
30 per cent reduction in OPEX.

PETRONAS Climate Change Position
As a conscientious player in the global energy sector, PETRONAS recognises its responsibility to balance out the threat of 
climate change with the mandate to produce affordable and reliable energy in a sustainable manner. As such, PETRONAS 
facilitates the management of climate change through various interventions, especially the reduction of GHG emissions 
across all sectors. Over the past few years, the PETRONAS Group has been steadfastly exploring and implementing the 
following climate change actions:
The target value to be generated from our NZCE 2050 efforts will be subjected to progressive changes in PETRONAS’ 
portfolio mix by way of scalable renewables and use of low carbon energy such as natural gas and hydrogen.
Addressing Climate Change
Over the years, the call for transformational climate actions has grown even more urgent and the pressure for the energy 
industry to respond accordingly has increased. In response to this, PETRONAS has committed to operating in a responsible 
manner that helps reduce the impact of climate change. We continue to make good progress by generating low-carbon 
solutions and renewable energy as means to reduce GHG emissions and to improve operational excellence. 
We also aim to ensure that all our efforts are reported in a clear and concise manner that is aligned with our commitment to 
our stakeholders. A summary of our initiatives to date is outlined below:

Responsible Reporting to 
Stakeholders
PETRONAS strives to collaboratively 
reduce environmental impact by 
transitioning to lower carbon energy 
solutions and deploying 
innovative operations and 
technologies.
We are committed to upholding PETRONAS’ 
Sustainability Agenda by balancing out our economic 
ambitions with social and environmental considerations. 
On the environmental front, we endeavour to safeguard 
the environment in a sustainable manner by being 
mindful of our actions and recognising the impact of 
our operations at every stage of the value creation cycle. 
Our focus is on mitigating the negative impact that our 
operations may have on society and the environment. 
At times, this may mean going beyond compliance with 
existing environmental legislation.
Our efforts include continuous emissions monitoring 
for selected equipment, spill prevention, greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions reduction, Best Practicable 
Environmental Option (BPEO) for decommissioning, and 
sustainable waste management. While these efforts are 
implemented in compliance with existing standards and 
regulations, the Group also undertakes self-regulation 
that goes beyond compliance with environmental laws. 
We achieve this by setting in place and adhering to 
internal standards, fortified by continuous assurance 
activities to manage our emissions, wastewater, 
hazardous waste and use of natural resources.
Apart from that, we also leverage advanced technology 
to harness precise data to continually improve 
operational efficiency. While we work to fortify our core 
operations in a responsible manner, we continue to 
explore opportunities in the renewable energy space 
and tap new technologies that will help us move closer 
towards a lower-carbon energy future. We have also 
announced our long-term aspiration of achieving net 
zero carbon emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050), which aims 
to accelerate our progress as we move towards a low 
carbon economy.

These actions meet the requirements of the PETRONAS Climate Change Framework and PETRONAS Carbon Commitments 
which were established to urgently address the need to stabilise GHG concentrations in the atmosphere as per the objectives 
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
The PETRONAS Climate Change Framework identifies the various aspects of the Group’s carbon footprint and 
outlines a mitigation and adaptation strategy that is enabled through the deployment of technological innovation, 
capability development and mindset change.
Mitigation
Proactively reduce GHG emissions within our 
operational boundaries and look for opportunities to 
offset emissions after sustainable reduction efforts. 
This is achieved by driving operational excellence, 
investing in clean and low carbon energy, and deploying 
technological innovation to drive economic, social and 
environmental benefits. On top of this, internal carbon 
pricing mechanisms are enabled to manage potential 
carbon liabilities.
The Climate Change Position Framework and PETRONAS Carbon Commitments support Malaysia's Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement by reducing GHG emissions and adapting to the physical impacts of climate 
change. Our global commitment also supports the respective NDCs of the countries where we operate.
All of these initiatives collectively support PETRONAS’ target to achieve its NZCE 2050 aspiration as well as the Group’s aim of 
creating new and inclusive opportunities that contribute towards equitable socio-economic development.
PETRONAS Carbon Commitments
The Group’s management of GHG emissions are guided by the PETRONAS Carbon Commitments (PCC). Developed in 2012, 
the PCC was first founded to drive the Group’s reduction of hydrocarbon flaring and venting as well as energy efficiency 
improvements. Since then, the PCC’s management scope has evolved to include CO2 gas fields management, carbon pricing, 
carbon offsets and renewable energy. The incorporation of PCC requirements in the Group’s systems and operations is 
overseen by our Group Health, Safety, Security and Environment (GHSSE) as well as the Upstream, Gas + New Energy (G+NE) 
and Downstream businesses together with Project Delivery and Technology (PD&T). In addition, the Petroleum Arrangement 
Contractors (PACs) are also guided by the PCC requirements in the effective implementation of the PCC.
The reduction of GHG emissions is not only essential for us to meet our environmental commitments, it is also an integral 
component of our value creation and business strengthening efforts. As such, we carefully assess all potential risks from 
carbon liability including emerging legislation related to climate change. This enables the Group to develop suitable 
technologies in a timely manner. Our identification and response activities are supervised by the PETRONAS Enterprise Risk 
Management profile that is employed groupwide and across our operations.
Climate Actions
PETRONAS’ commitment to delivering clean and low-carbon energy to our customers is reflected in the climate actions that 
the Group carries out. These initiatives help us to ensure that we mitigate the impact of our operations even as we seek to 
increase the value of our products.
Safeguard the Environment

We remain committed to minimising flaring in our projects through measures such as embedding zero-continuous flaring 
features within our project designs, and reducing flaring either by improving operational efficiencies or by finding innovative 
ways of monetising the hydrocarbon gas. We are also continuously making improvements to plant processes to reduce low-
pressure flare gas.
In 2020, our businesses achieved the following: 
PETRONAS continues to promote natural gas and LNG as a low carbon fuel by the effective management of methane 
emissions in the natural gas and LNG value chain. By managing hydrocarbon venting, we are able to reduce methane 
emissions. The year saw the following initiatives being brought into play:
In March 2020, PETRONAS officially became a Signatory Member of the 
Methane Guiding Principles (MGP) partnership, joining other industry and 
non-industry organisations in improving and accelerating the performance 
of methane emissions management throughout the gas value chain. As a 
partner, PETRONAS will have access to strategic collaborations, 
upskilling programmes, and access to technical studies as well as 
best practices.
Signatory Members in MGP are required to fulfil the five MGP principles 
that focus on priority areas for action along the natural gas supply chain, 
from production to the final consumer. To this end, PETRONAS will continue to 
achieve the following undertakings:
PETRONAS has initiated 
a methane emissions 
quantification baseline 
study in 2020 (for LNG and 
gas processing facilities) and will 
continue with Upstream facilities 
in 2021.
As the national oil company, 
PETRONAS continues to 
advocate methane emissions 
management among 
upstream companies 
operating in Malaysia through 
the establishment of a plan-of-
action for both MGP members and 
non-MGP members.
Methane emissions management 
has been incorporated as one of 
the key components to achieve 
NZCE 2050.

Upstream successfully reduced 340,000 tCO2e GHG emissions through a hydrocarbon venting reduction initiative. 
This reduction was realised through operational excellence where separator tuning and recommissioning of an additional 
pipeline for gas delivery was completed.
In Downstream, the Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) plant of PETRONAS Chemicals Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) 
Sdn Bhd collaborated with PETRONAS Gas Berhad’s (PGB) Utilities Gebeng (UG) plant in Kuantan, Pahang to reduce 
GHG emissions through the rejuvenation of a Hydrogen-Rich Gas (H2-RG), supply to UG. In turn, UG was 
able to reduce the cost of fuel used for steam generation by mixing fuel gas with H2-RG, which reduced GHG emissions 
by 46,000 tCO2e.
At Malaysian Refining Company Sdn Bhd (MRCSB), the installation of a flare recovery unit enabled flared gas to be 
recovered back into the fuel gas system as refinery fuel gas. The installation resulted in a decrease in natural gas 
consumption which led to reduced GHG emissions. MRCSB saw cost savings of RM14.9 million and a total annual 
reduction of 21,747 tCO2e. 
MRCSB also implemented another flaring reduction project where recovered excess hydrogen led to a decline in the emission 
of flaring and waste gasses. MRCSB garnered a total of RM2.2 million (2.987 tCO2e) in realised savings.
Minimising Flaring
In 2020, our Gas Processing Santong (GPS) facility implemented furnace efficiency improvement activities such as situational 
assessments and air to fuel ratio system improvements. Through these efforts, GPS was able to reduce 100 gigajoules (GJ) of 
energy consumed per day which amounted to a reduction of 2,004 tCO2e per year.
In October 2020, Institut Teknologi Petroleum PETRONAS (INSTEP) and TNB Energy Services Sdn Bhd (TNBES) concluded 
their collaborative effort on the Smart Energy Efficiency (SEE) project which supports the National Agenda’s overall emissions 
reduction target as well as PETRONAS’ Sustainability Agenda.
Following INSTEP’s Detailed Energy Efficiency Audit, the institute has incorporated TNBES’ solutions to increase energy 
efficiency through retrofitting light-emitting diode (LED) lighting and high mast lighting in non-process areas. The collaboration 
has enabled INSTEP to save approximately 407,880 kWh per year in energy consumption, thereby reducing carbon dioxide 
emissions by 283 tCO2e.

PV technology was installed at PETRONAS Research Bangi (625 kWp) and five retail stations (136 kWp). In 2020, the SINARAN 
journey continued with the installation of solar PV technology at an additional three locations (607 kWp). To date, we have installed 
1,368 kWp of solar PV systems at nine sites, bringing Project SINARAN’s Scope 2 GHG reductions in 2020 to 1,317 tCO2e. 
Renewable energy solutions reduce GHG emissions by displacing fossil fuel based grid emissions. There are two possible 
ways that renewable energy solutions can contribute to our NZCE 2050 aspiration: 
We are continually identifying more viable sites for grid connected solar PV systems to further reduce our Scope 2 emissions.

new-energy.
PETRONAS has been increasing its momentum in stepping out to renewable energy. PETRONAS installed a 10 MW large-scale 
solar power plant in Gebeng back in 2014. Following the acquisition of Amplus in 2019, PETRONAS’ installed renewable energy 
capacity grew to 645 MW by the end of 2020. In the same year, PETRONAS’ New Energy business generated a combined total 
of 708 GWh of power from three projects located locally and internationally, thus reducing 0.51 million tCO2e. Moving forward, 
PETRONAS has set a target of achieving an installed renewable energy capacity of 3,000 MW by 2024.
Investments in Renewable Energy
On top of this, PETRONAS produces renewable energy via four key solar photovoltaic (PV) initiatives which reduce Scope 2 
GHG emissions and contribute to our NZCE 2050 aspiration as follows:

PETRONAS Energy Canada Limited (PETRONAS Canada) has significantly reduced the carbon footprint at its well pads 
through utilising solar panels to offset its power needs. This achievement is significant as the use of solar panels previously 
had reportedly less efficiency in isolated and remote locations. 
Working with a Canadian technology company, PETRONAS Canada has installed and tested a 20 kWp power generation and 
air compression system at its remote well sites. The company has successfully reduced its emissions to short durations during 
winter when the generator is needed to supplement power at the site. 
With testing complete, PETRONAS Canada will be incorporating this new power system into all its new well pad designs. The use of 
this system is set to eliminate 1,600 tCO2e per pad per year from entering the atmosphere. That number is 99 per cent of all GHG 
emissions from the traditional well pad which is roughly equal to the emissions produced by 350 gasoline-powered cars. 
PETRONAS is intentional in sharing knowledge of its breakthroughs with other producers at forums such as the Natural Gas 
Innovation Fund.
In an innovative approach to 
reducing GHG emissions, the 
INSTEP team collaborated with 
Mentari Alam EKO (M) Sdn Bhd 
(MAEKO), our food waste specialist 
partner, to launch the first 
Composter House. Implementing 
food composting technology, 
the Composter House comprises 
a composter machine that has 
the capacity to convert 100 kg 
food waste into 20 kg bio 
compost within 24 hours. 
This compost can later be used for 
planting and greening the campus. 
This initiative also helps us to 
move towards our goal of zero 
food waste. 
INSTEP can compost around 36.5 
tonnes of food waste annually. 
This serves to eliminate 10,262 
kg of CO2 emissions which is 
equivalent to the amount that 466 
trees can absorb annually.

Innovation Actions
Delivering Fuel Efficiency in Our Products
We are committed to undertaking continuous improvement of our products in our endeavours to be more fuel efficient. In 
2020, we introduced the new PETRONAS Primax 97 fuel with Pro-Race. Formulated with the world’s first Advanced Dual Friction 
Modifier, the fuel boasts 25 per cent less friction than our previous offering, resulting in more responsiveness. The new formula also 
facilitates better fuel and oil interaction, thus increasing fuel efficiency in terms of mileage and lowering carbon emissions.
In support of the Malaysian government’s plan to increase the biodiesel blend rate from 10 per cent to 20 per cent, biodiesel B20 
was introduced and made available at PETRONAS petrol stations in Sarawak during the year under review. PETRONAS Dagangan 
Berhad (PDB) is working closely with the relevant agencies to expand B20 implementation across the country as well as potentially 
increase the biodiesel blend rate in the future. The adoption of biodiesel by PDB hauliers has cut down PDB’s Scope 1 emissions 
by up to 3,722 tCO2e since 2017. As a result of our collective efforts, this has helped reduce as much as 278,850 tCO2e from the 
transportation sector’s GHG emissions in 2020 (equivalent to approximately 52 million mangrove trees sequestered per year), 
thereby positively contributing to the Malaysian government’s commitment to the Paris Agreement.
PETRONAS has been working with the Malaysian government on forest carbon offsets as part of efforts to meet NZCE 2050. 
In 2020, PETRONAS conducted a study with the Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM) to investigate the baseline of carbon 
sinks within the country. The FRIM study, which was completed in 2020, has helped us develop a position on forest-based 
carbon offsets.
Effective monitoring of our GHG emissions helps us to uphold stakeholder confidence while providing us with essential 
information that is vital to our mandate of reducing our carbon footprint to 49.5 million tCO2e by 2024. To ensure the 
integrity of our GHG data, we continue to enhance our GHG monitoring, reporting and authentication processes via various 
verification procedures. 
Our GHG emissions data for each of the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 has been externally verified, to a limited level of 
assurance, by ERM CVS, an independent third-party assurance provider. The verification, carried out under ISO 14064-3, 
covered the Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from our Upstream, G+NE and Downstream operations in Malaysia which 
represent on average approximately 96 per cent of the PETRONAS Group’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions for these 
three reporting years.

Environmental Management
The incorporation of environmentally friendly and sustainable practices into the Group’s business is vital as this helps us 
uphold our commitment to safeguard the environment and respond to stakeholders’ expectations. Our efforts to reduce our 
environmental footprint are underscored by our environmental management initiatives. These initiatives address every aspect of 
our business, from the design of our facilities to the management of our operations and execution of internal processes.
In ensuring ethical practices are observed throughout the Group, we have established internal environmental standards and 
guidelines that PETRONAS’ entities under the operational control of the Group are expected to uphold. These requirements are 
benchmarked against global best practices such as the requirements found in the World Bank guidelines and the International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards on Environment and Social Sustainability. Vigorous capability development 
programmes are provided while environmental practitioners are also assessed against pre-determined structured environmental 
competency programmes.
Environmental and social performance data are highly 
important elements for analysis, reporting and disclosure 
in line with our Sustainability Agenda. To better manage 
groupwide Environment and Social Performance data, a 
solution called the Environment and Social Performance 
Integrated and Centralised System (or EPICS) 
 was 
established at Group level under myHSSE in 2020. The tool 
acts as a centralised system for data collection, verification, 
automated analysis and reporting for environmental 
and social performance. It simplifies the process of data 
gathering, analysis and reporting while reducing human 
error as we move towards digitalisation. The system has 
been progressively developed and encompasses built-in 
performance modules such as the Air Emissions module 
that includes GHG emissions; the Hazardous Waste and 
Freshwater module; as well as the Grievance Management 
module. All these are expected to elevate the effectiveness 
of our data management endeavours. 
In 2020, PETRONAS generated approximately 92,040 metric tonnes of hazardous waste, marking a reduction of 20,183 metric 
tonnes from 112,223 metric tonnes in 2019. The high amount of waste generated in 2019 was contributed by tank cleaning 
maintenance activities. The slowdown in operational activities at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to 
the lower numbers in 2020. The total amount of waste recycled or recovered during the year in review was 65,173 metric 
tonnes, which was equivalent to 71 per cent of the total waste generated by the Group.

PETRONAS Refinery and Petrochemical Corporation (PRPC) Utilities & Facilities (UF) started its operation in 2017. The GHG accounting system that has been established 
was internally verified in 2020 which amounted to 2.59 million tCO2e for the year 2020. The GHG emissions from PRPC UF will be included in subsequent disclosures.
PETRONAS has initiated efforts to improve the credibility 
and transparency of GHG emissions data by embarking 
on a digital transformation journey that aims to enhance 
productivity and analytics while reducing human error. 
We have been using our own software called iCON (that 
incorporates API formulas and ISO 14064 standards to 
digitise GHG information from metering), to generate 
online reports and analytics. A pilot project was successfully 
conducted within G+NE in 2020. This has created value 
by replacing the tedious GHG data roll-up and reporting 
process with online data gathering, calculations and 
reporting. The insights generated through analytics provides 
opportunities for further reductions in GHG emissions.

extent of any climate vulnerabilities in the areas where we operate.
Climate Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessments
GHG Emissions Performance
PETRONAS’ extensive management of our GHG emissions comprise a combination of benchmark best practices and 
innovation. We continue to explore new ways in which we can improve our management processes. Our management 
practices have resulted in a continued downtrend of our GHG emissions since 2013. In 2020, we recorded a reduction of 0.6 
million tCO2e. Combined with our records since 2013, PETRONAS has achieved a total reduction of 13.4 million tCO2e. This 
bodes well for us as we journey towards capping our overall emissions at 49.5 million tCO2e by 2024.

Delivering Water for Life to Iraq’s Communities
PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad (PDB) first initiated the 
Water for Life programme in Malaysia in 2013 as part of its 
efforts to ensure that communities, especially those living 
in the interior areas, could receive a consistent supply of 
clean water. In 2015, the Water for Life programme was 
expanded to Iraq. Today, PETRONAS subsidiary, PETRONAS 
Carigali Iraq Holding B.V. (PCIHBV), is collaborating with 
the Host Authority Thi Qar Oil Company (TOC) and partner, 
JAPEX, to roll out the programme to tens of thousands 
of inhabitants within the Garraf Contract Area (GCA). The 
following initiatives have been implemented to date:
• 
Built Reverse Osmosis (RO) water stations facilities
• 
Provided toilets and water tanks to schools
• 
Installed water filters in schools
• 
Undertook clean water distribution
• 
Undertook planning for upcoming projects for RO water 
stations
As an International Oil Company (IOC) operating in Iraq, 
there are expectations for PCIHBV as a conscientious 
corporate citizen to undertake sustainable development 
for the nation in a meaningful manner. Even as the Water 
for Life programme successfully met the basic needs 
of people, provided equal access to all, and helped to 
improve the quality of life for communities in the GCA, 
PCIHBV was able to fulfil its obligations to the people of 
Iraq as well as strengthen its reputation. The success of 
the programme has strengthened PCIHBV’s reputation as 
a trustworthy entity to communities which is essential for 
the sustainability of this IOC’s operations in Iraq. 
This initiative, which has garnered accolades and the full 
support of the Iraqi government and local communities, 
bears testament to PETRONAS’ Statement of Purpose as 
a progressive energy and solutions partner enriching lives 
for a sustainable future.
Water at PETRONAS is primarily used for cooling and steam generation within our operations. To ensure the smooth and 
continuous flow of operations, we have developed robust internal standards and policies, as well as initiatives, to optimise our 
freshwater consumption.
Continuing our water balance development and verification work from 2019, we established best-achieved freshwater 
use intensity for the top 13 freshwater users in 2020. Doing so ensures continuous monitoring and optimisation of 
freshwater use.
With respect to our Downstream and G+NE businesses, we have identified four domestic and two international locations 
of focus with full consideration to future water stress. Our research and decision-making process were guided by the 
World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas.
We conducted a thorough water management assessment in 2020 for our Engen Refinery in Durban, South Africa. The 
assessment resulted in the development of a strategic water reduction roadmap to optimise freshwater use and to explore 
options to reduce dependency. Moving forward, we aim to continue the work for other locations identified as 
future water stress areas.
Providing Precious Water for Life in Republic of South Sudan
Water is a scarce resource in the landlocked Republic of 
South Sudan, the worlds’ youngest country. With limited 
income to spare for water purchases and the nearest river 
far from homes, many citizens rely heavily on hand-dug 
wells or surface water for their daily supply. Water sourced 
this way is easily contaminated and unsafe.
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the need for safe water 
became even more vital than ever. Responding to this, 
PETRONAS South Sudan completed Phase 4 of its Water 
for Life initiatives at Nyakuron West, Juba on World Water 
Day on 23 March 2021. This phase, which involved the 
completion of two water wells located at a community 
centre and at homes near the community, is today 
benefitting up to 12,000 people in the community.
PETRONAS South Sudan in collaboration with Republic 
of South Sudan’s Ministry of Petroleum and Nile Hope, a 
local NGO, have built a total of 15 water wells in various 
locations in Juba since 2018. All 15 water wells are 
constructed with solar-powered submersible pumps 
that can produce 405,000 litres of quality and safe water 
per day. This system requires minimal maintenance and 
capitalises on renewable energy which makes it a highly 
sustainable system, especially for rural areas.
As a result of PETRONAS’ Water for Life programme in 
Juba, over 87,000 South Sudanese today have access to 
clean water. Now members of the community, mainly 
women, girls and children, no longer need to walk up 
to 3 km to fetch water for their daily consumption. They 
can now easily fetch up to 600 litres of clean water a day 
nearer to their homes, thus saving time and effort. School 
children also no longer have to walk for miles to fetch 
water for preparing school meals. PETRONAS’ Water for 
Life programme has not only improved health, sanitation 
and hygiene, it has kept South Sudanese women and 
children safe as well as elevated the quality of life for 
Republic of South Sudan’s communities.

Air emissions from our facilities are actively monitored and all risks are evaluated and addressed accordingly as part of our 
integrated air emissions management approach. In enhancing data visibility, we developed an online monitoring platform that 
allows us to accelerate our response rate.
In 2020, the Group's sulphur oxides emissions stood at 84,225 metric tonnes compared with 110,214 metric tonnes in 2019. The 
decrease in emissions value was attributable to the usage of cleaner fuel (low-sulphur compliant fuel) in our fleets and lower 
operational activities.
Total nitrogen oxides emissions for 2020 decreased to 116,427 metric tonnes from 148,446 metric tonnes in 2019, mainly due to 
operational improvements and a reduction in operational activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
For more details of PETRONAS’ Raw Material Management practices, go to the Product Stewardship section on page 176.
PETRONAS ensures that all wastewater from our onshore and offshore operations are treated prior to being released into 
the environment. In 2020, the oil in water content decreased to 532 metric tonnes from 648 metric tonnes in 2019 due to 
reduced operational activities.
The term “produced water” describes water that is produced as a by-product during the extraction of any hydrocarbons. 
PETRONAS was part of the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP) task force that developed the Risk Based 
Assessment of Offshore Produced Water Discharges guidance document. In this regard, within Malaysia, we continued the 
produced water risk-based assessments for PETRONAS Carigali Sdn Bhd's onshore terminals and two offshore platforms. 
Supplier environmental assessments were initiated in order to enhance the level of disclosure of the identity of oilfield 
chemicals and their respective environmental performance. This initiative is part of the Raw Material Information Request 
(RAWMIR) process, which intends to improve prioritisation of production chemicals based on their impact on the marine 
environment and to ultimately refine produced water ecological risk-based assessments.
Wastewater Discharge
Recognising that sustainability goes hand in hand with healthy communities, PETRONAS has embarked on a voluntary evidence-
based management of environmental health which stretches beyond regulatory compliance, focusing on chemical exposures in 
air emissions and groundwater.
Protecting Community Health through Risk-based Assessments
PETRONAS successfully completed and handed over the National Oiled Wildlife Response Plan (NORWP) to the Department of 
Environment (DOE) in November 2020. The NOWRP is a supplementary document to the Malaysian National Oil Spill Contingency 
Plan (NOSCP). 
According to the Global Oiled Wildlife Response System, the NOWRP is the first oiled wildlife response plan in Southeast Asia. Through 
this initiative, we aim to create awareness on Oiled Wildlife Response preparedness across the industry and government agencies.
The NORWP was first utilised during a major oil spill incident in Tanjung Tuan, Port Dickson in Negeri Sembilan where PETRONAS 
assisted the DOE and Marine Department during the clean-up. The extensive beach clean-up saw PETRONAS providing technical 
advice and the Shoreline Clean-up and Assessment Technique to 16 supporting government agencies, including the Malaysian Armed 
Forces and Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA). During the year in review, we accomplished the following:
Enhanced our Global Oil Spill Response (OSR) preparedness via various capability development sessions including 
upskilling webinars and a certified Masterclass programme.
Successfully trained 75 personnel via the Masterclass sessions to become OSR Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) across 
our local and international operations.
Over 900 participants attended the webinar sessions.
We continue to work towards safeguarding our facilities against spills via our preventive maintenance and 
routine monitoring measures. In 2020, five hydrocarbon spills were recorded with a total estimated volume of 16.0 
cubic metres (2019: 24.9 cubic metres). 
Since 2018, we have been conducting baseline Human Health Risk Assessments (HHRA) at selected domestic 
operations to evaluate community exposure to ambient air chemicals.
In 2020, the effort was extended to include assessments in domestic and international operations.
In 2020, we developed a strategic environmental health roadmap which is guided by a priority plan for HHRA 
execution for the next five years.
PETRONAS Energy Canada Limited (PETRONAS Canada) 
has undertaken an initiative to reduce dependency on 
freshwater for oil and gas activities in both the North 
Montney Joint Venture (NMJV) and PETRONAS-Sasol 
Montney Partnership (PSMP) ventures through collaboration 
with peer producers on produced water sharing. During 
the hydraulic fracturing process, the water that we inject 
into the well flows back to the surface with the natural 
gas. In the first quarter of 2020, PETRONAS Canada shared 
produced water with Tourmaline Oil Corp. out of the PSMP. 
Similarly, PETRONAS Canada received produced water from 
Saguaro Resources Corp. in the Beg East area, supporting 
PETRONAS Canada Produced Water Initiative
the Bubbles b-24-B well pad completion and allowing this 
pad to be completed with 100 per cent produced water. 
(Well completion is the process of making a drilled well 
ready for production).
In 2020, PETRONAS Canada recycled 82.3 per cent of 
all water used for completion activities. We have made 
it a priority to reuse produced water from one hydraulic 
fracturing operation to the next and only draw on freshwater 
sources if there is a shortfall in available produced water. 
The reduced dependency on freshwater ultimately frees up 
the precious resource for use by the ecosystem.

Freshwater Withdrawal
In 2020, our total freshwater withdrawal was 60.0 million cubic metres as compared to 60.3 million cubic metres recorded in 
2019. The figures represent the total freshwater withdrawn by both our local and international operations.

Biodiversity is defined as the variability among living organisms from all sources including terrestrial, marine and other aquatic 
ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part. This includes diversity within species, between species and of 
ecosystems (Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) 1992). Ecosystems services are the essential services that support human 
needs such as food, water, shelter, clothing, medicines and fuel (International Finance Corporation (IFC) 2012).
There is now a greater demand for the business community to play a bigger role in Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services 
(BES) management and conservation. Within the oil and gas industry, this has been translated into a more transparent impact 
assessment and reporting of the industry’s contribution to biodiversity and ecosystems conservation based on standards set by 
bodies such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and World Economic Forum (WEF).
PETRONAS is committed to ensuring that the abandonment and/or disposal of all our Petroleum Facilities places a firm emphasis 
on the safety and protection of people, environment, assets and reputation in the course of Petroleum Operations. In performing 
these functions, we utilise PETRONAS’ established processes and guidelines as per the structured Decommissioning Option 
Assessments (DOA) to determine the best decommissioning and abandonment approach. In enabling decommissioning and 
abandonment activities to be carried out transparently, we leverage processes and guidelines that are on par with international and 
industry best practices and standards. 
In safely executing a sustainable decommissioning and abandonment agenda with minimal impact on the environment, we 
continuously build excellent synergies with relevant stakeholders and industries to explore sound solutions. The year in review 
saw PETRONAS continuing to work closely with the Department of Fisheries (DOF) Malaysia to evaluate the feasibility of 
converting retired oil and gas structures into artificial reefs so as to maximise the value of these decommissioned structures. In 
tandem with this, we also actively pursued collaboration with research and academic institutions in the form of joint studies, 
community practices, and sharing sessions, with the aim of refining and enhancing the techno-commercial viability of reefing in 
Malaysia. Some examples of focused research included undertaking offshore site-specific evaluations, reefing engineering, socio-
economic impact analysis and post-decommissioning monitoring. To date, our Rigs-to-Reefs initiative has demonstrated proven 
improvements to the marine ecology and fish aggregation, while offering protection from illegal trawling activities. 
Safeguard the Environment
Safeguard the Environment
PETRONAS completed five decommissioning projects, including 15 wells being plugged and abandoned (consisting of 
both ‘dry trees’ and ‘subsea wells’).
PETRONAS successfully secured a preliminary agreement for a 10-year Sarawak Master Reefing Plan with 
the DOF, Sarawak.
PETRONAS organised a series of monthly engagements in bridging academia with industry players through the “Industry 
Meets Academia” programme. The engagements sought to enhance collaboration in addressing decommissioning pain 
points through the pursuit of innovative decommissioning solutions and technologies.
PETRONAS successfully conducted 13 Lessons Learnt workshops with decommissioning service providers 
and Production Arrangement Contractors (PACs). From these workshops, 116 recommendations were captured to 
further improve the future execution of decommissioning projects.
PETRONAS continued to be active in the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP) 
Decommissioning Committee and was heavily involved in finalising two briefs, namely “Offshore Oil and Gas Pipeline 
Decommissioning” and “Ecology of Steel Piled Jackets and Subsea Infrastructure”.
In 2020, PETRONAS achieved the following on the decommissioning front:
In response to this, PETRONAS has subscribed to the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT), a one-stop global 
repository providing datasets on biodiversity. Towards this end, we are protecting the biodiversity and ecosystems surrounding 
our projects and operations by identifying BES risks using tools such as Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and BES risk 
assessment (BESRA). PETRONAS completed BES Risk Profiling for all our onshore and offshore facilities in Malaysia in 2020. A 
total of 28 onshore and 74 offshore facilities were assessed using the IBAT and categorised according to their risk level. The risks 
identified were then managed by applying a mitigation hierarchy and minimising risk impact by putting physical, operational or 
abatement controls in place. Restoration and rehabilitation activities were also implemented, with offset being the last option to 
manage residual impact.
PETRONAS will also continue to conduct programmes for biodiversity protection and conservation to maintain ecosystems 
essential for present and future generations. In stepping up our efforts, we collaborated with other industries in Malaysia through 
the Interim Working Group (IWG) for the establishment of the Malaysian Platform for Business and Biodiversity (MPBB). These 
collaborations saw PETRONAS sharing knowledge on BES management at a forum and hosting the inaugural IWG meeting at 
the PETRONAS Twin Towers on 19 February 2020. The IWG will also provide PETRONAS with an opportunity to engage with 
the Ministry of Water, Land and Natural Resources for the purpose of collaborating on BES management in Malaysia. In addition 
to that, PETRONAS will continue to engage with the various stakeholders in the government, non-government as well as 
communities to collaborate on halting biodiversity loss.
Our Efforts to Protect and Preserve Mexico’s 
Endangered Turtles
PETRONAS’ international subsidiary, PC 
Carigali Mexico Operations (PCCMO), 
is pioneering the Group’s turtle 
conservation efforts in Mexico. Aligned 
with Yayasan PETRONAS’ focus areas 
and guiding principles, this initiative 
underscores PCCMO’s support for 
efforts to conserve Mexico’s wildlife, 
especially in the areas where it operates. 
This initiative is also aligned with the 
Federal Attorney for Environmental 
Protection’s (PROFEPA) strategy to 
protect sea turtles.
The Hawksbill Sea Turtle Conservation 
Project at the Punta Xen Centre in 
Champoton, Campeche is important 
for Mexico as sea turtles are considered 
keystone species – meaning they are an 
important part of the environment and 
influence other species around them. 
Furthermore, Mexico is home to six of 
the seven endangered sea turtle species. 
PCCMO’s efforts comprise mainly 
of their funding of Grupo Ecologista 
Quelonios (GEQ), a non-profit 
organisation dedicated to the protection 
and preservation of endangered 
Hawksbill sea turtles. In 2020, PCCMO 
upgraded the centre’s facilities in time 
for the turtles’ arrival. The improvement 
of facilities allowed the staff to be 
more efficient in their work, which was 
reflected in the increase of the turtle 
population. As of September 2020, a 
total of 167,288 turtle hatchlings had 
been released – a 16 per cent increase 
over 2019’s numbers. Additionally, 
the rehabilitated centre is now a 
more visitor-friendly environment for 
researchers, students and tourists. The 
larger turtle population is set to benefit 
the entire ecosystem within the area. 
This effort has also positively impacted 
the community of Campeche with more 
employment opportunities being made 
available.
PCCMO intends to contribute towards 
helping the centre to become self-
sustainable, thus ensuring that the 
Hawksbill sea turtles are looked after 
for the long term. In the second 
phase of the project, PCCMO plans to 
collaborate with a local university to 
undertake a scientific study of the local 
ecosystem development and to track 
the positive impacts on both the sea 
turtle community and the environment. 
Through its efforts, PCCMO aims to set 
a precedent for other turtle conservation 
centres as well as PETRONAS’ 
international and local CSR activities.

Shaping a Generative HSSE Culture
The concept of caring for the safety and well-being of people is deeply rooted within PETRONAS’ HSSE strategy and 
management activities and is underscored by the Group’s Generative HSSE Culture which aims to reproduce transparency 
and mindfulness. This Generative HSSE Culture sees us prioritising and implementing very high safety standards, as well 
as making an effort to exceed them by going beyond compliance. In setting the bar high by way of process safety for our 
organisation and people, we are rallying our people to embrace HSSE as individuals as much as it is a collective responsibility. 
By ensuring our workforce and Management are as informed and transparent as possible, everyone knows what is really going 
on and this prepares us for the unexpected in our business. In the event something does go amiss despite all the precautions 
undertaken, we use this occurrence as a lesson to improve and prevent it from recurring in the future. Every ‘error’ is used as 
a key learning and issues are addressed in a manner in which we cultivate an ecosystem that promotes sustainable progress.
While our leaders are to serve as role 
models, everyone at PETRONAS is to 
take ownership of HSSE matters to 
create true value for the Group.
All of us are to be mindful about 
what we do and how our actions can 
impact others.
We are all to look out for one another 
and keep potential risks and errors at 
the top of our minds.
We are all to create a 
safe space to intervene 
when any of us sees 
unsafe conditions or 
behaviours.
In inculcating PETRONAS’ Generative 
HSSE Culture, these behaviours have 
become the mantra for all within the 
PETRONAS Group:
To enrich lives for a sustainable future, PETRONAS 
is endeavouring to build enduring and positive 
relationships with our employees, partners and the 
communities in which we operate by keeping each and 
everyone safe and adding value to their well-being 
through a variety of effective, tangible measures.
Ensuring an Effective and Sustainable HSSE 
Framework
In line with our efforts to effectively steward People, 
Planet and Profits, one of our topmost priorities is to 
take responsibility for the well-being of the employees 
and contractors under our care. To ensure our people 
are at their best level of health and are working under the 
safest possible conditions, we uncompromisingly enforce 
stringent Health, Safety, Security and Environmental 
(HSSE) policies across our highly complex business.
The PETRONAS’ Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) 
Policy is testament of our Management’s commitment to 
strengthen PETRONAS’ position as a reliable, responsible 
and caring employer. As we endeavour to build safe 
working environments and quality work processes, 
we also expect all employees and representatives 
of PETRONAS to conduct themselves in a safe and 
responsible manner in accordance with our HSE Policy. 
In tandem with this, a HSE Management System is in 
place to govern all HSE aspects of our business. The HSE 
Management System in turn has been established within 
the context of the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) continual 
improvement loop and aligned to the International 
Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) 14001:2015/
ISO 45001:2018 criteria. All these measures align with 
PETRONAS’ commitment to upholding seven of the 17 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) 
and the four Sustainability Lenses.

Digital HSSE at PETRONAS
Leading the Way to Shape the Generative HSSE Culture
Our leaders have immense potential to accelerate the formation of the desired Generative HSSE culture across PETRONAS’ 
businesses and operations. To support our leaders’ readiness to drive a prevailing HSSE culture, we have brought the HSSE 
Leadership Programme into play. Our aim is to enrol a total of 2,431 leaders covering HSSE practitioners, middle managers and 
top leaders into the programme by 2024. In 2020, we made good strides forward with some 55 per cent of PETRONAS’ leaders 
enrolled and upskilled. With more than half of our leaders equipped and immersed in the programme, we are on track to have the 
desired HSSE ecosystem prevail throughout our operations by the target date.
Reporting Unsafe Acts for Greater Mindfulness
Trust is a crucial element for us if we are to effectively shape the Generative HSSE Culture at PETRONAS. We inculcate trust among 
team members by asserting the fact that bringing up concerns and issues regarding unsafe acts and conditions is a form of care 
towards one another. Everyone is to look after each another to ensure everyone is safe. The Unsafe Act and Unsafe Condition 
(UAUC) initiative is one of our key safety behaviour programmes whereby employees are encouraged to proactively identify safety 
risks and hazards, then report these so that intervention can be carried out. Unsafe conditions are rectified immediately to ensure a 
safe work environment is maintained. The UAUC reports made are seen as an opportunity for learning and are valued by everyone. 
Due recognition by leaders affirms this positive behaviour. 
The digitalisation of UAUC reports since 2018 has made it convenient for employees across PETRONAS to submit their reports 
through web-based and mobile applications. This led to a 77 per cent increase in the quality of UAUC reported in 2020 in 
comparison to just 8 per cent reported in 2019. Real-time data analytics is also contributing towards the development of various 
forms of predictive analysis models to prevent potential incidents, potential Zero Tolerance (ZeTo) Rules violations and near repeats 
in the future.
For the year in review, amidst the restricted movement challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, we remained agile 
and adapted to the new norm by migrating our Generative HSSE Culture Leadership Programmes from conventional face-to-face 
training platforms to Virtual Instructor-Led Training (VILT). 
Moving forward, we will continue to shape a Generative HSSE Culture and develop our leaders at all levels so that they deliver 
the desired experiences and ensure forward accountability across our organisation. We will also continue to accelerate this by 
leveraging on digital applications such as myHSSE.

One of the signature programmes within the fold of PETRONAS’ Generative HSSE Culture is the “Jom Patuh dan 
Tegur” or “Let’s Comply and Intervene” initiative. It centres on creating a safe space for one’s peers to intervene 
whenever they identify an unsafe act or behaviour. Here at PETRONAS, we endeavour to live a culture of care not only 
for ourselves but for everyone around us. This culture sees colleagues reminding one another to be safe at all times and 
constantly being on the lookout for one another’s well-being simply because we value lives.
Our people operate in a high-risk environment and are 
constantly exposed to potential occupational hazards. 
As such, we are extra vigilant while on duty particularly 
at high-risk areas. Nevertheless, mishaps do happen at 
times and this is indeed something very difficult for all of 
us to accept. Despite our best efforts, news of casualties is 
something we can never truly prepare for. 
In the event of a fatality, we hold the Safety Stand Down. 
This is a sombre time set aside for all of us in diverse 
locations across PETRONAS to come together to show our 
grief, pay our last respects and honour those who have lost 
their lives in the line of duty. We also dedicate this time to 
reflect on the incident and the root causes from a shared 
space of concern and regret, as well as pledge to do better 
to ensure such an event does not recur.
We Stand Down in Solidarity Because
On 31 August 2020, one life was lost while another person 
was injured at the PETRONAS LNG Complex in Sarawak. 
Upon the incident occurring at the Acid Gas Removal Unit 
drain containment which was then under maintenance, both 
contractors were immediately sent to the hospital. However, 
sadly one of them succumbed to his injury. We are also 
deeply saddened to report another two fatalities that took 
place on 27 October 2020 in an incident involving a vessel, 
MV Dayang Topaz, which made contact with the platform 
structures at the Baram field, 14 nautical miles off Miri. There 
were 187 personnel on board at the time of the incident. 
The impact caused 125 personnel to jump overboard. 
The affected personnel were eventually rescued by the 
emergency responders and evacuated to Miri. However, 
two fatalities were reported. Sadly, MISC Berhad too 
recorded a fatal accident on 2 November 2020 as a result of 
an unfortunate mooring accident.
Safety Stand Downs are also held for our joint venture 
entities. On 15 March 2020, there was an explosion at the 
Diesel Hydro Treater Unit at the Pengerang Refinery and 
Petrochemicals Complex which resulted in six fatalities. 
The refinery complex is operated by Pengerang Refining 
Company Sdn Bhd, which is a joint venture entity with 
50 per cent effective share of PETRONAS Holding Company. 
As a PETRONAS associated company, the lessons learned 
were also shared amongst other PETRONAS operations.
The entire PETRONAS family is deeply saddened by these 
incidents. We have extended our heartfelt condolences 
and the necessary support to the bereaved families to 
help them cope with their great loss. In all these incidents, 
thorough investigations to identify the root causes were 
carried out with the relevant authorities and reported to the 
management. All recommendations made have since been 
instituted to ensure such incidents will not be repeated. 
One life lost is one too many and we will continue to work 
hard in upholding the safety and well-being of our people.
We Value Lives
One of the ways for us 
to learn our lesson from 
any major incident is by 
having a safety stand 
down. This is a moment 
for all components 
of the Group to come 
together to reflect 
on the incident and 
take responsibility for 
preventing any future 
recurrence.

COVID-19 Health and Safety Measures
Pandemic Preparedness Across PETRONAS
When the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing movement restrictions hit us in early 2020, PETRONAS responded swiftly by making 
the health and safety of our people our topmost priority. The PETRONAS Pandemic Preparedness and Response Team (PPRT) was set 
up with its roots going deep into our daily operations around the world. Working across the Group, they coordinated activities as well 
as rolled out and ensured adherence to stringent SOPs. The timely and proactive measures that the PPRT implemented to manage 
and curb the transmission of the virus across all our operations, went a long way in keeping our people safe and operations running.
The PETRONAS PPRT is tasked with managing and curbing transmission of the 
virus across all of the Group’s operations. The following were some of their key 
achievements in 2020. Other practices are ongoing.

The PPRT also supported the Group’s operational and business continuity efforts via technical advice to the Corporate Command 
Centre (C3). Established in March 2020, the C3 provides unified commands and generates strategic and tactical decisions across the 
businesses within the Group.
We also went on to set up cross-functional COVID-19 response teams that dealt with and tracked cases across the entire Group and 
attended to them immediately. We reviewed our global operations and mobilised our staff and families back to home countries when 
that was the better option. 
The Group also deployed digital tools to monitor our essential services and operations requirements, imposed minimal manning 
on site, and moved towards working from home. Despite the limitations, we were able to maintain our operational efficiency. As 
traditional ways of doing business were disrupted, we adapted quickly to the new norm via virtual meetings with key customers, 
stakeholders and government officials.

Ensuring Optimal Health and Well-Being
Given that employee well-being is one of PETRONAS’ key priorities, we have adopted a holistic approach to occupational 
health that encompasses everything from inculcating healthy lifestyle programmes to upholding stringent regulatory health 
requirements inclusive of effective health management and emergency response plans.
To ensure our employees lead heathy lifestyles, we brought the groupwide 
MESTIfit4health programme into play. Targeting five focus areas, the programme 
encourages employees to achieve optimum health by adopting healthy habits.
Upholding Effective Occupational 
Health Practices
Among the key SOPs that the Upstream business fully implemented domestically was an occupancy limit at any one 
time at our offices, plants and offshore facilities; while the other part of the workforce worked from home to 
ensure business continuity.
Some Upstream operation crews (specifically offshore personnel and those at selected terminals) had to undergo 
stringent COVID-19 testing as well as adhere to a minimum of seven to 10-day quarantine until their test results 
were released. 
As a precautionary measure to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of our employees, PETRONAS safely brought 
home employees and their family members from our operations abroad. The respective PETRONAS’ operations 
continued, while implementing the appropriate working arrangements and optimum manning levels, including working 
from home to ensure the continuation of operations while minimising close contact among employees.
COVID-19 infections at a few of our offshore locations required us to change the teams at our rigs as part of the 
efforts in managing and containing the spread of the virus.
Some crew members were quarantined for 14 days, remained offshore for 28 days and had another 14 
days of quarantine again upon returning. In total, some spent a total of 60 days away from their families. Many 
of them also went out of their way to ensure that the needs and welfare of others were taken care of before their own. 
Although the lockdown produced isolation which could lead to potential mental health issues, our people went above 
and beyond the call of duty by playing their parts.
We introduced relief, rental waivers and deferments for our retail operations so that Small and Medium 
Enterprises (SMEs) were able to remain in business. By looking out for our partners across the value chain, this went a 
long way in helping to keep them afloat. It also ensured PETRONAS was in a strong position to move forward quickly

The walk4trees challenge
– A Good Reason to Keep on Walking
The walk4trees challenge is a collaboration between 
PETRONAS Group Health, Safety, Security and Environment 
(GHSSE); Yayasan PETRONAS; Global Environment Centre 
(GEC) and BookDoc that aims to promote healthy lifestyles 
among PETRONAS staff, while they in turn pledge to do 
their bit to care for the environment. The programme entails 
planting one tree sapling for every 1 million steps that 
participants achieve. The initial challenge was to collectively 
record 20 billion steps by June 2021 and plant 20,000 
tree saplings to match this achievement. Some 20,000 
PETRONAS employees registered to take part upon the 
programme’s launch in early 2020 and the target seemed 
achievable – until the pandemic hit. Due to the lockdowns

and Movement Control Order (MCO), the average number of 
daily steps by the 20,000 participants quickly dwindled and 
only 11 billion steps or 55 per cent of the target was logged 
in as of December 2020. To supplement the number of 
steps, the challenge has been opened to the public through 
the walk4trees virtual run and the virtual Orchid Run under 
the patronage of PETRONITA, the Association of Wives of 
PETRONAS’ Employees and Women Employees.
In support of the programme, GEC will train selected local 
communities and accord them the opportunity, education 
and support to set up nurseries that will help improve their 
livelihood. The programme will also help strengthen carbon 
storage activities, mitigate coastal erosion and increase the 
yield of fisheries in mangroves.

Upholding Mental Health and Well-Being at a Critical Time
Recognising that the pandemic had altered lifestyles and could lead to shock, isolation and the inability to cope with life’s 
pressures – all of which could take a toll on one’s mental health, PETRONAS quickly got down to implementing a support 
system to help employees deal with what they were going through. In 2020, we rolled out diverse, flexible mechanisms to 
ensure the mental health and well-being of our people were well looked after. These included:
Over the course of the pandemic, we also issued a series of communications on PETRONAS’ internal platforms and social media 
channels to motivate employees and ensure they were always engaged. Comprising words of comfort, well-wishes and little 
nuggets of advice on a daily basis, these did much to put across the human connection as well as remind our families that they 
were not alone and that they needed to stay fit physically, mentally and emotionally during the trying times.
24/7 virtual counselling support to employees, their family members and sponsored students.
The issuance of the Mental First Aid Tool-kit (Mind-a-Care), as part of efforts to de-stigmatise mental health 
issues.
The rollout of the Eating Right e-Module which advocates the benefits of maintaining a healthy and balanced diet as 
an important factor for attaining a quality life. We also developed an e-Module called “A Guide to Healthy Eating” to 
increase employees’ awareness of the benefits of a healthy diet.
The “Sembang Petang” or “Evening Chat” virtual platform serves as a safe space for employees to voice their 
concerns about their mental health and well-being as well as provide feedback on what they are going through.
The #WeWishYouWell campaign involves 
PETRONAS’ stakeholders from within the 
organisation sending out well wishes to external 
stakeholders wherever they may be to allay their 
fears amidst the pandemic. It is also helping garner 
support and loyalty for the PETRONAS brand.

Enabling Employees to Take Ownership of their Personal Well-being
PETRONAS desires that its employees take ownership of their own physical and mental well-being and we are providing them 
the necessary tools to do this.
Mitigating the Risk of Food Poisoning
PETRONAS continues to work on reducing the number of annual cases of avoidable occupational illnesses such as food 
poisoning. Since 2018, our GHSSE division has collaborated with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and its resources to obtain 
the BeSS (Bersih, Selamat dan Sihat or Clean, Safe, and Healthy) food hygiene certification for the Group’s 64 in-house 
caterers. The BeSS certification verifies that an operator of a food premise has provided food in a safe and healthy manner, 
in compliance with the health authorities’ standards of hygiene. In 2020, we reached our target of obtaining MOH Approved 
Hygiene Standards (54 BeSS and 10 Grade A) for all our internal caterers. Since 2018, there have not been any food poisoning 
incidents related to our in-house caterers. However, in February 2020, there were two separate food poisoning incidents at 
two of our Operating Units. These incidents, which affected 42 employees, were traced back to external caterers. By the end 
of 2020, we had achieved the following milestones:
Strengthening Fatigue Management Efforts
Individuals who experience fatigue often see a decline in their performance and productivity and are at a higher risk of 
being exposed to occupational incidents. To mitigate fatigue-related occupational incidents, the Group has established 
a compliance system called the Fatigue Management System (FMS) 
 that has been in place since 2018. Following user 
feedback and site observations at 53 of our assets, the reliability and effectiveness of the system has been strengthened. 
To date, FMS has effectively delivered the following results:

In July 2020, PETRONAS’ myHealth 
 portal went live, enabling employees to self-manage their end-to-end health assessment 
process. The portal is helping drive a culture of health ownership among the Group’s employees by providing descriptive and 
predictive insights that enable the prescription of appropriate health and wellness programmes to employees based on their 
health risks and needs. myHealth also accords employees a personalised health risk dashboard while an auto-notification 
function reminds employees of the due dates for their health assessments. All in all, the myHealth portal has led to an 85 per 
cent improvement in efficiency and reduced the average health assessment processing time from three weeks to three days. 
Enabling Quicker, More Efficient Health Assessments
This will take the form of a 24/7 holistic digital counselling app that will address an employee’s personal stressors holistically 
as well as provide him or her access to multi-disciplinary coaches who will cover topics as diverse as spiritual, mental, 
physical, financial, social and occupational wellness.
This year, the Group’s Wellness and Mental Well-being Strategy and Programme will be delivered to employees through two 
main streams, namely:

second phase in September 2019. A total of 483 participants took part in the assessments during the intensive and maintenance 
periods of the programme. They successfully completed their assessments in February and October 2020 respectively, four months 
and a year from the time the assessments began. As per the diagramme below, this initiative showed significant improvements in 
the physical and mental health outcomes of the participants.

PETRONAS have benefitted from FReSH:
Prioritising Industrial Hygiene
One of our topmost priorities is to ensure the health of our employees and contractors within and beyond the workplace. 
We go beyond regulatory compliance and implement global best practices to deliver sustainable value and ensure a 
dedicated, productive and high-performing workforce. These include continuous efforts to address all workplace health 
hazards and respective risks such as chemical hazards, physical hazards (i.e., noise, radiation, thermal and vibrations), as well 
as biological, ergonomic and psycho-social hazards.

Noise Improvement Control and Engineering (NICE)
We implemented control measures to reduce over-exposure to noise at source 
or Occupational Noise Induced Hearing Loss (ONIHL) cases once these had been 
identified. Noise reduction measures (via engineering control) are ongoing at 
Sabah Assets (SBA) and PETRONAS Chemicals Fertiliser Kedah (PCFK) Sdn Bhd. We 
anticipate to achieve noise reduction readings of approximately 2.7–28.7 dBA from 
our SBA study and 1.2–31.2 dBA from our PCFK study.
Buy-Quiet Programme
Situational assessments were conducted on six projects to assess the 
implementation of Hearing Conservation Buy Quiet standards within the various 
phases of each project. This is to ensure emphasis is placed on the purchase 
and installation of quieter equipment or machinery as a preventative measure to 
reduce workers’ long-term exposure to noise at site.
Ergo Management Programme
Due to the shift in working arrangements from office to home during the 
pandemic, a Work-From-Home (WFH) self-assessment checklist was released 
that included work area set-up improvements and home hacks. Based on early 
feedback, educational infographics were developed and webinars conducted to 
further enhance employees’ knowledge of WFH ergonomics.
Eyes Guard Application 
The Eyes Guard application, a computer ergo stretch break reminder app, was 
released. The app was piloted at identified departments/facilities to instil a habit of 
taking micro-breaks when reminders popped-up. With the increase of computer/
laptop usage, this app reminds users to take stretch breaks every 20 minutes and a 
brief walk/movement break every hour.
Nano-material Risk Assessment (NaRA)
We established an inventory of nano-engineered materials and conducted the first 
risk assessment at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS. The assessment method uses 
nanomaterial physical characteristics such as water solubility and friability, among 
others, to determine risks to health.
e-Chemicals System
A digital system to track all supplies of hazardous chemicals at site using a 
QR Code was implemented. This system helps alleviate recurring pain points 
related to the periodic review and updating of chemical registers, as well as  
non-compliant safety data sheets and labelling. An upscaled system will be 
integrated with the chemical purchasing process whereby it will screen banned 
chemicals and chemicals of very high concern (CVHC) in tandem with assessing 
their risk as part of the Management of Change process.

Going Beyond Compliance in Process Safety
As we focus our efforts on shaping PETRONAS’ Generative HSSE Culture, we are working hard to link fundamental human 
behaviour with compliance so that every individual within the Group embraces HSSE, particularly process safety, as a mandate 
and a responsibility. 
Being a member company of the Centre for Chemical Process Safety, PETRONAS incorporates industry best practices in our 
implementation of process safety initiatives. The Group has achieved significant progress in its process safety performance 
since the establishment of the programmes and frameworks which enable the early prevention and mitigation of our process 
safety events including Loss of Primary Containment (LOPC) and fire incidents.
Ensuring a Robust Process Safety Framework
The Process Safety Loss of Primary Containment Reduction (PSLR) Framework and 
the Fire Prevention and Mitigation Framework (FPMF) were established in 2017 and 
2018 respectively. Since then, we have seen the number of Tier 1 Process Safety 
Events (PSEs) decrease from 12 to seven cases, or a 42 per cent reduction, over the 
2016-2020 period.

Note:
The updated Number of Tier 1 Process Safety Events for 2018 is due to internal assurance and data verification.
Our proactive efforts in Process Safety fundamentally revolve around risk management. To ensure the Group maintains a 
structured approach when managing hazards and risks, PETRONAS subscribes to the Hazard Effect Management Process 
(HEMP) and the As Low As is Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) principle. The HEMP is a risk management process which 
ensures that hazards and risks to the workforce, equipment, properties, and environment are properly controlled. In instances 
where controls fail, the HEMP helps to manage the impacts of these incidents. Meanwhile, the ALARP sets the level at which 
risk should be controlled. Digital technology serves as a key enabler to facilitate the implementation of this risk management 
process and to improve its effectiveness. In this regard, PETRONAS has embarked on the Integrated Process Safety Solution 
(IPSS) 
 with the successful launch of the Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) and EMOC (Engineering 
Management of Change) digital modules for both our international and domestic businesses in 2020. This is part of our efforts 
to further improve our Process Safety performance in line with our zero Process Safety Event aspiration.
In 2020, we achieved the following process safety milestones:
In 2020, these platforms focused primarily on strengthening the management of COVID-19 pandemic and mental health 
interventions, as well as the prevention of occupational illnesses.
To enhance the effectiveness of the Group’s occupational health and wellness programme delivery, three permanent 
capability building platforms were established in 2020.

As a global operative in the oil and gas industry, PETRONAS is well aware of the various hazards and incidents that our line 
of business has to contend with. In mitigating the disruptive nature of these events, the Group has established a strong 
management system that addresses crisis and incident risk at every level.
The Crisis and Incident Management System (CIMS) forms part of the Group’s HSE Management System (HSE MS) and 
Mandatory Control Framework (MCF). While it is founded on solid governing procedures, this framework is also designed to 
evolve and improve with every incident that occurs. As part of our upscaling measures, the Group runs thorough incident 
investigations and uses the findings from these investigations to enhance the framework. These findings enable us to identify 
the best interventions and prepare the appropriate contingency plans that will help us to minimise the negative impact of any 
untoward incident.
 
When it comes to response procedures, we have developed a groupwide three-tiered response system that outlines 
the various roles and responsibilities relating to emergency site management, operating unit management, as well as 
management of the corporate office and the authorities. In ensuring that crisis-preparedness is kept at an optimal level, our 
facilities and assets are required to conduct emergency drills and response exercises on a scheduled basis. On a management 
level, we assess our emergency-readiness through regular reviews. Furthermore, we utilise digital tools and systems to help 
us track and maintain our contingency efforts.
To help PETRONAS’ Emergency Teams make timely decisions, nine emergency response drills called Hybrid Emergency 
Response Exercises for domestic and international operations were implemented virtually in 2020. These drills complemented 
the PETRONAS Contingency Planning Standard guidelines for conducting drills and exercises. They entailed: 
Complementing Safety Efforts via Virtual Emergency Response Drills
Live and simultaneous data capture.
Integration with the Crisis and Incident Management System (CIMS)  which offers more crisis management 
tools such as Spill Impact Mitigation Assessment (SIMA), Shoreline Clean-up Assessment Technique (SCAT) and a Foam 
Calculator.
For incident management, GHSSE has also developed and introduced an HSSE Incident Management (HSSE IM) 
system 
 that serves as a centralised system to record, report and track actions on HSE and Security incidents for 
PETRONAS groupwide. The system went live on 1 January 2019 and is currently on track for full groupwide implementation 
by 2022. This HSSE IM system is also integrated with a Monitoring and Reporting System (MARS) 
 capability which 
allows users to monitor HSSE incidents from centralised dashboards and reports.
In 2020, PETRONAS collaborated with the PETRONAS 
Leadership Centre (PLC) to enhance the capability of 
our Country Chair and Leaders across the Group via the 
PETRONAS Country Ambassador Professional Training and 
International Networking (CAPTAIN) series. The CAPTAIN 
series is designed to encourage the exchange of knowledge 
and sharing of best practices among peers, experts and 
leaders of the Group. Using a real evacuation as a case study, 
the series strengthens participants’ skills and accords them a 
deeper understanding of crisis and media management.
The Group also accelerated personnel competency by 
facilitating various upskilling programmes for our Emergency 
and Crisis Leadership Teams, as well as Country Contingency 
Teams. The following are some of the year’s initiatives:
Bolstering Our Emergency and Crisis Management Capabilities
Train the Trainer (TTT) programme
76 personnel from the businesses were appointed as in-house PETRONAS Emergency and Crisis Management 
(ECM) Trainers, thereby increasing the pool of Emergency and Crisis Management Trainers.
Gen-R Series (Respond, React and Reliable) programme
8 Gen-R sessions were conducted, increasing Emergency and Crisis management awareness for 1,000 Non-Emergency 
Response practitioners.
Confined Space Rescue Certification Programme
Strengthened the Emergency Response Team’s capability to perform rescues in confined spaces via drills at the Institut 
Teknologi Petroleum PETRONAS (INSTEP) facility. Received site certification by BOMBA for fulfilling Department 
of Occupational Safety and Health Malaysia (DOSH)’s Industrial Code of Practice (ICOP) for Safe Working in a 
Confined Space, 2010. This programme has now become a new course offered by INSTEP.
Throughout 2020, some 5,000 participants benefited from various Emergency and Crisis management training sessions which 
included specialised fire safety and oil spill response training.

As part of the Group’s disaster preparedness efforts, we have published the “Natural Disaster Contingency Plan” that 
provides guidance on managing natural disasters such as floods, tsunamis, earthquakes and tropical storms.
PETRONAS’ flood management initiative continued in 2020 under the leadership of GHSSE and our East Coast Regional 
Office. During the year in review, ERE and training sessions were conducted in order to ensure our readiness in managing 
floods. This involved the FOCC, led by the PETRONAS Regional Office and 23 Flood Operation Committees (FOC) established 
at the respective Operating Units. To support the FOCC, the Group appointed 40 employees as FOC members.
Security
The Group is constantly enhancing its security measures to ensure the safety and well-being of our people, operations, 
information and property. Our efforts are supported by the relevant laws and regulations pertaining to security matters as well as 
PETRONAS’ Security Policy and Security Management System (SeMS).
Natural Disaster Contingency Management
The Flood Operation 
Coordination Committee 
(FOCC) is tasked with 
securing the collaboration 
and commitment of the 
Group’s various business 
entities in the East Coast to 
ensure that our operations 
are well prepared for the 
monsoon season. In 2020, 
the FOCC conducted 
“Ex Tengkujuh III”, an annual 
emergency response 
exercise (ERE) and training 
session as well as organised 
briefing and engagement 
sessions with relevant 
stakeholders including 
government authorities. 
Be it through continuous assessments or innovative improvements, our 
aim is to uphold resilient and effective security controls to safeguard 
the sustainability of our businesses. In 2020, we focused our efforts on 
strengthening our processes and predictive capabilities through a series of 
assessments and follow-up measures.
Security Governance and Assurance
The year under review saw our Security Division under GHSSE completing the assessment and implementation of the enhanced 
SeMS 2.0, whereby the team thoroughly reviewed and tightened sections such as assurance as well as security research and 
analysis. Other improvements included clarifying the role of the businesses in implementing the provisions within the SeMS.
As a follow-up to this exercise, the workings of the revised SeMS were communicated to all businesses. The Security Division 
also conducted targeted engagements on topics such as personnel and workplace security management. These sessions, 
conducted virtually, resulted in the enhanced integration of security elements as part of the larger business decision-making 
process. 
On the Malaysian front, the Security Division was able to fully complete the first and second-line assurance for identified 
assets in the country. We aim to replicate this success across the Group with ongoing improvements to streamline areas 
such as security incidents reporting and security management practices. Furthermore, the identified assets, both locally and 
internationally, have been further evaluated to ensure full compliance with PETRONAS’ Mandatory Minimum Security Standards 
(M2S2). Although the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding movement restrictions impacted our ability to 
undertake physical gap closure assessments, we pursued alternatives solutions via close collaboration with our internal 
stakeholders resulting in successful gap closures.
PETRONAS adopts a proactive approach to risk management to ensure that all potential threats and risks are adequately 
mitigated. In 2020, our Security Division worked on the following:
Proactive Security Risk Management
As our teams went about their duties, particularly during the various phases of the Movement Control Order (MCO) in 
Malaysia, they were accorded 24/7 security support via the Security Operations Control Centre (SOCC).
PETRONAS is currently working towards converging physical and digital security solutions to leverage digital analytics for 
enhanced security management. This is to enable real-time evaluation of security vulnerabilities that can affect PETRONAS’ 
global interests.
Strengthened our capabilities 
in the areas of predictive security 
analysis. This included identifying, 
monitoring and evaluating 
PETRONAS’ vulnerability against 
external security threats to ensure 
foreseeable business risks were 
addressed in a timely manner and that 
the necessary controls were in place.
Provided instantaneous 
consultation and assistance 
on various security-related 
matters. The team leveraged internal 
subject matter experts, including 
forecasting analysts, to facilitate 
effective proactive risk management. 
It also coordinated periodic 
engagements with internal 
stakeholders to facilitate the 
sharing of actionable insights 
to ensure optimum security 
preparedness.

and responsible practices in our security awareness 
campaign to encourage individuals to collectively play 
their part in observing security mindfulness across the 
Group. 
In the year under review, our Security Division actively 
accelerated awareness and education on various 
security topics using various platforms to elevate 
staff’s understanding of security behaviour. These 
platforms encompassed posters, articles, videos and 
staff awareness sessions throughout the year focusing 
on topics such as Security amidst COVID-19, Festive 
Security and SeMS. The team also organised special 
briefing sessions for PETRONAS scholars travelling 
abroad to pursue tertiary education. 
We carried out the “What Security Means to Me” 
campaign which emphasised the importance 
of security in upholding a safe and conducive 
workplace. This groupwide campaign featured top 
management personnel reinforcing the importance of 
proactive security measures from the individual and 
business perspectives. Part of the campaign included 
the implementation of the Security Community of 
Practice where topics such as the importance of 
managing security risks proactively amidst evolving 
externalities; real experiences on how and why 
security matters on the ground; and the realities of 
security threats and risks, were discussed. 
Security Compliance Culture
Integrated Contractor Management System 
(ICMS) 
Overview
A system to screen contractors and prevent any 
blacklisted personnel from entering PETRONAS' premises.
Value Add
Single source of updated information for all PETRONAS 
businesses in Malaysia.
Highlights in 2020
Initiated Offshore/Onshore Safety Integrated System 
(OSIS) to expand ICMS module to offshore operations.
Intelligent Security Operation Centre 
(ISOC)
Overview
A security system that utilises Intelligent Data Collection, 
Management and Analysis to provide strong security 
protection and intervention.
Value Add
• Centralises security information management.
• Improves integration across existing security systems.
• A platform that provides 24/7 end-to-end security 
support.
Highlights in 2020
• Developed prototype for an integrated digital security 
management platform.
• Provided 24/7 security support during the various 
COVID-19 movement restriction phases.
GHSSE also organised a pilot Security Walkabout 
session to reinforce the right security behaviours and 
to ensure provisions within the Minimum Mandatory 
Security Standard (M2S2) were being observed at the 
workplace. Findings from the walkabout were shared 
with the management for corrective purposes. Going 
forward, we plan to conduct the Security Walkabout 
at the PETRONAS Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur and at 
other identified operational assets within Malaysia.
Stakeholder engagement plays a vital role in business sustainability as it offers us valuable perspectives and insights as to 
how we can continue to strengthen our business. Furthermore, it provides us with collaborative opportunities which serve to 
enhance the scope of our operations.
The year also saw us undertaking periodic engagements on security matters on an as-needed basis with relevant agencies 
abroad. Similarly, we carried out consultations with internal stakeholders across our businesses to ensure security controls 
were adequately in place as per the SeMS and M2S2. During identified periods of elevated security, we also sought timely 
advice to ensure additional measures were instituted to correspond with the identified risks.
In 2020, PETRONAS continued to engage with various local and international security stakeholders. In Malaysia, this 
entailed working alongside various external enforcement and government agencies. These collaborative efforts have 
done much to elevate the safety and security of PETRONAS’ facilities, particularly our offshore oil and gas facilities in 
Malaysian waters.
Among the Security Division’s key accomplishments in 2020 was the safe and successful Sail Away of the PFLNG 
DUA from South Korea to Malaysia. It involved a 14-day journey traversing diverse waters between five littoral states, 
undertaking thorough internal risk assessments, as well as striking up strategic alliances and engaging with relevant 
government agencies. Under the watchful eye of a dedicated security escort in the form of the KD Lekiu, the PFLNG 
DUA arrived safely at the Rotan Field - Sabah Waters in March 2020.

Managing Employee Well-being and Sustaining 
Productivity
The year 2020 was truly an unprecedented year for the 
world impacting all aspects of life. As the world went into 
lockdown, PETRONAS responded swiftly by establishing the 
Corporate Command Centre (C3) committee and PETRONAS 
Pandemic Preparedness and Response Team (PPRT). Both 
committees steered the PETRONAS Group and provided 
direction in managing working arrangements.
While the safety and well-being of our employees was 
our utmost priority at all times, we also put in every effort 
to maintain employee motivation and productivity while 
minimising the disruptions to business operations. Among 
the immediate actions we took included:
Onsite work for key operational activities that 
required manning
Work-from-Home/alternate work location 
arrangements for the rest of the organisation
Implementation of special working arrangements effective 
18 March 2020 with split teams:
For more details on PETRONAS’ COVID-19 responses, go to the 
Pandemic Preparedness Across PETRONAS section on page 142.
During the Movement Control Order (MCO) period in 
Malaysia, approximately 83% of employees worked 
remotely. This was carried out seamlessly with 
employees receiving regular updates on guidelines 
and advice to help them adjust to the new working 
arrangements.
Concurrently, a team under the Digital Group also 
ensured the availability of digital collaboration tools 
such as Microsoft Teams and our virtual private 
network (VPN), as well as provided support in 
the form of an online technical helpdesk, while 
ensuring that our digital platforms were secured from 
cyber threats.
Two employee surveys were carried out 
to gauge the implementation of remote 
work arrangements and the results indicated 
that employees found these working arrangements 
‘satisfactory’. The remote work arrangements did not 
have any adverse impact on PETRONAS’ operations 
and the organisation is considering making the working 
arrangements a permanent post-pandemic option.
To attract and retain the best talents, 
we place great emphasis on the well-
being of everyone on our workforce, 
competitive remuneration, a diverse 
and inclusive work environment where 
everyone is given equal opportunity 
to contribute and be recognised, the 
nurturing of individual potential and 
reward-based performance. These, 
among other factors, contribute 
towards PETRONAS’ position as an 
employer of choice.
As of 31 December 2020, our total 
manpower stood at 48,679 employees 
with 85 per cent employed across our 
Asia operations.

Retooling the Human Capital Equation – Preparing Our Workforce for the Future
The world as we know it, is evolving at a tremendous pace and the possibilities are infinite. To prepare us for the future, we have 
taken deliberate steps to Reshape Our Portfolio into one that is of high value and upholds a superior performance. To prepare our 
people for this future with a reshaped portfolio, efforts are underway to Retool and Create a more Agile Ecosystem with employees 
being a key component of the ecosystem to steer long-term growth and sustainability.
Today, PETRONAS is Retooling the Human Capital Equation through three key pillars:
Talent is managed with an end-to-
end approach which is, from hire-to-
retire. This involves talent planning 
and acquisition, talent mobilisation, 
the realisation and nurturing of a 
high-performing culture, measuring 
performance, and rewarding the talents 
for their contributions.
1
Talent Engine
This entails building a sustainable culture 
of innovation across PETRONAS, where 
every employee is empowered with 
the right tools, support and structure; 
they need to think big, experiment with 
breakthrough ideas, and push this into 
production; while keeping the customer 
top-of-mind.
2
Innovation Engine
This centres on creating leaders 
who embody and role-model 
Agile principles and practices by 
empowering teams to plan and 
deliver work, setting up the right 
cross-functional teams for the right 
priorities, and guiding teams to the 
desired outcomes.

I challenge norms and

Courage to Act
I take action to 
progress with pace
In setting up the right culture to spearhead the organisation’s growth strategies, PETRONAS has reviewed its Cultural Beliefs and launched 
a new refreshed set of Cultural Beliefs, which mandate our employees to uphold the following maxims:
The new PETRONAS Cultural Beliefs were launched by PETRONAS’ President and Group Chief Executive Officer, in tandem with the new 
internal Moving Forward Together aspiration. This was followed by eight cascading sessions to ensure alignment across the Group.
Learning and Development
At PETRONAS, we take a holistic approach when it comes to enabling and empowering our talents to develop and nurture their full 
potential. We recognise that a strong pipeline of capable leaders and competent workforce will ensure and reinforce the sustainable 
growth of the Group. As such, we are actively involved in building the capabilities of our talent pool to become a highly skilled, innovative 
and agile workforce by enabling them to self-drive their own career growth in the organisation while delivering on business objectives. 
In 2020, more than RM170 million was invested in learning and development.
In building our leaders, we design and implement transitional leadership development solutions to equip our leaders with the critical 
leadership competencies. One of our signature initiatives is the Top Leaders Dialogue (TLD), a platform that aims to enhance the enterprise 
perspective of PETRONAS’ top 150 leaders through engagement, alignment, and collaboration on business direction. In TLD, our leaders 
are also given the opportunity to engage and learn from well-known leadership thought leaders. 
To ensure the Group’s human capital development is managed more efficiently, we had started to leverage on digital technologies and 
tools. The pandemic accelerated many of these efforts to ensure that talent development could continue. 
We recorded the highest number of active users on our e-learning platform totalling 6,950 in March 2020. Employees leveraged the 
organisation’s e-learning facilities to equip themselves with the necessary skills to help them adapt to the new working norms.
As PETRONAS’ business portfolio evolves, a meaningful part of our business will come from activities beyond our traditional strengths in oil 
and gas, this mean that we will need to build new types of capabilities, adopt new ways of working and establish the right environment for 
our talent to create value and innovate. 
Our talent development efforts moving forward will focus on introducing new skills and tools to shape the organisation’s capabilities to 
deliver breakthrough ideas that meet customer’s needs. We will continue to enhance our digital learning platform to incorporate Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) technology that will help employees identify areas for development and match this with suitable learning plans. We are 
also developing a platform that will match employees’ competencies and aspirations with business needs and career opportunities. This 
will enable our workforce to manage their personal development and drive their careers in a more effective and efficient manner.
In 2020, we achieved the following results by switching to digital learning platforms:
30,268
digital learning users
(2019: 18,100 users)
2,036
users participated in 
assessment and certification 
programmes
11,060
users participated in technical 
training and upgrading 
programmes
47,127
online learning session 
completed
In 2020, we successfully launched and deployed the Superior Managed 
Assessment (SMA) across the Group. The SMA forms part of RESCISCO, an 
enhanced Technical Capability Development Framework and Programme 
that enables employees and their superiors to conduct competency 
conversations virtually anytime, anywhere.
Employees can track, review and analyse their gaps using the competency dashboard and analytics. With this information, employees 
can prepare their Personal Development Plans and self-drive their development. More than half of PETRONAS’ technical workforce have 
carried out their assessments using SMA.
Meanwhile, on the learning front, both of PETRONAS’ technical training and leadership centres have added digital learning solutions as part 
of their offerings to ensure an uninterrupted learning experience for our employees.
At PETRONAS Leadership Centre (PLC) a total of 20 training programmes comprising in-role, competency-based and leadership 
programmes were converted to digital or blended learning experience. Employees were able to leverage the Group’s well-established 
e-learning platform that comes complete with an extensive library of e-learning modules covering a wide range of topics.
During the pandemic, we created new catalogues under our digital learning platform aptly named “Learning During Crisis Edition” and 
“Managing Transition”, which featured more than 100 topics on crisis-related contents.
Meanwhile at our technical training arm, Institut Teknologi Petroleum PETRONAS (INSTEP), we rolled out our first Virtual Instructor-Led 
Training (VILT) within a month after the Movement Control Order (MCO) was announced in Malaysia. By the end of the year, a total of 201 
VILT modules had been developed and 571 VILT sessions conducted.

Generating Value and Innovation from a Diverse and Inclusive Workforce
For PETRONAS to successfully progress, generate value and innovate, we are committed to providing a Diverse and Inclusive (D&I) 
workplace environment that encourages and celebrates diverse perspectives and thinking. By embracing D&I, we are unlocking the 
potential and leveraging on the strengths of our talent. The Group’s D&I Statement encapsulates the aspiration behind this.
PETRONAS Diversity & Inclusion Statement
D&I is about all of us progressing in this world together. We know through experience 
that diverse ideas, views and backgrounds create a more progressive and creative work 
environment that deliver better outcomes; hence PETRONAS believes in unity through 
diversity, whereby we respect and value each other for our differences, yet come together 
as one.
Building and having 
qualified local nationals 
to fill the majority of 
decision-making positions 
in every country we 
operate in and having 
readily available local 
talents to take up 
leadership roles globally.
Creating an environment 
where people feel safe and 
confident to speak up and 
put differing views across, 
to foster creativity and 
innovation.
Providing opportunities 
for representation 
by women in senior 
leadership positions. 
PETRONAS aims to 
establish a pervasive 
culture where women 
can thrive and progress 
with the Group, as we 
build a strong talent pool 
of qualified women.
PLWN made significant progress in 2020 with support from its female and male champions, achieving many milestones 
despite the pandemic.
3
Organised D&I workshops and brainstorm sessions
We implemented a series of D&I workshops to introduce the PETRONAS D&I Statement to employees and discuss on 
the future state of a diverse and inclusive workplace.
D&I discussions and measures were elevated to the PETRONAS ELT and Board levels.
4
Incorporated measurements to gauge results
We established a section in the PETRONAS Organisational Culture Survey (POCS) 2020 to gauge baseline insights and 
interventions.
The PETRONAS Leading Women Network
In 2020, PLWN made significant progress in championing an inclusive workplace through both its male and female champions.
To help us deliver PETRONAS’ D&I agenda, we implemented the following in 2020:
1
Established the PETRONAS D&I Council
Chaired by the EVP and CEO for Upstream and D&I Champion, Adif Zulkifli, the D&I Council comprises members and 
representatives from across our organisation.
The council held its first meeting in July 2020 and met every two months to lead and guide the D&I Agenda, to 
achieve the aspirations of PETRONAS’ D&I Statement.
2
Raised unconscious bias awareness among PETRONAS’ leadership
In collaboration with the PETRONAS Leading Women Network (PLWN), we initiated several sessions to raise awareness on 
unconscious bias among the PETRONAS Executive Leadership Team (ELT), followed by eight virtual sessions with other 
leaders across the Group. 
The sessions were designed to raise awareness on the common barriers that hinder inclusivity by taking the leaders 
through an immersive experience as well as working with them to identify and address unconscious bias in 
the workplace. To make unconscious bias training accessible to all employees, it is infused into other leadership 
programmes. Online learning modules were also made available to encourage self-learning anytime.

PETRONAS Education Sponsorship Programme (PESP) 2020
PETRONAS remains committed to developing future talents for the organisation and industry. Since 1975, PETRONAS has 
awarded education sponsorships under the PESP amounting to over RM3.3 billion to more than 37,000 deserving Malaysian 
students of high academic calibre and with good leadership qualities. We focus on nurturing the right talents who will 
ultimately contribute to the growth of the Group and Malaysia.
The pandemic did not stop PETRONAS from awarding deserving young students the opportunity to pursue their tertiary 
education. The PETRONAS YoungStar Day 2020 annual assessment and selection process was conducted virtually. Students 
underwent an online assessment and group interviews were conducted virtually while upholding the same rigour and quality 
of face-to-face assessments. The virtual platform enabled PETRONAS to reach students across the country in both rural and 
urban areas. We collaborated closely with the state education departments to ensure that less fortunate students had internet 
access to sit for the virtual assessments.
A total of 1,394 candidates participated in this year’s selection process. Some 370 students were awarded the PETRONAS 
Education Sponsorship to pursue their tertiary education in various disciplines. PETRONAS currently has active sponsored 
students under the PESP in the USA, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, China and Japan.
Discover PETRONAS@Schools (DPS)
The DPS programme continues to build awareness among secondary school students about the sponsorship opportunities 
that we offer and the benefits of the energy industry in general. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Movement 
Control Order (MCO), the Digital DPS was launched and conducted virtually, reaching out to 1,924 students. Since 2014, the 
DPS has benefited a total of 17,714 secondary school students from over 300 high-performing schools across Malaysia.
Human Capital Investment
PETRONAS continues to make meaningful investments in its human capital as seen by these numbers to date:
Graduate Employability Enhancement Scheme (GEES)
The GEES programme is a soft-skills and on-job-training 
inspired by the government’s Professional Training and 
Education for Growing Entrepreneurs (PROTÉGÉ) initiative. 
It aims to support the Malaysian government’s efforts to 
enhance the employability of young Malaysian graduates 
and fast-forward the nation’s human capital development. 
In 2020, a total of 140 graduates were accepted to undergo 
the 12-month training programme at PETRONAS with added 
exposure to the areas of entrepreneurship, environment 
sustainability and social impact. A total of 1,180 graduates 
benefited from this programme between 2011 and 2020, with 
71 per cent of apprentices gaining employment.

PETRONAS is conscious of the impacts that may arise from our business and operations. Our Social Performance Framework 
governs how we manage these impacts in these five areas: Environment, Health, Safety, Security, Socio-economic and 
Cultural.
PETRONAS’ Human Rights Commitment
PETRONAS is committed to respecting internationally-
recognised human rights in all areas of its operations, 
complying with its Code of Conduct and Business Ethics 
(CoBE), and all relevant legal requirements.
The commitment applies to all employees of the Group 
of Companies, contractors, subcontractors and any third 
parties within PETRONAS' premises or performing work and/
or business for or on behalf of PETRONAS, in line with the 
PETRONAS Contractors’ Code of Conduct on Human Rights.
While we ensure compliance with human rights principles 
and laws, we also embed industry best practices into 
key businesses processes through PETRONAS’ Social

In 2020, we undertook several social performance measures that reinforced our social licence to operate and added value 
through a risk-based management approach for our overall business.
Social Risk Assessments
We conducted eight social risks assessments within our projects and operations. The results identified that the most pertinent 
risks to our workforce included labour and working conditions, as well as nuisance issues such as noise pollution caused by 
project construction and land issues. All findings were addressed and the risks and issues mitigated.
Third-Party Gap Analysis 
To assess the completeness and alignment of our social risk management processes against the United Nations Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP), a third-party assessment was conducted in 2020 to identify any gaps and the 
necessary mitigation measures. These were among the findings: 
PETRONAS has been actively addressing these findings, which contribute towards the realisation of our Sustainability Agenda 
and Just Transition outcomes.
Grievance Management
The management of grievances 
is an integral aspect of our social 
performance efforts. In managing 
grievances across our business 
effectively, we launched an integrated 
online tool that allows us to monitor 
grievance cases. In 2020, we received 
102 grievance complaints, most 
of which related to the areas of 
labour and working conditions. Each 
complaint was attended to and at the 
same time we made the necessary 
improvements to our grievance 
mechanism as well as the way we 
engage with our contractors and the 
surrounding communities.

PETRONAS Energy Canada Limited (PETRONAS Canada) is 
recognised as a leader in the management of grievances via 
its efforts to uphold exemplary human rights governance 
best practices. PETRONAS Canada operates within the North 
Montney basin in northeast British Columbia, in a region that 
comprises both cities and rural areas. With a dominant land 
position in that resource-rich area, the company is one of the 
largest natural gas resource owners in Canada. 
Being a community-centric company, PETRONAS Canada 
is aware of the impact that its activities can have on the 
22,000-strong population in the region that it operates 
in. As such, it has set in place specially designated teams 
to communicate regularly with its diverse stakeholders 
that include the indigenous First Nations people of that 
region. The Stakeholder Relations and Indigenous Relations 
teams share pertinent information about the company’s 
development plans with residents, landowners, business 
owners and government officials. These engagements 
serve as a platform for a two-way communication in which 
members of the community may share their concerns with 
PETRONAS Canada. The team also works directly with other 
key stakeholders and vendors.
PETRONAS Canada’s efforts are directed by their guiding 
principles which entail how all its employees and operatives 
are to behave and interact with those in the community. 
These guidelines ensure that measures for mutual respect 
are upheld and that PETRONAS Canada maintains its social 
licence to operate.
By combining their stakeholder management system with 
PETRONAS’ grievance management system, PETRONAS 
Canada’s effective management of grievances has seen 
the company respond to and follow up on 100 per cent 
of its grievances cases since 2015. In 2020, PETRONAS 
Canada shared their best practices in managing community 
grievances at the PETRONAS Upstream Community Liaison 
Officer/Grievance Focal Upskilling Learning Series 2020 event.

Positive Social Impact
To ensure our businesses continue to operate in an optimal, beneficial and sustainable manner, it is crucial that PETRONAS’ 
supply chain be managed effectively. Today, we are focusing our efforts on strengthening the entire ecosystem of our supply 
chain via the digital transformation of our procurement processes, forging a resilient ecosystem for the local industry and 
ensuring the Group’s commitment towards human rights is upheld. As we work on de-risking the supply chain, we are also 
moving in tandem with efforts to capture new value through the vast opportunities that are expected to emerge from all of the 
fundamental shifts.
Labour and Supply Chain
We transformed the tendering process from the conventional paper-based process to an end-to-end paperless 
integrated online tendering platform. With its simplified retail-like user interface, the new platform has improved the 
tendering experience. Staff continue to work from home while overseeing and managing tender exercises. Petroleum 
Arrangement Contractors, partners and vendors, have benefited from tapping the integrated platform alongside 
other complementary digital procurement solutions.
We leveraged digital and analytics to improve our inventory planning and ensure the right inventory 
levels. In addition, we embarked on the digitalisation of our logistics operations, including the sharing of 
vessels among our oil and gas assets.
With digitalisation, we have generated savings and value creation for PETRONAS, which in turn allows us to 
sustain our long-term competitive positioning.
We deployed the PETRONAS Licensing Management System (PLMS) in April 2020, which has helped to streamline the 
processes as well as enabled parallel submission and automated data population from the SSM database. With this 
improvement, the registration and licensing experience has improved significantly.
Leveraging on Digitalisation to Streamline and Strengthen the Procurement Process
With businesses having to transform themselves to remain agile and relevant to their markets, supply chains too have evolved 
and become more prolific and complex. To ensure the needs of the Group’s businesses are supported in an effective and 
efficient manner, we have implemented a streamlined procurement digital platform. On top of this, we are creating added value 
for our businesses by giving them the capability to wield powerful insights from analytics to bolster their efforts. 
Digitalisation has been key to these efforts, giving us the ability and agility to adapt and pivot as required, as well as to rapidly 
implement innovative change amidst the disruptions brought on by the external environment. The digitalisation of the 
procurement processes has also increased transparency and improved decision-making as well as governance and controls 
particularly in purchasing and investments.
In 2020, we acted swiftly in response to supply chain disruptions from 
the year’s twin shocks by implementing measures such as diversifying 
supply sources from various geographical locations. Moving forward, the 
real challenge would be on how we respond to the fundamental shifts 
in producing energy, given the acceleration of the energy transition, 
heightened stakeholder expectations and the Group’s aspiration to 
achieve NZCE 2050.
In 2020, we implemented the following procurement measures which delivered tangible results:
Shaping a Resilient Ecosystem for Local Oil and Gas Players
PETRONAS’ humble beginnings started in 1974 when 15 staff with no oil and gas industry experience came together to 
kickstart the domestic business. The Company grew exponentially by leaps and bounds over the years and is today a fully 
integrated oil and gas multinational corporation with over 48,000 employees. In 2020, PETRONAS was deemed the most 
valuable Asean brand in the Brand Finance Global 500. 
Having gone through the ups and downs of the oil and gas business for some time now, we understand the struggles, hopes 
and dreams of homegrown companies aspiring to build their strengths and credentials to become globally competitive 
players. PETRONAS remains committed to helping develop homegrown success stories as this is crucial for the future of 
Malaysia’s oil and gas landscape. To this end, we introduced the PETRONAS Vendor Development Programme (VDP) in 1993.
PETRONAS focuses on nurturing the Oil and Gas Service Equipment (OGSE) and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) 
vendors as well as helping them to take the leap into more complex and higher risk areas of business such as technology 
development, manufacturing, as well as enhanced oil recovery and deepwater exploration operations. We believe that by 
providing vendors a conducive environment, this will spur SMEs and OGSEs to generate value, multiply their acumen and 
develop sustainably.

Established innovative partnerships with nine financial institutions to facilitate access to financing under the Vendor 
Financing Programme. A total of RM1.14 billion in financing was disbursed and 214 applications 
approved for main contractors and sub-contractors.
Collaborated with five investment banks and corporate finance advisors to facilitate vendors pursuing initial 
public offerings (IPOs) under the Road to Bursa initiative. The programme encourages the listing of potential OGSE vendors 
on the local bourse to improve vendors’ resilience and sustainability. PETRONAS has to date conducted IPO briefings and 
one-on-one coaching sessions with vendors who we identified to potentially meet the IPO requirements. We will continue 
to identify vendors with high potential to be listed on Bursa Malaysia.
Introduced the Contractors’ Special Assistance Programme in March 2020 to support the local OGSE 
sector as well as to minimise the impact of the pandemic and low oil price environment on local contractors. Despite the 
challenging market, we honoured all vendor contracts awarded in 2020.
To support vendors that were hit badly by the pandemic, we continued to provide assistance in 2020 through these initiatives:
Published the PETRONAS Activity Outlook 2021–2023 on 31 December 2020 to share the Company’s insights into industry 
trends, demand outlook and the upcoming activities of PETRONAS’ Upstream, Gas + New Energy and Downstream businesses.
Human Rights in the Supply Chain
PETRONAS’ obligation to uphold human rights within our supply chain is guided by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 8 
which advocates “decent work and economic growth.” In support of our goal to create positive social impact, we have adopted a top-
down approach in our dealings with our contractors and suppliers. This approach stems from our recognition of our contractors and 
suppliers as pivotal starting points of influence, which we leverage on to cascade good human rights practices and opportunities for 
growth, down to their respective workforces.
In 2017, we launched our Contractors Code of Conduct on Human Rights (CoCHR), which addresses issues such as labour and working 
conditions as well as outlines the ethical practices that we expect each contractor to subscribe to. This requirement has been embedded 
into our procurement processes in Malaysia, where respect for human rights has become a contractual obligation for all goods and 
services providers who pass through our procurement process.
To help us gauge the rate of compliance with the CoCHR among our contractors, we conducted a digital voluntary self-assessment in 
2019. We ran the second iteration of the self-assessment in 2020 which saw 34 per cent of new contractors respond to the survey (an 
additional 75 per cent of respondents over 2019’s number). We also conducted 22 onsite and remote assessments. The survey findings are 
summarised in the following diagramme:
As we venture forth amidst an unpredictable oil and gas landscape, we remain cautiously optimistic and are encouraging our partners 
to be conscious in managing costs, implement activity levelling to sustain offshore activities and pursue innovative solutions. To 
enhance their competitiveness, speed, accuracy, agility and ultimately resiliency, industry players need to embrace innovation, 
technology and digitalisation which will definitely bring bigger benefits over a longer horizon. The industry also needs to forge 
stronger partnerships that would ultimately enrich lives for a sustainable future. 
The Group, on behalf of the Ministry of Health 
(MOH), was able to procure and deliver medical 
equipment through a robust supply chain 
mechanism, in less than seven days to support 
COVID-19 patients dependent on ventilators in 
Malaysia.
Tapping a Robust Supply Chain 
for Pandemic Preparedness
Based on the survey results, while most contractors in Malaysia comply with their legal obligations, there are still gaps in their respective 
approaches when it comes to effectively addressing matters related to human rights. These include a lack of communication and 
training on human rights among their employees and contractors as well as inadequate grievance mechanisms in their supply chain. The 
assessments did not indicate forced or child labour in the assessed contractors’ labour pool. In narrowing these gaps, we reached out to 
the contractors to address the issues on hand and uphold the importance of respecting human rights. Since then, 16 contractors that were 
previously assessed have reported improvements made in their policy enhancement, grievance mechanisms and training sessions.

Product Stewardship
“Life Cycle Thinking” is an integral part of PETRONAS’ NZCE 2050 aspiration. This helps us to appraise our environmental 
footprint across the value chain and to identify opportunities to create products and solutions that are geared towards a more 
sustainable production and consumption. In this regard, PETRONAS has several initiatives to strengthen our product safety 
and sustainability portfolio including Raw Material Management, Life Cycle Assessment and Product Safety Assessment. 
Raw Material Management
Managing the raw material supply chain is an important element in improving product sustainability in the context of life cycle 
thinking and reducing the impact of Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) risk. We initiated the Raw Material Information 
Request (RAWMIR) programme at the end of 2019 at Engen, and in 2020 it was further expanded to include PETRONAS 
Chemicals Group Berhad (PCG)’s operating units. Through RAWMIR, we have obtained critical data pertaining to raw material 
in terms of composition, physical-chemical, toxicology, ecotoxicology, regulatory and supplier/manufacturer perspectives. In 
2020, a total of 792 RAWMIR documents were sent out to vendors and this elicited an 86 per cent response rate. The RAWMIR 
initiative, which has been extended to the oilfield chemicals segment in the Upstream business and other Downstream 
operating units, is slated to be completed by the end of 2022.
Embedding Product Stewardship in New Product Development
PETRONAS continues to strengthen the management of product HSE risks across their lifecycles, starting from the earliest 
stages of Research and Development (R&D). In this respect, product stewardship requirements were embedded into the 
R&D phase for new product development to mitigate HSE and regulatory risks, which supports the design of sustainable 
products. The scope of the product stewardship requirements includes assessing products for compliance with the relevant 
regulations and application sector-specific requirements to ensure their safe use. In addition, sustainability requirements such 
as product life cycle assessment and selection of safer raw materials are included. The appropriate toxicity, eco-toxicity and 
environmental fate studies are performed in a timely manner to validate product safety and sustainability claims.
Centralised Safety Data Sheet (SDS) Database
Product Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) are the primary means of communicating information on product hazards and risk 
management measures to stakeholders. The development of product SDSs are guided by the fundamentals of the Strategic 
Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) on sound chemicals and waste management. The SAICM calls 
for particular attention be paid to the collection and systems for the transparent sharing of relevant data and information 
among all relevant stakeholders using a life cycle approach such as the implementation of the Globally Harmonised System of 
Classification and Labelling of Chemicals.
PETRONAS product SDSs have been made publicly available on PETRONAS SDS portal (https://sds.petronas.com.my) since 
2014. This aligns with PETRONAS digitalisation agenda by leveraging on an in-house authoring of product SDSs using the 
Stewardship, Health, Information and Environment Linked Database (SHIELD) 
. A stringent internal technical review process 
ensures that the information presented in our SDSs comply with all regulatory requirements.
Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs)
The LCAs are used to determine the environmental impacts occurring across the entire value chain of a product. At PETRONAS, 
LCAs are conducted in accordance with international standards and best practices that support our customers’ sustainability 
agendas and enhances the brand value of PETRONAS’ products.
In 2020, a total of 35 product LCAs were conducted supporting the Upstream, Gas + New Energy and Downstream businesses. 
Out of these, LCAs for PCG’s Glycol products were conducted to provide disclosure on all environmental impact categories 
within the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. LCAs conducted for refinery and base oil products aided necessary disclosures 
towards addressing customer requests. Preliminary LCAs also indicate conformity to blue hydrogen criteria, which creates new 
business opportunities for PETRONAS.
Product Risk Assessment
In support of SAICM, PETRONAS has completed and published the Global Product Strategy Safety (GPSS) summaries, which 
has been made available on the PETRONAS SDS portal  (https://sds.petronas.com.my) for high priority petrochemical, gas 
and refinery products.
The GPSS summaries were developed to provide essential HSE information on products and is also aligned with the voluntary 
Responsible Care® initiative. They also serve as a guide to the public about the hazards and risks of products. This disclosure 
ensures that we conduct product risk assessments with full transparency, which in turn, strengthens public confidence in 
PETRONAS’ products.
Understanding how chemicals affect human as well as 
flora and fauna - and how they behave in the environment, 
is important for effective chemical management. We 
commissioned 29 tests to contract research organisations 
to address customer requests, fill the data gaps, step 
out with new uses for existing products and establish 
preliminary toxicology properties for new product 
development. These tests ensure the safety of our 
products for the intended consumer, ensure we meet 
global regulatory compliance criteria, as well as indicate 
new market and product opportunities.
Product Toxicity and Environmental Fate 
Assessments
Human Rights & COVID-19: Quick Guide For Contractors 
In response to the impact of COVID-19 on businesses, we heightened our focus on ensuring respect for human rights within the 
supply chain during the crisis. Recognising that adverse economic conditions impacting contractors could potentially impinge 
on their workers, we addressed these negative outcomes in our contractor assessments and engagements. We also distributed a 
publication titled Human Rights and COVID-19 Quick Guide for contractors to meet CoCHR requirements. This guide was based 
on the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)’s Human Rights Due Diligence and COVID-19: Rapid Self-Assessment for 
Business self-assessment tool, to help businesses consider and manage the human rights impacts on their operations. 
We will continue to engage with the contractors with the aim of raising awareness on human rights matters.

Safeguarding the Well-being of People Amidst Crisis
During the year in review, exceptional and unprecedented challenges brought on by the twin shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic 
and the oil price rout resulted in many facing an uncertain future in terms of their livelihood. The uncertainty was especially 
prevalent among healthcare professionals and non-medical frontline workers, as well as underprivileged communities.
Considering the fraught economic situation that many were facing, Yayasan PETRONAS stepped up to the plate and helped out 
the affected communities. In addition to its ongoing programmes, the Foundation also focused on initiatives that supported 
capacity-building to help raise the income level of financially challenged communities. These efforts went a long way in bringing 
comfort to the B40 families and those affected by natural disasters.
Yayasan PETRONAS also contributed to the fight against COVID-19 by providing medical equipment and supplies to the 
country’s National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) to bolster the efforts of the nation’s frontliners. The following are the 
highlights of our efforts over the course of 2020:

Yayasan PETRONAS carries out all CSR initiatives under the banner of three focus areas - Education, Community Well-Being 
and Development, as well as the Environment.
Education has always been an important aspect of the Group’s Human Capital Investment 
Programmes since we kickstarted these initiatives back in 1975. In 2019, Yayasan PETRONAS 
partnered with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to reach out specifically to deserving students through 
our Education initiatives. By providing better opportunities for both the teachers and students in 
underprivileged areas, we are helping to close the socio-economic gap for the betterment of all.
Sentuhan Ilmu

Signature Programmes
The Program Duta Guru Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia-Yayasan PETRONAS is Yayasan PETRONAS’ flagship initiative 
through a collaboration with the Ministry of Education (MOE). This programme aims to nurture highly competent teacher 
ambassadors in STEM subjects as well as to enhance Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) through education. We believe 
that by enhancing HOTS in STEM education today, this will help in the development of the workforce of tomorrow that will 
steadfastly build up Malaysia’s nation-building capabilities in the long run. 
The programme aims to equip 4,500 teachers in all 144 districts nationwide and positively impact 3.96 million students. It 
began in 2020 and will be carried out in three phases until 2028. To date, Yayasan PETRONAS has invested RM2.5 million in 
this programme with 135 teachers trained from 112 districts. As 2020 progressed, the programme evolved to help teachers 
adapt to teaching online classes and virtual content. Some 136 teachers from Cohort 1 were also provided with Online 
Teaching Kits that included a DIY mini green screen kit, a pedagogical book Pembelajaran Abad ke-21 (also known as PAK21) 
and a variety of school stationery to help make online lessons effective, fun and interactive.

PETRONAS Counsellors Programme 
The PETRONAS Counsellors Programme (PCP), is a collaboration between Yayasan PETRONAS and the Sektor Pengurusan
Kaunseling dan Kerjaya Murid, Bahagian Pengurusan Sekolah Harian (or Student Counselling and Career Management Unit of the 
Daily School Management Division), which is under the MOE. The PCP aims to help school counsellors in their role of advising 
students on their career pathways, with a focus on STEM as well as Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET). The 
PCP also acts as a platform to spread awareness about PETRONAS’ Learning Institutions such as Akademi Laut Malaysia (ALAM), 
Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP) and Institut Teknologi Petroleum PETRONAS (INSTEP); as well as the educational and 
financial aids that we have provisioned for the students (such as PESP and VISTA). In 2020, a total of 210 counsellors from seven 
states benefitted from this programme.
Construction of Maktab Rendah Sains MARA (MRSM) in Sabah and Sarawak
PETRONAS is funding the construction of an MRSM (or MARA Junior Science College) in Sabah and Sarawak respectively. 
The MRSM Ranau project is a collaboration between PETRONAS, the Sabah State Government and MARA, while the MRSM 
Bintulu is a collaboration between PETRONAS, the Sarawak State Government, Yayasan Sarawak and MARA. Both MRSMs 
have a combined capacity of 900 students (450 each) and are estimated to be completed by 2021. The aim of the project is 
to encourage and promote students’ interest in STEM while developing their talents. Due to the pandemic and the MCO, very 
little progress was made in the construction of these learning institutions over 2020.

PETRONAS, in collaboration with the MOE and state governments of Sabah and Sarawak, also funded the construction of two 
AHLBs or rural day hostels. The construction of the AHLB in Paloh, Sarawak and Pulau Balambangan, Sabah were completed 
back in July and October 2019 respectively, with a total investment of RM8.7 million. These hostels are today providing access 
to education for the rural communities of Sabah and Sarawak, in addition to creating opportunities for the children in Paloh 
and Pulau Balambangan to pursue education in a conducive learning environment. 
Here at PETRONAS, we believe in strengthening the less fortunate communities and equipping 
youth as part of our efforts to accord them a sustainable future. Sentuhan Harapan serves as the 
operational platform on which all the Group’s community-based activities take place. 
Sentuhan Harapan
– Community Well-Being and Development
Signature Programmes
One of Sentuhan Harapan’s signature programmes, the MEKAR (or Memampankan Ekonomi Asas Rakyat) initiative is an 
extension of the Planting Tomorrow programme. MEKAR aims to bring about sustainable economic growth to B40 families in 
both the urban and rural areas. The programme, which was established in collaboration with government agencies to upskill 
communities, offers participants coaching in financial literacy, knowledge on management, marketing, branding and go-to-
market strategy, among others. First rolled out in 2017 as pilot projects for Sabah and Terengganu, the MEKAR programme, 
which was officially launched in 2019, has since been implemented in seven states and positively impacted 3,955 beneficiaries 
to date. Through its various initiatives, Yayasan PETRONAS aims to accomplish the following targets:
The MEKAR Initiative
Improve the Standard of Living:
To provide participating communities with access to basic 
needs such as clean water, electricity (through renewable 
energy) and food.
Strengthen Income Streams: 
To create financially viable opportunities through upskilling 
targeted beneficiaries and providing them with resources based 
on market demand. Focus areas include agricultural skills and 
technology resources, technical services and repair works. 
It also aims to support small business owners selling pastries 
and providing spa services. All in all, MEKAR serves to motivate 
participants and equip them with entrepreneurial skills that 
include financial knowledge and marketing.
Ensure Sustainable Income Streams:
To propagate sustainable income by assisting beneficiaries with 
financial solutions through a buyers’ network, an employers’ 
network and microfinancing. The aim is to increase income by 
50 to 70 per cent over six years, elevating participants’ income 
status from B40 to M40.
Note:
The Planting Tomorrow initiative was implemented by Yayasan Sejahtera Sabah as part of Yayasan PETRONAS’ move to improve access to water in Sabah. Not 
limited to solely providing water access, the programme implements a holistic approach to community development. This approach includes improving sanitation 
and increasing the community’s income through agriculture. To learn more about this programme, please visit

of-inspiration-planting-tomorrow/.
To reach 3,400 beneficiaries in eight states over the 
span of two years.

Yayasan PETRONAS has partnered with the East Coast Economic Region Development Council (ECERDC) in this programme, 
which is part of an initiative to increase the income of B40 participants in Pahang, Kelantan and Terengganu. Participants 
are selected from each state based on a thorough demand and supply analysis. This process ensures that participants will 
have the opportunity to increase their skills development. Upon completion of the programme, anchor companies will be 
appointed to provide on-the-job training, job placement and opportunities for product placement for the participants.
The programme anticipates that some 1,000 participants from districts in Pahang (Lipis), Kelantan (Pasir Puteh and Tanah 
Merah) and Terengganu (Dungun and Kemaman) will be enrolled in 2021. It is scheduled to run until August 2022, subject to 
the government’s decision on the MCO. To date, Yayasan PETRONAS has invested a total of RM 2.1 million in the project.
empowerECER-MEKAR
MEKAR @ Kuala Nerus, Terengganu (Phase 3: Go-to-Market)
As part of our goal to equip communities, Yayasan PETRONAS in collaboration with the NCIA, initiated the empowerNCER 
academic programme for SPM 2020 students from B40 families with a total investment of RM500,000. Utilising an e-learning 
platform, the curriculum comprises the Empower English Attack (eEA), eQMaths, eWorkshops and eSTEM for SPM. The 
programme currently has 750 students enrolled in Kedah, specifically from Baling, Kuala Muda, Pendang, Sik and Yan. With 
a project timeline spanning from November 2019 until October 2021, the programme is ongoing as per schedule, with an 
average attendance of 98 per cent. Post-SPM students will be assisted with placement in universities/technical institutions/
skills programme where suitable.
empowerNCER - Academic Programme
In 2020, Yayasan PETRONAS rolled out the third phase of our MEKAR programme in Kuala Nerus, Terengganu. This saw 
45 alumni from the Planting Tomorrow programme receiving further coaching as they prepared to go-to-market with the 
businesses they had already established. The objective of this programme is to help participants gain market access and to set 
a clear vision for their business growth and expansion.
The business accelerator programme will end in September 2021. Following the completion of this phase, participants will 
have their products ready to be marketed outside their communities, for example, at hypermarkets.
In 2020, a total investment of RM116,325 was made in the MEKAR @ Kuala Nerus, 
Terengganu programme. 
The empowerNCER programme was implemented in collaboration with the Northern Corridor Implementation Authority (NCIA) 
as part of an initiative to increase the livelihood of B40 participants in the Northern Corridor Economic Region (NCER) in Kedah. 
To date, 1,000 beneficiaries, specifically from Baling, Kuala Muda, Pendang, Sik and Yan, have participated in the programme 
which started in August 2019. It is tentatively scheduled to run until July 2021, depending on the government’s decision on the 
MCO. In 2020, Yayasan PETRONAS invested a total of RM2.3 million in this programme. As of November 2020:

Collaboration with Cancer Research Malaysia
In 2020, Yayasan PETRONAS contributed RM4 million to the Cancer Research Malaysia (CRM) as part of the Group’s continued 
support of precision medicine in Asia. As a leading research institute, CRM is actively exploring ways to address the disease more 
accurately in all its stages, from prevention to detection and treatment. The grant enables the establishment of a genetic testing 
laboratory as well as the replacement and upgrading of the equipment that CRM requires. Through this research, CRM aims to 
double the proportion of preventable cancers and save lives, especially among high-risk groups. Ultimately, the institute aspires 
to reduce the guesswork involved for Malaysians facing the disease, leading to a future free from the fear of cancer.

Sentuhan Alam is the environmental focus of Yayasan PETRONAS that aims to reduce the 
negative impact of climate change and the Group’s carbon footprint. Yayasan PETRONAS’ efforts 
in researching biodiversity, carbon sinks and new energy as well as our biodiversity and recycling 
initiatives are in line with the 11th Malaysian Plan that aims to reduce Malaysia’s year-on-year 
environmental impact in a bid to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050).
Sentuhan Alam 
– Environment
Signature Programmes
During the year in review, PETRONAS Chemicals Group Berhad (PCG) organised its annual conservation and plastic usage awareness 
programme called PCG Be Green which aims to promote the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). Established in 2013, the programme aims 
to spread awareness on the importance of recycling and anti-littering as well as the impact of plastic usage on the environment, if 
not discarded properly. The programme involves talks, educational campaigns and clean-up programmes to effectively communicate 
3R education to communities.
PCG first collaborated with Yayasan PETRONAS in 2019 as part of its effort to enhance the programme. The partnership saw the 
introduction of the #recycleforlifecycle awareness campaign and clean-up programme. In 2020, the “Cabaran PCG Be Green 2020” 
initiative was organised under the PCG Be Green banner. Utilising platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook, educational 
content was shared followed by a competition. The campaign offered prizes to those who collected the most waste items and 
then recycled them. The digital format of the campaign strictly adhered to the government’s various COVID-19 standard operating 
procedures (SOPs) which are now part of the new norm. Carried out at four different locations, the campaign reached approximately 
2,880 members of the community and saw 2,000 kg of recyclable waste being recovered.
PCG Be Green
For further details of this initiative, turn to the section titled “The walk4trees challenge – A Good Reason to Keep on Walking” within the HSSE section on page 
146 of this report. 
Yayasan PETRONAS has committed to planting 50,000 trees as part of its environmental conservation efforts under the Sentuhan 
Alam initiative. This initiative ties in with a commitment made by PETRONAS and its employees through the “walk4trees challenge” 
that aims to promote healthy lifestyles among PETRONAS staff, while they in turn pledge to do their bit to care for the environment. 
This programme entails planting one tree sapling for every 1 million steps that participants achieve. 
PETRONAS walk4trees challenge
Imbak Canyon Studies Centre (ICSC)
Launched in March 2019, the ICSC initiative marks a significant milestone in 
biodiversity conservation by PETRONAS and Yayasan Sabah to protect and 
conserve the 27,599-hectare Imbak Canyon Conservation Area (ICCA) in 
Sabah. To spur research activities, PETRONAS, through Yayasan PETRONAS, 
plans for a sustainable model in the areas of conservation, biodiversity 
and community via a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Yayasan 
Sabah. Yayasan PETRONAS also funded the Imbak Canyon Scientific 
Expedition at Gunung Kali Research Station from 18 to 28 December 2019.
Since 2010, PETRONAS has invested a total of RM83 million in the 
conservation of Imbak Canyon. This includes the implementation of 
environmental awareness and community enhancement programmes in 
the area. Plans are underway to introduce sustainability expeditions at the 
Imbak Canyon, whereby the outcomes will provide a database for future 
research on potential commercialisation of these expeditions. For the year 
in review, no activities were carried out at Imbak Canyon due to pandemic 
restrictions.
Total contribution in 2020: RM253,054

Board Governance and Structure
Board Leadership
The Board provides effective stewardship of the Company and is responsible for the Group’s strategic direction and control of the Company. 
The Board exercises this control by way of a governance framework, effective delegation, risk management and a system of assurances 
regarding financial reporting and internal controls. The Board is accountable to its shareholders and towards a wider range of stakeholders 
such as employees, suppliers, community and the government.
Each Director has the duty to act in good faith and in the best interest of the Company. In discharging its roles and duties effectively, the 
Board is guided by the Board Charter, a document which sets out the authority, responsibilities and operations of the Board and well-defined 
Terms of Reference of the Board Committees. The differing roles of the Chairman and President and Group Chief Executive Officer (President 
and GCEO) are acknowledged and set out in the Board Charter.
How the Board Functions
The Board meets regularly and additional meetings are arranged as and when circumstances dictate. Each meeting is conducted in 
accordance with a formal and structured agenda and Board papers are circulated on time to ensure that directors are well informed and that 
debate and decisions are constructive and robust. During 2020, the Board met on 21 occasions, with 100 per cent attendance.
Each Director has full access to the services of the Company Secretaries, who play an advisory role to the Board, particularly with regards to 
the Constitution of the Company, Board policies and procedures and the Company’s compliance with the regulatory requirements, guidelines 
and legislation.
The Board has an approved and documented schedule of matters reserved for its decision. These include approval of the Group’s 
strategy, annual budget, funding requirements, major capital expenditure and acquisitions and monitoring of performance, health, safety, 
environmental matters and risk management. 
Matters Reserved for the Board
PETRONAS is led by a Board whose Directors are collectively responsible for creating and delivering long-term sustainable value for the

Board Balance and Effectiveness
Board Remuneration Policy
Given the highly competitive market, PETRONAS designed a robust fee structure to attract, retain and appropriately 
compensate the diverse and internationally experienced NEDs. The fee framework is illustrated below:
Board Onboarding and Professional Development Programme
The Board recognises the importance of ensuring that new Directors have a complete introduction to the business so that 
they are able to make a full and meaningful contribution to the Board. To that end, the Board has adopted a comprehensive 
onboarding programme for new Directors, including meetings with key senior leadership team, bespoke training on relevant 
regulatory and legal obligations and on Board procedures and processes.
Directors will have full access to roundtable discussions, seminars and other events, covering topics relevant to the Group 
and their roles. The Company provides Directors with the necessary resources to update their knowledge and capabilities 
throughout the year.
A suite of development programmes, known as the PETRONAS Board Excellence has been in place since 2016 to chart the 
Directors’ development plans in a structured manner.

Composition and Independance
As at the date of this report, the Board of Directors of PETRONAS comprises eight members; the Non-Executive Chairman, 
the President and GCEO and six Non-Executive Directors (NEDs), out of which five are Independent Non-Executive Directors 
(INEDs). The names of the Directors together with their biographical details are set out on pages 192 to 196.
The size and composition of the Board is fundamental to its success in providing strong and effective leadership. The NRC is 
responsible for reviewing the composition of the Board and assessing whether the balance of skills, experience, knowledge 
and independence is appropriate to enable them to operate effectively.
The INEDs have been appointed for their specific experience and expertise and are independent of management and free 
from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. 
NEDs may serve on the boards of other companies provided this does not involve a conflict of interest and that the 
appointment does not restrict their ability to discharge their duties to PETRONAS in any way.
Diversity
The Board recognises the importance of diversity and the value it brings to the PETRONAS Group. Diversity promotes the 
inclusion of different perspectives, raising the standards of good practice in Board leadership and enhancement of valuable 
insights in business judgment.
Board Independence
The Board assesses the independence of its NEDs annually. The independence assessment takes into account whether the 
NEDs have demonstrated an independent state of mind and objective judgment in their deliberations and decision-making 
process. The assessment on the independence of the NEDs may be undertaken in the following circumstances:
Prior to the appointment of NEDs, 
the independence of each individual 
candidate will be reviewed and 
determined by the Board based on 
the recommendations from the NRC 
upon reviewing his/her criteria per 
the PETRONAS Independent Directors 
Guidelines.
Prior to the Appointment of 
Non-Executive Directors

The Board determines the independence 
of each NEDs annually, based on the 
recommendations from the NRC per 
the PETRONAS Independent Directors 
Guidelines.
Annual Review

Each NEDs has an affirmative obligation 
to notify the NRC of any change in 
circumstances that may affect his/her 
independence status. Once notified, the 
NRC shall re-evaluate the independence 
status and make the necessary 
recommendations to the Board.

Conflict of Interest
In ensuring transparency and integrity of the decision-making process as well as to prevent any conflict of interest, a declaration 
of interest by Directors is a fixed agenda item at the start of every Board meeting. A Director who has direct or indirect interest 
in a transaction shall recuse himself/herself when required and abstain from deliberations and voting to allow unbiased and free 
discussions and decision-making. Disclosure of the nature and extent of the Directors’ interest and abstention from decision 
making proceedings are recorded in the minutes of the Board meetings. The Principles of Directorship for the PETRONAS Group 
was established to govern the way Directors conduct themselves in a conflict of interest situation, which corresponds with the 
Companies Act 2016 and the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics (CoBE) of the Company.
The Directors are also required to declare their interests annually, in line with the requirements on the disclosure of Director’s 
interests in the Company’s Audited Financial Statements.
Board Evaluation
The Board, through the NRC, endeavours to conduct annual performance evaluation of the Board and its Committees, 
facilitated by the Company Secretary. Evaluation results are reported to the NRC. Individual Director’s evaluation results are 
made available to the NRC Chairman and reported directly to the Chairman of the Board. The Chairman of the Board will then 
conduct feedback sessions through peer-to-peer meetings.

Compliance
The compliance culture is driven with “tone from the top” messaging to ingrain the values 
and principles of conduct that shape the behaviour and attitude of employees at all levels 
of businesses and activities across the PETRONAS Group. This commitment is clearly 
demonstrated through adopting compliance policies and guidelines, conducting training and 
awareness on compliance subjects, establishing internal controls embedded into business 
practices, and performing structured assurance programmes by the businesses to ensure that 
compliance risks are effectively managed in PETRONAS.
Figure 1 
The PETRONAS Legal Compliance 
Framework (LCF) was developed as 
a control oversight and monitoring 
of legal and regulatory compliance 
to the five (5) critical legal areas to 
effectively manage legal compliance 
which embeds and integrates 
compliance assurance and reporting 
for the Group.
The LCF consists of a set of procedures, 
standards, and controls (see Figure 1 
beside) aimed to ensure compliance 
with legal and regulatory requirements 
in the five (5) critical legal areas, which 
pose as enterprise risk to the Group.
These critical legal areas are Ethics 
& Integrity, Data Privacy, Sanctions, 
Export Control and Competition 
which are international laws with 
extra-territorial effect that could 
result in high civil and criminal 
penalties and severe reputational 
impact to the enterprise. The LCF is 
the structured process to manage 
and ensure compliance with the 
legal controls by PETRONAS entities 
within the Group.

Governance and Risk Assessment
PETRONAS has in place the following applicable governance documents in relation 
to the five (5) critical legal areas for adoption and implementation by companies 
across the Group. These governance documents such as policies, standards, 
guidelines, frameworks, procedures and others, form the basis for carrying out 
internal controls across the organisation within the PETRONAS Group.
Training and Awareness
Training and communication programmes are key to raising awareness and 
understanding of the five (5) critical legal areas across the PETRONAS Group. 
Delivery of effective training programmes is high on the agenda for PETRONAS 
directors and staff to inculcate and build strong compliance culture within the 
PETRONAS Group. Despite the global pandemic of COVID-19, PETRONAS has 
continued its efforts by conducting online/webinar training programmes on the 
five (5) critical legal areas. Through our established e-learning modules which 
are specific to the five (5) critical legal areas, PETRONAS staff groupwide can 
further inculcate compliance awareness and depth through various digital and 
communications platforms. This ensures PETRONAS staff are sufficiently trained 
and regularly updated on the five (5) critical legal areas and its related policies and 
guidelines.
Monitoring and Assurance
The governance of business activities and operations at all levels within the 
PETRONAS Group is necessary to ensure compliance with the five (5) critical 
legal areas. To evaluate and monitor compliance status with the five (5) critical 
legal areas, the LCF serves as an assurance program to identify potential areas 
of non-compliance, and/or unsound practices on the status of PETRONAS’ legal 
compliance to ensure effective and informed decision making for the business. 
Conducted and performed by PETRONAS entities within the PETRONAS Group, the 
LCF assurance process is performed, documented and consolidated in PETRONAS’ 
integrated myAssurance platform.

PETRONAS Commitment to Integrity
PETRONAS strives to 
effectively identify, 
prioritize, develop and 
evaluate compliance 
activities to address 
key risks, and to 
document action 
plans related to the 
mitigation of these 
risks. Some of the year 
in review’s business 
practices, which are 
part of the LCF control 
and risk mitigation are 
as follows:
PETRONAS Privacy Notices and Statements for PETRONAS Group
The PETRONAS Privacy Notices and Statements (Privacy Notices and 
Statements) are notices and statements that are designed to provide 
notice of and assist in understanding why and how PETRONAS collects, 
uses and manages personal data, to whom such data is disclosed and to 
whom data access requests can be addressed. This is a demonstration of 
commitment by PETRONAS and will ensure that the flow and management 
of personal data processed by the Group complies with the PETRONAS 
Corporate Privacy Policy, the Master Guidelines and applicable personal 
data protection and privacy laws.
1
Enhancement of the PETRONAS Whistleblowing Policy
Enhancement of the PETRONAS Whistleblowing Policy and 
its procedures is essential to comply with Guidelines on 
Adequate Procedures under Section 17A(5) of the Malaysian 
Anti- Corruption Commission Act (“MACC Act”). The Policy 
encourages staff and members of the public that disclosures 
are secure and dealt with, confidentially, and through our 
accessible whistleblowing channels, which are operated with 
the highest standards of integrity and accountability. The 
Policy provides clarity on the oversight and responsibilities of 
the whistleblowing process, the reporting process, protection 
to whistleblowers and the confidentiality afforded to 
whistleblowers globally.
The PETRONAS Whistleblowing Policy applies to every 
employee, director and officer of PETRONAS. Joint venture 
companies in which PETRONAS is not a controlling stakeholder 
and associate companies of PETRONAS are encouraged to 
adopt the PETRONAS Whistleblowing Policy whilst contractors, 
agents, outsourced workers and business associates are 
required to always act consistently with the applicable parts 
of the PETRONAS Whistleblowing Policy when dealing with, 
acting on behalf of or in the name of PETRONAS.
2
Third-Party Risk Management
The Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) is a due 
diligence process to safeguard the Group from 
any corporate liability that can be attributed to 
PETRONAS arising from the misconduct of third 
parties (e.g. partners, contractors, vendors, suppliers, 
distributors, agents) in respect to the five (5) critical 
legal areas. The TPRM applies to all businesses in the 
Group to detect possible red-flags of potential third 
parties prior to any formal engagement, and seeks 
to provide the necessary mitigation or contractual 
safeguard against any risks of legal, financial or 
reputational damages that may be caused by them 
to PETRONAS.
The implementation of the TPRM process within 
the PETRONAS Group contributes to a strong and 
effective governance and compliance practices in 
protecting PETRONAS from the risks posed by third 
parties.
3
PETRONAS implemented its anti-bribery and corruption programmes and controls around 
the T.R.U.S.T values and principles, guided by the Guidelines on Adequate Procedures.
Throughout the year in review, groupwide communications were high on the agenda with 
tone from the top messaging by the Chairman and PETRONAS ELT. It plays an instrumental 
role in raising awareness of transparency and integrity by promoting awareness campaigns 
entitled “Leaders Speak Integrity” to all PETRONAS employees, with key emphasis on the 
efforts and commitment in implementing best practices and integrity in its day-to-day 
operations and business transactions.
With the LCF as the overarching compliance framework for PETRONAS entities to self 
assess against the five (5) critical legal areas which include bribery and corruption, 
businesses within the Group are able to perform risk assessments to evaluate its current 
state of compliance and to adopt, embed and implement mitigating controls prioritised 
according to internal and external corruption risks.
As a single and exclusive platform to conduct audit and to monitor assurance activities 
for the Group, the PETRONAS Integrated Assurance was established in 2019 to ensure 
effective and efficient assessment of bribery & corruption risks.
Awareness and training programs on corporate liability and 
the importance of compliance to Adequate Procedures for 
PETRONAS groupwide, are carried out through webinars, 
video conference and our e-learning platform with the 
objective to equip PETRONAS’ employees, directors and 
associated person with essential knowledge on PETRONAS’ 
guidelines and policies with respect to antibribery and 
corruption.
PETRONAS has continuously maintained its standards to 
the International Organization for Standardization 37001 on 
Anti-Bribery Management System (ISO 37001) certification 
where it validates PETRONAS’ strategy in implementing 
global best practices to combat bribery and corruption. The 
certification also evidences PETRONAS’ commitment to 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption in a verifiable way and is a 
testament of PETRONAS’ zero tolerance against bribery and 
corruption.
PETRONAS is governed 
by frameworks and 
policies that uphold 
good governance 
which is aimed at 
maintaining a robust 
culture of integrity 
and compliance. This 
supports PETRONAS’ 
zero tolerance against 
all forms of bribery and 
corruption.
Business Practice
Anti-Bribery and Corruption
The PICF, which was established in 2012, is PETRONAS’ 
commitment towards integrity, serving as the framework 
to instill and ensure compliance of all elements related to 
the propagation of integrity and business ethics within the 
business activities of the Group.
As an on-going effort towards PETRONAS’ zero tolerance 
against all forms of bribery and corruption, a reflection of 
PETRONAS’ commitment to high ethical standards and 
anti-bribery and corruption laws, the PICF was strengthened 
to address the requirements of the Guidelines on Adequate 
Procedures under Section 17A of the MACC Act.
The PETRONAS Whistleblowing Policy and 
procedures is available on PETRONAS’ corporate

PETRONAS recorded lower revenue for all categories of geographical trade in FY2020 as a result of significantly lower product prices. At 
RM66.3 billion, revenue from exports remained the major contributor to the Group’s revenue, accounting for 37 per cent of total Group 
revenue. Lower exports revenue was mainly due to the downward trending key benchmark prices for all products coupled with lower sales 
volumes. Compared to FY2019, revenue from exports was lower by 23 per cent.
The year saw revenue from PETRONAS’ domestic operations declining by 31 per cent due to lower sales volume for petroleum products as 
well as lower processed gas demand from the power and non-power sectors following the implementation of the Movement Control Order 
(MCO) as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. This was further compounded by lower product prices.
Our international operations, which accounted for 33 per cent of the Group’s total revenue, saw its revenue contribution dropping by 23 per 
cent as compared to FY2019. This too was the result of lower sales volume following global lockdowns as well as the downward trending of 
key benchmark prices.

Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS)
Integrated Report 2020
220
221
The Group operates three core business segments, namely Upstream, G+NE, as well as Downstream. Corporate and Others, 
which complements our core businesses, comprises the logistics and maritime segment, property segment as well as the 
central treasury and Project Delivery and Technology (PD&T) functions.
Upstream
The Upstream segment recorded a LAT of RM10.2 billion in FY2020 which was primarily due to the lower 
prices for liquids and gas as well as higher net impairment losses on assets. This was partially offset by a lower 
tax expense, operating expenses and cash payments.
Excluding net impairment losses, Upstream registered RM5.1 billion in PAT, which was lower by RM19.1 billion 
compared to the previous year.
In line with PETRONAS’ focus on upholding operational efficiencies, commercial excellence and maintaining 
fiscal discipline, Upstream continued to enhance its strategies to cushion the adverse impact arising from 
the twin shocks on its business. Upstream undertook several tactical interventions including optimisation of 
production, in response to lower demand to protect value.
As a result, Upstream recorded a lower total daily production average of 2,209 thousand boe per day in 
FY2020, as compared to 2,406 thousand boe per day in FY2019.
Refer to pages 72 to 81 for more information on Upstream’s operational performance.

Gas + New Energy
G+NE recorded a LAT amounting to RM10.0 billion in FY2020. This was mainly due to the lower overall 
average realised prices and sales volume as well as higher net impairment losses on assets which was 
partially offset by lower product costs.
Excluding net impairment losses, the segment recorded PAT of RM2.7 billion, which was lower by RM12.9 
billion as compared to FY2019.
In response to the weakened market demand, the segment has established adaptive measures to optimise 
its production profile to ensure the best value for the molecules, while meeting contractual obligations 
to customers. In addition, the business also adopted the agile operating philosophy to ensure value 
preservation, thus mitigating the impact of softer demand and prices on profitability.
Refer to pages 82 to 91 for more information on G+NE’s operational performance.

Downstream
The Downstream business recorded a LAT of RM3.5 billion in FY2020 as compared to a PAT of RM5.2 billion 
recorded in FY2019. The drop in profit was mainly attributable to the inventory and net impairment losses 
on assets, compressed margins and lower petroleum product marketing sales volume.
Excluding net impairment losses, Downstream recorded a LAT of RM1.7 billion, which was some RM7.2 
billion lower than the preceding year’s PAT of RM5.5 billion.
Due to the demand erosion. Downstream undertook swift action to adjust its refineries utilisation based on 
demand and market movements.

Corporate and Others
PETRONAS’ Corporate and Others business recorded a lower PAT of RM0.2 billion, as compared to FY2019’s 
PAT of RM4.7 billion. The lower profit recorded was mainly due to higher net impairment losses on assets 
recognised and provision for litigation claims arising from an unfavourable arbitration result. The segment 
recorded a PAT excluding net impairment losses of RM1.9 billion.
MISC Berhad (MISC) and KLCC Property Holdings Berhad (KLCCP) were the two major contributors to this 
segment. MISC recorded a LAT of RM0.2 billion during the year, mainly from offshore businesses following 
the impact of an unfavourable arbitration result. Meanwhile, KLCCP’s PAT decreased to RM0.4 billion as 
compared to RM0.8 billion in the same period last year mainly due to the loss of revenue from its retail and 
hotel segment due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Refer to the respective 2020 Integrated Annual Reports of MISC and KLCCP for more information.

For the year in review, the Group’s capital investment decreased to RM33.4 billion as compared to RM47.8 billion in the 
preceding year. The reduction reflects the collective effort by all business segments in optimising their portfolios and 
reprioritising projects with the aim to safeguard PETRONAS’ liquidity. Despite the spending optimisation effort, PETRONAS 
continued to invest in key projects which are aligned with the Group’s long-term Sustainability Agenda.

Passionate 
about Progress

theFuture


Cover Rationale
The sheer pace and magnitude of energy transition are rapidly shifting 
how the world consumes energy. Society is demanding for a lower-
carbon future, demonstrating a critical movement for sustainability goals 
to become even more central for governments and corporations.
In fulfilling our responsibility as a progressive energy and solutions 
partner, PETRONAS is committed to providing energy that is affordable, 
secure and sustainable for Malaysia and our customers across the globe. 
By working closely with our stakeholders, we ensure that the oil and gas 
as well as the cleaner energy solutions we produce along our integrated 
value chain, are delivered with sustainability at the heart of our efforts.
Anchored to our purpose of enriching lives for a sustainable future,  
let’s progress forward together and recharge the future for a better 
tomorrow.


We Aspire to Deliver
on Our Purpose:
A Progressive

Solutions Partner
Enriching Lives

Welcome to

Malaysia Integrated
Value Chain
International Asset
Cash generators are existing assets which 
provide strong and stable cash flows. 
Protecting and maximising these assets are 
paramount to provide a solid base for 
profitability and a foundation for growth.

Our
Three-

Strategy


It is essential to expand the core business 
with a lower carbon footprint as it matures 
into becoming PETRONAS’ new cash 
generator.
The strategies are as follows:
Global trends brought on by the Energy 
Transition are reshaping the energy 
landscape, consumption patterns and 
consumer preferences. PETRONAS 
continues to build capabilities and allocate 
resources to step-out beyond its current 
core business.

Sustainability is deeply rooted in our Statement of Purpose, “A progressive energy and solutions partner enriching lives for 
a sustainable future”. As a purpose-driven organisation, sustainability considerations contribute directly to what we do as a 
business, how we operate and how we engage with employees, customers, suppliers, service providers, local 
communities, regulators, investors and other stakeholders.
Scientific findings on climate change are accelerating the pace of the energy transition which demands tangible and 
urgent actions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere. Recognising the signs early on, PETRONAS’ 
leadership has taken progressive steps to position the organisation forward. The leadership team, together with a strong 
mandate from the Board, has announced our net zero carbon emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050) aspiration, the first from 
an oil and gas company in Southeast Asia. We are making this pledge to make a positive change, not only to pursue new 
opportunities in the energy transition, but because a fundamental shift is needed, and the organisation wants to be part 
of the solution towards a more sustainable future.
In stepping up our sustainability efforts, PETRONAS is shaping our approach to net zero carbon emissions and deliver on 
our aspiration. In the process of developing our Paris Agreement-aligned pathways, we will be conducting a systematic 
climate risk evaluation and quantification, as well as reviewing our emissions baseline and strengthening our carbon 
management capabilities. In doing so, we aim to shape our wider ecosystem and catalyse national and regional green 
growth. We are continuously guided by our four sustainability lenses and seven prioritised United Nations’ Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs).

Our Sustainability Agenda


Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
Cap GHG emissions at 49.5 
million tonnes of carbon dioxide 
equivalent (MtCO₂e) for our 
Malaysia operations by 2024.
Renewable Energy
Increase renewable energy 
capacity to 3,000 MW by 2024.
Education Beneficiaries
Reach over 24,000 beneficiaries 
through education programmes 
cumulatively between 2020 and 
2024.
The delivery of our NZCE 2050 aspiration will build resilience and better prepare the organisation and Malaysian value 
chain for a sustainable future. As we decarbonise, we must also create social value and enable progress for society that 
will offer better prospects for more people, with the notion of leaving no one behind, thus promoting a Just Transition.
In pursuing our NZCE 2050 aspiration, we remain steadfast in achieving three short-term targets  
that were set in 2019:
As part of our broader efforts to achieve our NZCE 2050 
aspiration, we are collaborating with various global 
organisations. In November 2021, we endorsed the World 
Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 Initiative and the 
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to deliver greater transparency 
around actions on climate change.
The Zero Routine Flaring Initiative aims to end flaring of 
associated gas from oil production. We have pledged to 
avoid routine flaring in new field developments and end 
routine flaring at existing oil production sites by 2030. This 
is applicable to our upstream operations within operational 
control and excludes flaring sources due to safety and 
non-routine flaring. We will publicly report our flaring data 
on an annual basis, with our first disclosure targeted in 
2023.
We have also announced our support towards the 
recommendations of the TCFD and will work to adopt the 
disclosure framework from 2023 onwards. We intend to 
proactively strengthen our reporting while shaping 
Malaysia’s national climate-related risk disclosures.
In April 2021, we joined other oil and gas companies in 
submitting a letter of commitment to the World Economic 
Forum’s Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics. We agreed to 
adopt the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics in our reporting, 
promote the further convergence of existing environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) frameworks and principles, as 
well as support the progress of a globally accepted 
solution for common ESG metrics. We have published the 
first PETRONAS disclosure on World Economic Forum 
Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics in our corporate website.
Meanwhile our membership in the World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) helps us further 
align our efforts with global best practices, strengthen 
capacity and capability as well as raise awareness among 
leadership on sustainability. Our President and Group Chief 
Executive Officer, and Vice President and Chief 
Sustainability Officer are actively involved as Council 
Member and Liaison Delegate respectively. Additionally, our 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer is part 
of the WBCSD Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Network, and 
our Senior Vice President Group Human Resource 
Management is a member of the WBCSD Business 
Commission to Tackle Inequality.
Our President and Group Chief Executive Officer also 
chairs the CEO Action Network, a coalition of leaders of 
major Malaysian businesses that focus on sustainability 
advocacy, capacity building, action, and performance 
improvements.

Dear Stakeholders,
We are pleased to present the PETRONAS Integrated Report 2021, which showcases our performance in creating 
financial and non-financial values for our stakeholders during the year. The report aims to offer a balanced 
assessment of our performance, progress and future direction. We continue to make great strides as a progressive 
energy and solutions partner; developing meaningful relationships with our stakeholders to create sustainable value 
and Recharge the Future.
While we are not a public listed company, we are committed to this process as a means of adding value for our 
stakeholders as it creates better visibility, transparency and allows an informed assessment of our operations.
Scope and Boundaries
The PETRONAS Integrated Report is produced and 
published annually, covering the full calendar year from 
1 January to 31 December 2021, unless stated otherwise. 
The report covers all our operations and activities across 
PETRONAS and its subsidiaries (PETRONAS Group), joint 
operations and associates.
This report extends beyond financial reporting. It includes 
our non-financial performance, governance, key strategies, 
material topics, risks and opportunities, as well as 
stakeholder value creation. The non-financial data in 
this report includes data from our owned and operated 
businesses, in line with industry best practices. It does not 
include data from equity interest fields/projects, such as 
joint ventures, where we do not have operational control. 
Those areas that we do not have operational control over 
are included in disclosures of the management approach.
Reporting Frameworks
This report is guided by local and global standards, including:
• The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) 
<IR> Framework, a principles-based approach that 
promotes the six capitals concept and considers 
material inputs as well as resources required to create 
and sustain value in the long term.
• International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
• Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards (MFRS).
• Ipieca/API/IOGP Sustainability reporting guidance for the 
oil and gas industry.
• Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards.
• World Economic Forum's Stakeholder Capitalism 
Metrics.
Sustainability Reporting
We aim to embed sustainability consistently into our 
business strategy and decisions. We see this as an 
essential component of our value creation. By focusing on 
responsible environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
practices, we are better able to create long-term value 
for all stakeholders. With this in mind, this report includes 
our sustainability aspiration and performance aligned with 
relevant international standards. Additionally, we seek to 
demonstrate how our business strategy and initiatives 
contribute to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs).
Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains forward-looking statements. Words 
such as “believe”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “seek”, “will”, “plan”, 
“could”, “may”, “endeavour” and similar expressions are 
intended to identify such forward-looking statements 
but are not the exclusive means of identifying such 
statements. By their nature, forward-looking statements 
involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future 
events and circumstances and should be considered 
in light of the various important factors. While these 
forward-looking statements represent our judgements and 
future expectations, a number of risks, uncertainties and 
other important factors could cause actual developments 
and results to differ materially from our expectations.
The key factors that could cause our actual performance 
or achievements to differ materially from those in the 
forward-looking statements include changes to IFRS and 
associated interpretations, applications and practices as 
they apply to past, present and future periods; ongoing 
and future acquisitions; changes to domestic and 
international businesses and market conditions such as 
exchange rate and interest rate movements; changes 
in domestic and international regulatory and legislative 
environments; changes to domestic and international 
operational, social, economic and political conditions; any 
labour disruptions and industrial action; and the effects of 
both current and future litigations.
Assurance
The financial information contained in this report, which 
has been extracted from the consolidated Audited 
Financial Statements for the financial year ended 
31  December 2021, and was audited by KPMG PLT.
We have also completed third party verification for the 
Lifecycle Carbon Footprint (partial CFP) for PC Ethylene 
products by DNV, USA. This increases the credibility of 
internally conducted Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) towards 
our disclosure to stakeholders, particularly customers.

Brand Positioning: “Passionate About Progress”
Our long track record as a global energy and solutions partner
which is driven by a dedicated team of people
supports our expanding business and portfolio
and expansive global reach
and underpinned by responsible governance
Since 1974, we have transformed PETRONAS from a domestic-based national oil company 
into a fully integrated oil and gas multinational corporation. This experience has provided us 
with the winning formula to drive the transition to a lower carbon economy and further 
contribute to societal progress. 
People are our strength and partners for growth, driving our passion for innovation to 
progress towards sustainable energy solutions. Our 46,884 employees worldwide continue to 
be at the forefront of executing our strategic objectives, equipped with the skills and 
expertise to thrive in a lower-carbon future.
We have a long history of success in exploration, development and production of crude oil

we have grown our solar capacity in operation and under development to close to 
1  GW locally and internationally, reinforcing our position as one of the key clean 
energy providers in the region.

Dear Stakeholders,
Two years have passed since the pandemic began, and our world continues to be 
challenged by volatility and uncertainty on an unprecedented scale in living memory. Even 
as countries and industries alike strive to recover from the brutal impact of COVID-19, they 
now face newfound challenges in the wake of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict whose 
consequences may well long outlast the hostilities themselves and which are likely to 
reshape the industry landscape in fundamental and complex ways.

Integrated Report 2021


Reflecting on 2021
PETRONAS’ performance for the year in review 
demonstrates its relentless focus on operational 
and commercial excellence across the Group. 
The organisation ensured the reliability of its 
operations to leverage the recovery in global 
energy demand seen in 2021 with the safety of 
our people and assets as its highest priority.
Although some degree of stabilisation was seen 
with the rollout of vaccinations and economies 
recovering from easing of lockdowns and 
gradual removal of border restrictions, 
delivering the Group’s performance did not 
come easily. During the year, the oil and gas 
industry continued to be very volatile and 
uncertain in the face of sudden shocks to the 
market, many of which were beyond our 
control. These included:
1 
The threat of new and highly infectious 
COVID-19 variants derailing economic 
recovery which proved to be of grave 
concern for the safety of our people and 
its impact on our supply chain.
2 
The oil and gas industry remaining fragile 
as the rebound in oil price was driven by 
the multi-speed reopening of economies, 
steadfast active market management by 
OPEC+ and an unfolding global energy 
supply crisis.
3 
The increasing pace of the energy 
transition causing sustainability-driven 
structural changes to our industry with 
stakeholders demanding more visible, 
impactful results in our efforts to 
decarbonise.
Notwithstanding the prevailing uncertainties, the role that 
PETRONAS plays as an energy company in the context of the 
wider society remains clear – namely, that it continues to 
serve as an effective engine that drives economic recovery 
for Malaysia and beyond by ensuring the safe, secure and 
reliable supply of energy, while taking vital steps that pave 
the way to gradually transition to a lower-carbon future in a 
just and equitable way.
In our efforts to fulfil this role, PETRONAS remains 
unwavering in the delivery of its amanah (trust), always 
striving to dutifully discharge its obligations and 
responsibilities despite the overwhelming odds and challenges. 
With prudent financial management and an unyielding 
commitment to upholding safety performance as well as 
delivery of commercial and operational excellence, PETRONAS 
registered a strong performance in 2021 after two years of 
extreme disruptions to the energy ecosystem. This 
achievement by the Group is credited to the courage, 
dedication and tenacity of our people. In this opportunity, 
I  would also like to thank our stakeholders for their support 
and assistance that allowed us to continue operating safely 
and optimally throughout the lockdown periods.
Looking ahead, changes in the energy landscape will provide 
new challenges and growth opportunities that we must 
approach with a credo and mindset for progress and 
innovation. To this end, I am confident that with the right 
steer and support from the Board, PETRONAS is well-
positioned to progress with pace and resilience to deliver 
profitable and sustainable growth aligned to our Three-
Pronged Growth Strategy and net zero carbon emissions by 
2050 (NZCE 2050) aspiration.

Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS)
Letter from the Chairman


Nevertheless, PETRONAS successfully demonstrated its ability to respond and 
become part of the solution. Together, the PETRONAS Board and Leadership Team 
were able to not only preserve and enhance its core oil and gas portfolio but also 
grow in the new energy space for long-term business sustainability and resiliency.
As a result, PETRONAS was able to generate healthy financial returns and 
contribute to its stakeholders in the form of cash payments, tax, export duties, 
state sales tax and dividends. In 2021, we paid the scheduled RM25 billion dividend 
payments to the Government of Malaysia.
Accelerating Sustainability
As a National Oil Company, hydrocarbons will still be part of our energy mix even 
as we seek to integrate renewables and lower-carbon solutions as well as specialty 
chemicals into our portfolio in a gradual and phased manner. It remains our duty 
to maximise the value of Malaysia’s hydrocarbon resources to provide long-term 
economic value creation for shared prosperity and energy security – this, while 
also contributing to the low-carbon aspirations of the nation.
Reaching net zero carbon emissions is a monumental undertaking and requires a 
steady, evolutionary approach of continuous improvements on emissions reduction. 
For PETRONAS, we have responded decisively to accelerated energy transition with 
clarity and discipline with our 2024 sustainability targets and carbon commitments, 
supported by the right ecosystem for growth. We are making progress on zero 
venting and flaring, operational improvements, electrification and developing lower 
carbon solutions.
It remains our duty 
to maximise the 
value of Malaysia’s 
hydrocarbon 
resources to provide 
long-term economic 
value creation for 
shared prosperity 
and energy security 
– this, while also 
contributing to 
the low-carbon 
aspirations of the 
nation.

To enhance these efforts and further entrench 
momentum, the PETRONAS Board has expressed its 
support to incorporate environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) elements in our assessments of 
future investments in which decisions would consider 
value-creation from the perspective of the 3Ps of 
sustainability – people, planet and profits.
With the significant progress achieved under our core 
portfolio in 2021, PETRONAS will continue to focus on 
building a resilient portfolio that is not only robust to 
the energy transition but also captures attractive 
business opportunities which the transition presents. 
Since we announced our NZCE 2050 aspiration last 
year, the Group has undertaken deliberate steps in 
moving from a commodity player to a customer-centric 
solutions provider. PETRONAS’ roadmap for our NZCE 
aspiration will see the organisation play its part in 
moving the needle towards the goal of net zero, 
contributing to Malaysia’s Nationally Determined 
Contributions (NDC) to the Paris Agreement for the 
long-term, while supporting our customers in 
decarbonising their energy systems.
Reinforcing Strong Governance
In an increasingly challenging environment 
characterised by market uncertainties and heightened 
geopolitical risks, PETRONAS must continue to reliably 
demonstrate its ability to deliver its core responsibilities 
while transforming to meet the energy needs of the 
future.
PETRONAS holds Malaysia’s hydrocarbon resources in 
trust, and we have always striven to ensure its potential 
continues to be harnessed for the benefit of the people 
and the nation. Similarly, in our global ventures, we 
have sought to build partnerships and gain hand-in-
hand support from our partners as well as customers in 
our journey towards progress.
With a strong foundation built on trust, PETRONAS has 
successfully balanced its unique position to fulfil its 
commitment as Malaysia’s NOC while living up to the 
demanding expectations of being an international 
energy player. Over the years, our stakeholders have 
given us the opportunity to serve and create new value 
as their partners in progress, allowing us to continue 
growing as a FORTUNE Global 500 company.

Delivering Our Amanah to The Nation
As we set out to serve our stakeholders safely and reliably, 
PETRONAS has never wavered from its commitment to 
ensure the well-being of society wherever we operate. 
Anchored on our Statement of Purpose, we recognise the 
importance of enriching the lives around us, especially in 
these prolonged trying times.
In 2021, PETRONAS’ CSR contribution which is focused on 
Education, Community Well-being and Development, and 
the Environment totalled RM1.4 billion in a span of two 
years alone.
Following last year’s efforts, we continued to support 
COVID-19 relief initiatives at home and abroad where we 
operate, amounting to more than RM75 million in 2021. 
Among the efforts were repeated contributions to the 
National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) funds 
through staff and corporate donations, Program Bakul 
Prihatin Negara, and Program CERDIK, as well as the 
contribution of essential items to hospitals and 
communities to help ease the burden in coping with the 
effects of COVID-19.
PETRONAS also supported the Government of Malaysia’s 
vaccination drive with the setup of six Pusat Pemberian 
Vaksin Industri (PPVIN) for the oil and gas sector. This is in 
line with our commitment to provide a safer environment 
within the oil and gas ecosystem by achieving herd 
immunity for its frontliners. We donated wheelchairs to 
Pusat Pemberian Vaksin (PPV) through Yayasan PETRONAS 
and also launched the PETRONAS Foodbanks at our Mesra 
stations across Malaysia. It was indeed heartening to see 
our people stepping up to adopt the Foodbanks, pooling 
their own resources to ensure a continuous and 
sustainable supply of essential items to the needy. Our 
people continued to demonstrate exemplary courage by 
banding together to lend a helping hand when Malaysia 
endured the effects of a devastating flood in December 
that severely affected up to eight States. The organisation 
actively participated in relief efforts and contributed RM25 
million to assist the Government of Malaysia with post-
flood recovery.
As we embrace a more enterprising way of work and 
position ourselves to seize opportunities for future growth, 
PETRONAS will continue to uphold the highest standards 
of governance and integrity as a culture in everything that 
we do. With our global footprint and commitment to 
enriching the lives of those around us, we must do our 
very best to strengthen our commitment to integrity at 
both individual and organisational levels. PETRONAS adopts 
zero tolerance standards on corruption, and a strict 
consequence management approach should the 
boundaries be crossed.
The foundational integrity embedded in our Shared Values 
along with Loyalty, Professionalism and Cohesiveness are 
the core principles of work ethics for all employees. We 
have in place a Corporate Governance framework and 
introduced our Code of Business Ethics (CoBE) in 2012 
accompanied by an Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy & 
Guidelines Manual. We have continued to step up our 
collaboration with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption 
Commission (MACC) to develop adequate measures as 
defined by Section 17A of the MACC Act.
In 2021, significant initiatives were implemented to 
strengthen groupwide awareness of the CoBE and the 
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Manual. This will empower 
employees to speak up on any wrongdoing, facilitated 
under the Whistleblowing Policy, to ensure secure and 
confidential disclosures.
A Leaders Speak Integrity series was also launched as a 
platform for leaders to pledge their commitment towards 
integrity and rally employees to always aim for exemplary 
conduct at all levels as a collective responsibility. Virtual 
dialogues were also held to provide a safe space for 
employees to discuss integrity-related topics.
I am also pleased to share that PETRONAS is a signatory 
of the World Economic Forum’s Partnering Against 
Corruption Initiative (PACI). As part of the PACI Vanguard 
Board, PETRONAS leverages on the platform to collaborate 
with leaders from international organisations, academia and 
civil society to address and advocate the importance of 
anti-corruption measures, upholding business integrity, 
transparency, and accountability.
To this end, I would like to assure that the PETRONAS 
Board is wholly committed to upholding the highest 
standards of governance and steadfastly supports all Group 
initiatives on integrity-related matters.

Letter from the Chairman


Despite the cyclical and volatile swings in the energy 
market, I would like to reiterate that PETRONAS will 
continue giving back to society towards creating positive 
social impact for Malaysians and the countries where we 
operate.
In 2021, the organisation awarded 302 scholarships via the 
PETRONAS Education Sponsorship Programme and 
enhanced the technical and vocational capabilities of 93 
students through the PETRONAS Vocational Institution 
Sponsorship & Training Assistance (VISTA) programme to 
nurture a market-ready future workforce.
PETRONAS expanded its community well-being and 
development programmes in South Sudan with the Water 
for Life programme which provides rural communities with 
access to clean water. Closer to home, a Solar Systems 
Project was launched to provide electricity to Kampung 
Orang Asli in Berasau, Johor. In collaboration with Tata 
Consultancy Services, PETRONAS onboarded 50 social 
entrepreneurs to SEEd.Lab, a social enterprise innovation 
hub to address youth unemployment in Malaysia through 
entrepreneurial opportunities.
Our ability to uplift societies to achieve a better and 
sustainable quality of life has been through effective 
collaboration. PETRONAS has long viewed its relationship 
with stakeholders as a partnership underpinned by 
common objectives and sustained by mutual 
understanding, respect and trust.
For a partnership to be successful for the long-term 
especially at a time of uncertainty and turbulence, the 
aspirations of each party which include industry partners, 
Oil & Gas, Services and Equipment (OGSE) players, 
customers, the community and indeed governments must 
be duly recognised, and the right balance achieved to 
produce outcomes that prove mutually beneficial for all.
On our part, PETRONAS will continue to adapt and 
transform to safeguard its ability to uphold the amanah to 
our nation and the well-being of the people around us, 
and we welcome meaningful participation as well as 
genuine support from all parties to ensure effective 
contributions that create value as we forge ahead together.

Moving Forward with Purpose
The year 2021 has proven that we need to constantly be 
prepared to pivot when faced with the unexpected. The 
unprecedented challenges of the past year offered 
PETRONAS an opportunity to reform strategies, expedite 
transformation and prioritise sustainability risks. It was 
imperative that PETRONAS emerged from this trying period 
more resilient, more agile, technologically stronger and 
financially more robust.
The achievements of 2021 demonstrate the dedication and 
strength of our people coupled with a robust integrated 
portfolio that provided PETRONAS with the strong 
foundation it needed to capitalise on price recovery. I am 
deeply grateful to the women and men who stood by 
PETRONAS amidst the turbulence and offer my sincere 
thanks to each and every one of them.
As we progress to capitalise on this period, PETRONAS will 
continue in its efforts to safely deliver commercial and 
operational excellence. We remain focused on maintaining 
fiscal discipline and careful operational spending as well as 
preserving liquidity to ensure resiliency and high 
performance across the Group. We are determined to seize 
new opportunities for sustainable, profitable growth as we 
uphold our commitment to our shareholder and lay the 
foundation for our future growth.
The PETRONAS of the future will still have hydrocarbons 
as a key part of its portfolio with products delivered safely, 
responsibly, cost optimised, and emissions abated. The new 
forays that we are making in step-outs today will 
complement our core portfolio to provide energy for a 
world that continues to progress and develop, while being 
in ever-greater need of solutions for emissions.
While the variety of our business offerings expands, the 
heart of the organisation, in its purpose and values are 
timeless and remain the same. Our Purpose, Cultural 
Beliefs, and Shared Values of Loyalty, Integrity, 
Professionalism and Cohesiveness will continue to bind us 
together.
PETRONAS will continue in its efforts to safely 
deliver commercial and operational excellence.

Looking ahead, the pressures on PETRONAS are only going 
to increase as we continue to bear the expectations and 
aspirations of Malaysia and the communities where we 
operate. We must make our move to navigate through the 
turbulence to find our position for the future. In our quest 
to create a sustainable legacy for the next generation, we 
must steer the business and shape an energy future that 
they deserve, one in which PETRONAS will continue to be 
their preferred energy and solutions partner.

On behalf of the PETRONAS Board, I would like to take 
this opportunity to record my sincere appreciation to Tan 
Sri Ahmad Nizam Salleh for all his contributions as 
Chairman since August 2018 and wish him every success 
in his new undertakings. I would also like to extend a 
warm welcome to three of our Directors who joined the 
Board during the year – namely, Mr Thayaparan S. 
Sangarapillai as Independent Non-Executive Director, 
Chairman of the Risk Committee and a member of the 
Audit Committee; Puan Liza Mustapha as Executive 
Director; and Datuk K Y Mustafa as Non-Independent and 
Non-Executive Director. I am confident that their collective 
experiences and diverse insights will be valuable additions 
in providing the right steer for the Group, especially as we 
navigate through these challenging times.
Furthermore, I would like to thank Datuk Tengku 
Muhammad Taufik, President and Group CEO of 
PETRONAS, and his Leadership Team for ensuring the 
company continues to dutifully discharge its obligations 
and responsibilities despite facing overwhelming odds and 
challenges. My deepest gratitude also to our employees for 
their perseverance in upholding the trust as we continue 
to brave these trying times.
Finally, I would like to express my deep gratitude for our 
valued stakeholders – the Federal Government of Malaysia, 
State Governments and the Governments of our Host 
countries, industry partners and customers for their strong 
support and understanding during these times of prolonged 
turbulence and uncertainty. With your trust and confidence 
in PETRONAS, I am optimistic that we will continue to 
grow and deliver the energy for today and tomorrow, as 
your progressive energy and solutions partner.

The Group is fully committed 
to remain disciplined in its 
delivery of our Three-Pronged 
Growth Strategy, and resolute 
in our efforts to achieve the 
goal of net zero carbon 
emissions by 2050.
Even as we contend with this volatile period, 
PETRONAS’ priority remains to ensure the security of 
energy supply for Malaysia and our customers around 
the world. The Group is fully committed to remain 
disciplined in its delivery of our Three-Pronged 
Growth Strategy, and resolute in our efforts to achieve 
the goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 (NZCE 
2050).
In discharging this daunting responsibility, I am 
pleased to report that PETRONAS delivered a strong 
performance in 2021. The results were delivered under 
challenging circumstances faced by every member of 
the PETRONAS family as the threat of the COVID-19 
pandemic remains ever present in our day-to-day 
operations. It is with great pride that I am able to 
report that given the unwavering contribution and 
support of PETRONAS’ employees and its partners, the 
Group remained on steady footing to weather possible 
market shocks. Given the resilience on display, 
I  remain confident that PETRONAS can, and indeed 
will, continue to deliver even more meaningful results 
as a progressive energy and solutions partner 
enriching lives for a sustainable future.
Upholding the Safety of Our People
Upholding our people’s safety is PETRONAS’ top priority. 
In  2021, the Group ensured operations continued to run 
safely, reliably and efficiently with minimal interruptions. 
Across our operations, significant efforts were undertaken 
where work practices were modified to build safe working 
environments and quality processes in accordance with 
COVID-19 guidelines, upholding zero compromises on 
safety and integrity.
Although Major Fire was contained to one incident, the 
lowest in the past 12-year period, we remain susceptible to 
high-risk situations in our work. Regrettably, we lost three 
colleagues in the line of duty. The Safety Stand Down was 
held for the Group to reflect on the incidents and its root 
causes. I cannot emphasise enough that we must learn 
from these incidents and do everything possible in 
strengthening a safe working environment and culture 
where everyone goes home safely.
Extensive vaccination programmes were also rolled out for 
employees, contractors and the community where we 
operate. Sadly, 64 deaths involving staff and contractors 
were recorded cumulatively due to COVID-19 since the

Executive Officer
Esteemed Stakeholders,
As we are now all too aware, recent events 
have overtaken the brief respite which the 
oil and gas industry experienced in 2021, 
following the unprecedented challenges of 
2020. The impact of the tragic conflict 
between Russia and Ukraine, which 
continues to unfold as I write this, is still 
being felt globally and it is our hope that a 
peaceful resolution will be achieved soon.
This conflict has roiled energy markets and 
has presented fresh uncertainties that 
threaten an already uneven and extremely 
fragile post-pandemic recovery. Driven by 
heightened concern over disruption in 
energy supply in a market already facing 
structural supply issues, prices for human 
sustenance and economic activity have 
escalated to record highs- presenting even 
more complex challenges and added 
uncertainty to the economic recovery.
pandemic started. Recognising the psychological impact of 
COVID-19 on mental health, various targeted interventions 
focused on employees’ mental well-being were also 
implemented to provide employees with access to trained 
professionals to improve their physical and mental health.
By the end of 2021, the Group achieved 80 per cent 
vaccination and booster rates for employees. These 
deliberate efforts were absolutely essential for PETRONAS 
to continue serving our customers safely and efficiently, 
ensuring their energy security as we weathered the 
unavoidable challenges of operating during a pandemic.
Strengthening Our Core and Growth Portfolio
PETRONAS recorded a commendable performance in 2021, 
significantly outperforming the previous reporting year. We 
achieved RM48.6 billion in Profit After Tax (PAT), in marked 
contrast to a Loss After Tax of RM21.0 billion in 2020. 
Revenue stood at RM248.0 billion in 2021.
The sustained operational resilience demonstrated by the 
Group contributed to its strong performance, further 
supported by surging commodity prices driven by the 
recovery in global energy demand as key economies 
reopened and travel restrictions eased amid higher 
COVID-19 vaccination rates around the world.
The results we registered for the year in review 
demonstrated the unwavering dedication of the PETRONAS 
workforce and the robustness of the Group’s integrated 
portfolio. We remained resilient through two years of 
extreme disruptions to the energy ecosystem, eventually 
benefiting from the oil price and market recovery. Our 
consistent emphasis on ensuring strong integrated 
operational performance enabled us to maximise our cash 
generators.

recognising this, PETRONAS will continue to focus and 
amplify its efforts towards the decarbonisation of our 
operations and seize new areas for growth. The Group will 
execute this even as it steadfastly adheres to ensure safety 
in pursuit of commercial and operational excellence. We 
will continue to exercise firm discipline when reinvesting to 
strengthen our core and grow our portfolio, given our 
responsibility to prudently manage our financial 
commitments and debt obligations.
During the year in review, PETRONAS also continued with 
its practice of enforcing effective portfolio management. It 
is necessary to emphasise that continuous portfolio 
management is part and parcel of any commercial entity’s 
ongoing obligation to its shareholders. This ensures the 
assets under its care are capable of generating the required 
returns from the capital it deploys, given the risks it 
expects to undertake.
To this end, the Board of PETRONAS regularly examines 
the Group’s portfolio and determines candidates for both 
growth and divestment. The recent conclusion of our

divestment from Myanmar, Azerbaijan, 
and Chad signifies the ongoing effort 
to reshape our portfolio and redeploy 
capital to our identified areas of 
growth. The direction we are 
undertaking is centred on preserving 
and strengthening our core portfolio 
even as we grow our new energy 
business to remain relevant, resilient 
and sustainable given a lower carbon 
future.
In laying the foundation for our future 
growth and upholding our 
commitment to our shareholder for 
long-term economic value creation, 
PETRONAS’ priority going forward is to 
deliver energy from our portfolio as 
differentiated products that are safe, 
responsible, cost-optimised and 
emissions abated for the energy 
security and sustainability of Malaysia 
and our customers across the globe.
Nurturing an Ecosystem for 
Collective Progress
In our role as the National Oil 
Company, PETRONAS fully recognises 
the Amanah – the duty of trust- it has 
to fulfil to its stakeholders to be their 
partner in progress. This sacred 
responsibility to maximise the value of 
the nation’s hydrocarbon resources is 
enshrined in the 1974 Act that brought 
us into being and remains our duty for 
shared prosperity and energy security.
In 2021, PETRONAS together with the 
State Governments of Sarawak and 
Sabah have entered into mutually 
beneficial agreements which now 
secure the path to value creation 
opportunities for all parties. On our 
part, PETRONAS will continue to grow 
our heartlands in Sarawak and Sabah 
for shared prosperity, anchored on our 
mutual commitment to develop the 
respective State’s oil and gas industry. 
PETRONAS will deliver this by inviting 
increased participation throughout the 
value chain- in effect, working closer 
together to grow the “value pie”.
While the oil and gas industry has 
long been vulnerable to the boom-
and-bust cycles, the unprecedented 
challenges of the past two years will 
very likely remain significant for a 
good while yet. Therefore, resilience 
will be required to respond to the 
energy market shocks and navigate 
the challenges presented by energy 
transition – which includes nurturing a 
robust and strong Oil & Gas, Services 
and Equipment (OGSE) ecosystem.
In recognition of this, it is important 
to note that the Group’s initiatives to 
elevate the robustness of the OGSE 
sector were initiated as far back as 
1993 with the rollout of the Vendor 
Development Programme. Initiatives 
continue to be introduced and 
implemented to improve the overall 
resilience and maintain the stability of 
the ecosystem at large.
These initiatives have been wide-
ranging: from facilitating financial 
assistance in collaboration with banks 
under the Vendor Financing 
Programme, to becoming the first 
Government Linked Company (GLC) to 
support the JanaNiaga initiative by the 
Ministry of Finance and Exim Bank to 
assist Small and Medium Enterprises 
(SMEs) under the Malaysia economic 
recovery plan.
We have also been continuously 
investing in upskilling OGSE capabilities 
under the PETRONAS Vendor 
Development Programme (VDP) since 
its inception. To this end, the VDPx 
programme launched in 2018 
empowered VDP anchors to replicate 
the programme to develop their very 
own vendor ecosystem.
PETRONAS recognises its role as a 
catalyst for the Malaysian OGSE sector, 
and it remains committed in working 
together with our partners. This 
collaboration will become even more 
important, even as the oil and gas 
industry collectively accelerate its 
efforts to decarbonise operations as 
part of a far-reaching energy 
transition. Such a transition must be 
executed responsibly and sustainably, 
where we would need to deploy 
lower-carbon technologies strategically 
and systematically.
So, this next statement cannot be 
reiterated enough times, it has 
become absolutely critical for our 
OGSE players to pursue innovation, so 
they can ultimately be as competitive 
as global players in the course of 
doing business. This would ensure the 
projects we pursue and the production 
we aspire can remain technically and 
economically feasible, despite the 
inevitable cyclical swings in the energy 
market.
Overall, PETRONAS will continue to 
nurture a robust OGSE ecosystem to 
strengthen our resilience in responding 
to these challenges and effectively 
contribute to Malaysia’s economic 
growth. In this opportunity, I would 
like to thank our valued stakeholders 
– Federal and State Governments, 
agencies and authorities, and OGSE 
partners for their many efforts and 
support for PETRONAS to continue 
growing the value pie of the nation’s 
hydrocarbon resources for the benefit 
of the nation and its people.
Accelerating Our NZCE 2050 
Aspiration
As we navigate the increasingly 
challenging operating landscape, the 
call for greater action to manage the 
energy transition has never been 
stronger. As I write to you today, we 
now live in a time described by many 
as a “post-Glasgow” era. It has 
become abundantly clear to the world 
at large – after COP26 was convened 
in this Scottish city in 2021 – that a 
more intense focus on decarbonisation 
efforts must be accelerated, not later, 
but right now.
Governments are transitioning towards 
a low-carbon future where 
approximately 90 per cent of the 
world has committed to net zero 
targets. Malaysia is no exception: it 
too has pledged to reduce its carbon 
intensity by 45 per cent by 2030 and 
aims to deliver net zero by 2050, with 
its path to action outlined in the 
Twelfth Malaysia Plan.
On this front, PETRONAS had the 
privilege and opportunity to 
collaborate with the Economic 
Planning Unit (EPU) to develop clear 
targets and policies for the National 
Energy Policy and the Natural Gas 
Roadmap which aims to provide the 
optimal balance of energy equity, 
security and sustainability for Malaysia.
59
Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS)
Letter from the President and Group Chief Executive Officer


PETRONAS will indeed support these 
national ambitions and strengthen our 
own targets and governance towards 
progressing our NZCE 2050 aspiration. 
Our recent progress on this front 
includes the endorsement of the 
World Bank Zero Flaring Commitment 
and the successful organisation of the 
ASEAN Methane Roundtable. We are 
also leveraging on our partnership 
since February 2020 with the World 
Business Council on Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD) towards 
adopting the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to 
ensure our continued ability to access 
financial markets.
Furthermore, through increased 
technological partnerships with industry 
players, PETRONAS is undertaking 
efforts to unlock Malaysia’s potential as 
a regional carbon capture and storage 
solutions (CCS) hub. PETRONAS is also 
exploring opportunities in lower-carbon 
solutions through collaborations in 
carbon dioxide (CO₂) storage 
technologies, deployment of DC Fast 
EV chargers at Mesra stations across 
Malaysia, and undertaking a joint 
feasibility study in carbon-neutral 
methane.
Through rigorous efforts in 
decarbonising our operations, I am 
pleased to share that we are on track 
with total reduced GHG emissions in 
Malaysia by 5.4 per cent in 2021 to 
43.8 million tCO₂e, below our 2024 
mid-term target which is to cap GHG 
emissions to 49.5 million tCO₂e in 
Malaysian operations. While our 
methane emissions intensity has also 
recorded a steady downward trend, 
more can be done and accordingly our 
efforts will be intensified on this front.
Seizing Opportunities for Future 
Growth
Looking ahead to 2022, while there is 
a certain degree of recovery and 
growth expected with the reopening 
of economies, immense uncertainties 
still prevail. Therefore, PETRONAS will 
continue exercising prudent financial 
management given our cautious outlook 
amid an ultra-volatile geopolitical 
environment and an accelerating energy 
transition. At the same time, it is also 
imperative for the Group to seize the 
attractive opportunities which will 
surface as the energy transition unfolds.
In 2022, PETRONAS will be 
undertaking its next phase of growth 
by elevating the progress that has 
been achieved under the Gas + New 
Energy (G+NE) business. PETRONAS is 
determined to grow the new energy 
business profitably at scale and with 
pace by establishing a new, 
independent entity focused fully on 
cleaner energy solutions. This entity 
will be charged to capture 
opportunities at pace in the energy 
transition alongside our core portfolio 
by providing customers with lower-
carbon solutions in three core 
offerings – Renewables, Hydrogen and 
Green Mobility. Our ambition is for the 
entity to eventually be 
uncompromisingly green, addressing 
our customers’ growing need for 
cleaner energy solutions and 
supporting the shared global aspiration 
for a lower carbon future.
PETRONAS will also be accelerating 
decarbonisation efforts across its own 
entire integrated value chain by 
managing a carbon storage portfolio 
for emissions produced by its 
operations and establishing a regional 
storage hub for carbon emissions as a 
new revenue generator.
We are positioning ourselves to 
accelerate growth in these fast-
developing spaces with the new entity 
and the Carbon Management Unit. 
The Group is confident that with the 
strength and reliability of its core 
portfolio combined with our new suite 
of offerings, PETRONAS will evolve to 
present itself to its customers as an 
‘energy superstore’ that powers 
businesses and fuels progress in a just 
and sustainable manner.
I look forward to sharing more 
exciting updates with you in due 
course.
Upholding the Trust Anchored 
on Shared Values
As PETRONAS positions itself for the 
future, it remains our sacred duty to 
manage and maximise the nation’s 
hydrocarbon resources for the benefit 
of all, and we will continue to do so 
with integrity and professionalism.
PETRONAS has in place a fully 
functioning Corporate Governance 
framework. Our constituted 
organisational structure continues to see 
an Internal Audit function that reports 
directly to the independent directors on 
our Board Audit Committee.
Our employees are guided by the 
PETRONAS Code of Business Ethics 
(CoBE) and the Anti Bribery and 
Corruption Policy & Guidelines Manual 
in how they should ethically carry out 
his or her duties. PETRONAS also 
continues to leverage its collaboration 
with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption 
Commission (MACC) which was 
initiated since 2012. Following the 
formation of an Integrity Unit in 
PETRONAS, we have a fully 
functioning Whistleblowing Committee 
chaired by a Chief Integrity Officer 
who independently reports to the 
PETRONAS Board.
With collaboration as the cornerstone 
of all our endeavours, PETRONAS 
takes accountability of the resources 
we have been entrusted with. The 
organisation’s actions are deeply 
embedded with the Shared Values of 
Integrity, Professionalism, Cohesiveness 
and Loyalty, living up to our purpose 
as a trusted partner for progress for 
our stakeholders.
Even as it discharges its duty of trust 
in managing the nation’s valuable 
resources, PETRONAS fully recognises 
that managing such finite resource 
cannot be an infinite venture. For the

Acknowledgements
The stage is well and truly set for 
PETRONAS to step up even more 
meaningfully in pursuing its purpose 
and delivering profitable growth, 
responsibly and sustainably. To this 
end, we would be the first to 
recognise that the respectable 
performance we registered in 2021 
was due to the contribution and 
efforts of many parties whom we now 
wish to acknowledge.
Permit me to firstly place on record 
my appreciation to members of the 
PETRONAS Board of Directors, for 
their wise counsel and vigilant 
stewardship that saw us navigate the 
challenging period to emerge a 
stronger and more resilient 
organisation.
Given this opportunity, please allow 
me to extend my personal and 
heartfelt appreciation to Tan Sri 
Ahmad Nizam Salleh, who will always 
be remembered as an upright and 
thoughtful leader who has made 
innumerable contributions - not only 
throughout his three-year tenure as 
Chairman, but over his many decades 
of service to the PETRONAS Group of 
Companies.
On 1 August 2021, it was the distinct 
privilege of PETRONAS to welcome 
Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Mohd Bakke Salleh 
as its new Chairman. Given Tan Sri 
Dato’ Seri Mohd Bakke’s reputation for 
integrity, astute insights and 
commercial acumen, I am assured his 
vast experience will ensure that the 
organisation remains a trusted partner 
for progress.
In 2021, we bid farewell to two 
members of the PETRONAS Executive 
Leadership team – Encik Maliki Kamal 
Mohd Yassin, who retired as Senior 
Vice President and Group General 
Counsel and Haji Samsudin Miskon, 
who retired as Senior Vice President of 
Project Delivery and Technology 
(PD&T). We are immensely grateful for 
their dedicated service to the 
organisation and unwavering support 
to see us through the many 
challenges faced by the industry. They 
have now been ably succeeded by 
Encik Razman Hashim and Haji Bacho 
Pilong respectively.
In early 2022, we saw the departure 
of Datuk Md Arif Mahmood, Executive 
Vice President and CEO of PETRONAS 
Downstream Business, after 37 
illustrious years with the company. A 
friend and mentor to many, he 
became known as a leader who 
pushes boundaries, as demonstrated in 
his pivotal role in our Pengerang 
Integrated Complex (PIC). In his stead, 
we welcome Datuk Sazali Hamzah, 
who previously served as Vice 
President and CEO for PETRONAS 
Chemicals Group Bhd (PCG).
No acknowledgment would be 
complete without thanking our 
employees, stakeholders and industry 
partners both at home and wherever 
we operate for their unwavering 
contribution, support and trust in 
PETRONAS.
The PETRONAS family looks forward 
to navigating this next phase of 
growth with you as we fulfil our 
purpose and become your preferred 
progressive energy and solutions 
partner.

Chief Financial Officer
PETRONAS Group delivered a strong set of financial and operational results for the year as the company continued to 
accelerate its recovery efforts. Improvements in global energy prices have been fundamental this year, with the reopening 
of economies globally. Despite the rising trend in energy prices, the situation remained volatile and uncertain. The global 
landscape faces ongoing COVID-19 challenges, geopolitical factors and supply chain disruptions, which coincided with 
the acceleration of the energy transition. Therefore, the Group responded to the favourable market conditions with a 
disciplined approach. Despite the prevailing high oil price towards the end of the year, we exercised fiscal discipline to 
ensure long term sustainability and growth. As such, we remain prudent and maintain our long-term price outlook within 
the range of USD50-60/bbl. At the same time, the Group continued to strengthen the core business through commercial 
and operational excellence, while accelerating its efforts to pursue growth in non-traditional businesses. The focused 
execution of strategies coupled with agile and resilient operations, has been key to the Group’s commendable 
performance in 2021.

Integrated Report 2021


Our Financial Year in Review
PETRONAS achieved a Profit After Tax (PAT) of RM48.6 
billion for 2021, which is a major turnaround from the Loss 
After Tax (LAT) of RM21.0 billion the previous year. PAT for 
the year also exceeded the RM40.5 billion recorded in 
FY2019, before the industry-wide disruptions caused by 
COVID-19. The substantial rise in profit was driven by a 
rebound in revenue and the effectiveness of cost discipline 
measures that PETRONAS continued to practice.
The Group saw a substantial rise in revenue to RM248.0 
billion, a 39 per cent increase from the RM178.7 billion 
recorded in 2020, also exceeding the RM240.3 billion 
recorded in 2019. The significant increase in revenue was 
contributed by rising energy prices, following a rebound in 
demand for gas, petroleum products and Liquefied Natural 
Gas (LNG), amongst other market influences.
PETRONAS also saw stronger performance across other 
key financial metrics. In line with the higher revenue and 
effective cost management, Earnings Before Interest, Tax, 
Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) rose to RM100.5 
billion, an 82 per cent increase from the previous year’s 
RM55.3 billion.
Segmental Performance
PETRONAS Group recorded improved performance across 
all three business segments in 2021. While the volatile 
crude oil prices in 2021 had varying impacts across 
different business segments, the Group as a whole 
benefitted from the integrated business that encompasses 
the total oil and gas value chain.
Upstream business recorded revenue growth of 48 per 
cent to RM104.4 billion by capitalising on rising energy 
prices and higher gas demand from Malaysia and 
international operations. Upstream’s PAT stands at RM34.5 
billion for the year.
Gas + New Energy (G+NE) business recorded a 38 per 
cent increase in revenue, to RM85.8 billion. G+NE’s overall 
performance was positively impacted by the increase in 
energy prices, maximising gas and LNG sales to fulfil the 
market supply-demand gap. G+NE also achieved growth 
by leveraging the increasing demand for new energy 
products.
Downstream revenue rose by 46 per cent to RM124.5 
billion. The business saw a rise in the cost of inputs as 
energy and feedstock prices were higher than normal in 
2021. Stronger financial results for the year can be 
attributed to an increased focus on cost discipline and 
securing more favourable commercial deals by being more 
customer-centric.
The Group saw a 
substantial rise in revenue 
to RM248.0 billion, a  
39 per cent increase from 
the RM178.7 billion 
recorded in 2020, and 
exceeds the RM240.3 
billion recorded in 2019.

Strong Financial Position
The Group’s Cash Flows from 
Operations (CFFO) remained robust at 
RM78.6 billion, in line with higher cash 
operating profits. CFFO margin also 
increased to 32 per cent in 2021, up 
from 23 per cent in 2020. Stronger 
cash flow during the year resulted in a 
29 per cent rise in the Group’s net 
cash position to RM67.2 billion for 
2021. The current solid cash position 
puts PETRONAS in the top quartile 
among its peer group of international 
oil majors.
Total assets stood at RM635.0 billion 
as of 31 December 2021, marking an 
11 per cent rise from RM574.1 billion 
in the preceding year. Growth in 
assets during the year was attributable 
to higher cash and fund investments, 
as well as higher receivables, in line 
with higher benchmark prices.
Cash flows from operating activities 
grew by RM37.9 billion or 93 per cent 
from 2020, in line with higher cash 
from operations. Additionally, gearing 
ratio increased to 23.1 per cent from 
21.3 per cent in 2020, which is 
primarily due to the issuance of notes 
and bonds.
Prudent Financial Management
Despite the more favourable operating 
environment, PETRONAS continued to 
maintain stringent financial discipline 
during the year. The Group worked to 
achieve the right balance between 
financial prudence and strategic 
investments to catalyse future growth.
During the year, PETRONAS continued 
to invest in growth projects. However, 
many projects were affected by the 
prolonged movement restriction order, 
coupled with supply chain interruptions. 
Both domestic and international 
projects experienced delays and 
deferments, resulting in a nine  per cent 
decrease in capital expenditure (CAPEX) 
to RM30.5 billion.
CAPEX continues to be divided almost 
equally between Malaysia and 
international projects. A total of 
RM15.0 billion was directed to 
domestic projects, principally in the 
Upstream segment, where the focus 
remained on the development of new 
fields. International expenditure 
continues to be primarily directed to 
the monetisation of gas in Canada and 
the shipping business in China and the 
Americas.

Both bond issuances were 
well received by investors in 
the international debt capital 
market, drawing high 
demand, resulting in the 
lowest coupon and tightest 
issue spreads in PETRONAS’ 
30-year issuance history.
Additionally, the Group invested in 
innovative technologies that aim to 
improve the efficiency and costs of 
operations. For instance, Upstream 
adopted remote operations applications 
at eight drilling sites for improved cost 
savings.
The majority of the CAPEX for 2021 
was directed to maintaining existing 
cash generators. However, significant 
investments were channelled towards 
future growth drivers, which includes 
non-traditional businesses such as 
solar and speciality chemicals.
Debt Capital Market
PETRONAS continuously assesses its 
funding requirements and evaluates 
financing strategies in order to 
optimise the cost of funding and 
capital. During the year, PETRONAS 
issued two bonds as part of the 
Global Medium-Term Notes 
programme. The first bond, worth 
USD600 million, was issued by 
PETRONAS Energy Canada Ltd (PECL) 
to fund its continued development and 
production activities in Canada. The 
second bond was issued by 
PETRONAS Capital Limited (PCL), 
amounting to USD3 billion, to 
refinance PETRONAS’ maturing debts 
in 2022. Both issuances were well 
received by investors in the 
international debt capital market, 
drawing high demand, resulting in the 
lowest coupon and tightest issue 
spreads in PETRONAS’ 30-year 
issuance history. This is a testimony to 
the strength of its credit and investors’ 
confidence in the Group’s financial 
future. These issuances have further 
strengthened PETRONAS’ balance 
sheet and extended its debt maturity 
profile.

In 2021, close to 
RM1.0 billion of 
CAPEX was spent 
on stepping out 
beyond our core 
business, mainly 
on renewables.
Credit Rating
PETRONAS’ credit ratings remain 
strong, with a rating of A2, A- and 
BBB+ from Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s 
(S&P) and Fitch, respectively. The 
standalone credit profile is four 
notches above PETRONAS’ credit 
ratings, as assessed by S&P and Fitch. 
These ratings bear testimony to 
PETRONAS’ robust financial strength 
and solid business fundamentals, 
which bolster our ability to adapt and 
remain resilient amidst the new normal 
for the industry and market.
Contributions to Governments
PETRONAS’ contribution to the Federal 
Government of Malaysia and state 
governments amounted to RM48.2 
billion for the year ended 
31  December 2021. This includes 
dividends, taxes and cash payments.  
In addition, PETRONAS paid RM100 
million to the National Trust Fund 
(NTF) in 2021.
To this end, PETRONAS’ cumulative 
contributions to the Federal 
Government of Malaysia, state 
governments and NTF amounted to 
RM1.3 trillion.
Delivering on Our Purpose 
Beyond Profit
The year witnessed evolving 
stakeholder expectations and global 
pressure on businesses to identify and 
manage their environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) impacts. Within 
the energy industry, oil and gas 
producers are expected to devise 
strategies to respond to the energy 
transition as well as any direct 
implications on their business and 
operations. Against this backdrop, one 
of the biggest change for oil and gas 
(O&G) companies would be to redirect 
sizeable capital or investment towards 
other sustainable sources of energy 
and low carbon solutions such as 
carbon capture and storage (CCS) 
technologies.
In response to this changing 
landscape, PETRONAS has allocated 
approximately 20 per cent of total 
CAPEX over the next five years for 
green investments in pursuit of 
meeting the net zero carbon emissions 
by 2050 (NZCE 2050) aspiration. In

core business, mainly on renewables. In  2020, PETRONAS Group embarked on 
its first decarbonisation project for high carbon dioxide (CO₂) gas field at the 
Kasawari gas field in the waters off Sarawak.
The project will deploy CO₂ reinjection technology into a storage reservoir, 
potentially preventing up to 90 per cent of emissions, or 3.7 million tonnes of 
carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO₂e), from being released into the atmosphere. 
This will entail significant initial investment. Under the annual Plan and Budget 
FY2022-2026, various investments shall be explored including carbon offsets 
and carbon technologies towards delivering NZCE 2050.
Moving Forward
The outlook for the year ahead remains uncertain. Volatility in oil prices will 
continue to pose new challenges in the operating environment. The strong 
rebound in energy prices since the beginning of 2021 has been supportive of 
PETRONAS Group’s performance. Notwithstanding, the current state of higher 
prices could well be short-lived, given the uncertainties of geopolitical climate, 
along with other shocks that could hit the energy market. This is further 
aggravated by significant pressure arising from energy transition, which 
necessitates us to intensify efforts to decarbonise, and scale up investments in 
the renewables space. Accordingly, the business remains cautious and continues 
to focus on operational efficiencies, commercial excellence and prudent 
financial management.
The year 2022 will be critical to revive 
delayed or deferred projects mainly 
from the disruptions caused by 
COVID-19. An increase in capital 
expenditure from project launches and 
deals is expected, coupled with a 
steep rise in renewables and low 
carbon technology and solutions 
spending in the near to medium-term. 
PETRONAS is well-positioned to 
leverage this changing landscape, with 
its affordability matrix, where necessary 
investments have been earmarked 
towards future growth strategies and 
sustainability goals while exercising 
strict capital discipline.
As it enters a new year, PETRONAS 
will remain committed to its strategic 
planning process, driven by the energy 
transition and NZCE 2050 aspiration. 
The Group will achieve its ESG 
commitments and growth through risk 
assessments, cost controls, responsible 
governance and above all, strong 
fundamentals for sustainable value 
creation.

At PETRONAS, we are embracing these rising 
expectations for sustainable business practices. 
Sustainability to us goes hand-in-hand with 
our long-term strategic objectives. By taking a 
proactive stance we protect our business from 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
risks and improve our prospects to achieve 
long-term growth while supporting the needs 
of our stakeholders. Therefore, we view the 
rapid changes as a defining opportunity to 
create positive change benefitting more 
segments of the population – transforming 
the energy system to create economic growth, 
revitalising society and leaving behind a better 
planet for future generations.
The Sustainability Landscape
At the 2021 United Nations’ Climate Change 
Conference (COP26) held in Glasgow, United 
Kingdom, I sensed new levels of commitment 
to climate action. People from a range of 
groups, including the private sector, 
governments, investors, NGOs and activists, 
came together to try and solve the global 
climate crisis. The conference was framed by 
the findings of the 6th Assessment Report by 
the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate 
Change (IPCC), which warns that without 
drastic and immediate action to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, the world is 
headed towards a global temperature increase 
significantly above 1.5°C that is expected to 
result in irreversible consequences.
Dear Stakeholders,
I am pleased to join PETRONAS as its first Vice 
President and Chief Sustainability Officer during an 
exciting albeit trying time. The world is at a pivotal 
moment. The events of recent years have 
highlighted the importance of addressing societal 
and environmental challenges. From the socio-
economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to 
rising climate-related disasters, the need to build a 
more resilient and sustainable future is clearer than 
ever. People across society are looking at 
businesses to help drive this sustainability agenda, 
with increasing pressure from customers, investors, 
regulators and other stakeholders. For the energy 
sector, this means undergoing a radical shift 
towards greener, low-carbon solutions capable of 
meeting long-term energy demands. This energy 
transition is necessary to limit the worst effects of 
climate change and stimulate sustainable and 
inclusive economic development.

COP26 is considered a significant 
turning point in collective climate 
action, as 90 per cent of global Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) has now 
committed to achieving net zero 
carbon emissions. The pledges made 
alongside the COP26 event support the 
global shift to more sustainable 
solutions, with many international 
leaders taking a stance on the energy 
transition. For instance, over 100 
countries signed the Global Methane 
Pledge, limiting methane emissions by 
30 per cent by 2030, compared to 
2020 levels. Several nations have also 
committed to phasing out the use of 
coal, including Malaysia. In support of 
the energy transition, the Glasgow 
Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), 
a global coalition of leading financial 
institutions pledged over USD130 
trillion of private capital to accelerate 
decarbonisation with a specific 
emphasis on developing countries.
Over the year, nature has become a 
key aspect in climate-related policy 
discussions. The alarming loss of 
biodiversity is now recognised as a 
critical factor in securing a stable 
climate and well-being for the world’s 
population. Also here we can expect 
greater demands on corporate action. 
The social aspect of sustainability has also  
gained much needed attention recently. The 
disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on 
vulnerable communities highlighted severe 
inequalities faced by society, resulting in increased 
calls for action. Companies are scrutinised for their 
diversity and inclusion efforts, human and labour 
rights practices, and stance on other societal issues.
Malaysia is classified as one of the 
most biodiverse-rich countries in the 
world. Going forward, we will seek to 
better understand our impact on nature 
and take more assertive action in 
promoting nature conservation.

It is important to note that many

conscious that the energy transition 
needs to be just and equitable, 
especially in Asia, where major 
economic gaps exist between and 
within countries. This requires 
unprecedented collaboration between 
policymakers, industry, investors, 
community groups and society at large 
in driving an energy transition that 
creates better outlooks for the growing

building on the strength and ambition of 
the nation.
Institutionalising Sustainability
The inherent link between climate 
change, nature loss, persistent 
inequality, and business resilience and 
performance is now better understood. 
The debate has moved on from the 
‘why’ to the ‘how’ we should be 
addressing these systemic sustainability 
challenges. We are seeing a rapid scale 
up in emissions-related regulation, ESG 
standards and frameworks that in turn 
drive investor confidence in low carbon 
technology and solutions.
PETRONAS recognises sustainability as 
a critical element in how we develop 
our business. We are responding to the 
external context by developing robust 
data collection and analysis as a basis 
for future target setting, firming up 
governance, capacity and capability 
around sustainability management. We 
are exploring better integration of ESG 
factors into PETRONAS’ Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) process. Similarly, 
we conduct an annual materiality 
assessment to determine key ESG 
matters that impact our sustainable 
value creation, which is considered 
during risk assessments and strategic 
decision making. All risks identified in 
our corporate risk profile are 
deliberated by the Board through the 
Board Risk Committee. In 2021, this 
included deliberation on ESG risks 
associated with climate change, health 
and safety, and human rights.
The establishment of my new role,

Towards a Low Carbon Future
We acknowledge the scientific consensus on climate 
change, and recognise the express need to cut our 
emissions in contribution towards global climate goals. In 
2020, we announced our aspiration to reach net zero 
carbon emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050) – the first oil and 
gas company in Southeast Asia to do so. Our aspiration 
underscores our ambition to meet higher sustainability 
goals for the longer term that address stakeholder 
concerns and support the ambitions of the Paris 
Agreement.
In 2021, we recorded a total of 45.2 million tonnes of 
carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO₂e) emissions across our 
global operations, a reduction of 6.4 per cent from 2020. 
In Malaysia, our greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 
5.4 per cent to 43.8 MtCO₂e from 46.3 MtCO₂e, in 2020 
mainly contributed by venting and flaring reduction 
projects in Upstream operations.
We understand that our NZCE 2050 aspiration will require 
a major shift in how we develop our business going 
forward. We are committed to expedite our emissions 
reduction, including a specific focus on methane emissions. 
To this end, PETRONAS has endorsed the World Bank’s 
Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 Initiative, which aims to end 
routine flaring of associated gas from our oil production. 
We are also signatory to the international Methane Guiding 
Principles initiative that promotes collaboration between 
stakeholders to expedite emissions abatement.
The shift to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources 
present a major growth opportunity for our business. We 
are already on this journey. In 2021, we had close to 1  GW 
of solar capacity in operation and under development. We 
have also formalised our collaborations with customers, 
technology and industry partners to develop carbon 
capture and storage (CCS) technology as a viable 
abatement option for our own operations and other high 
emitting industries, studying the feasibility of producing 
carbon neutral methane and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), 
to mention a few areas with promising growth prospects.
Our NZCE 2050 aspiration provides the necessary impetus 
for us to pursue more climate-friendly solutions and 
opportunities in the broader energy space that will create 
sustainable new values for the organisation.
To openly inform and engage our stakeholders in how 
climate change may affect our business both from 
downside risk and opportunity angles, PETRONAS will 
adopt the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), with a target to 
commence our disclosures in 2023.
Partners of Society
As we increase our efforts in protecting the planet, we 
remain steadfast in our commitment to providing positive 
social impact.
Our commitment to safeguarding people intensified with 
the COVID-19 pandemic. We swiftly introduced COVID-19 
platforms and programmes with the aim to keep our 
people safe with minimal disruptions to our operations –  
a true testament to the agility of our organisation. Further 
details about our robust response to the pandemic is 
outlined on page 193 of this report.
Additionally, through Yayasan PETRONAS, the Corporate 
Social Responsibility arm of PETRONAS, we provided flood 
relief aid to hard-hit communities, delivering necessary 
supplies to prevent, control and treat impacted 
communities located across our assets. We mobilised our 
employee volunteers to offer on-the-ground assistance to 
local communities with an additional contribution of 
RM25.0 million towards relief and assistance for the 
victims.
The COVID-19 pandemic has forcefully exposed and 
exacerbated inequalities across the world. As partners of 
society, we recognise the need to accelerate our efforts in 
providing equal access to resources and opportunities, as 
well as the importance of putting human rights at the 
centre of our operations. We are continuously looking to 
improve and systemise our human rights assessments in 
the company and throughout the value chain.
Strengthening Performance through Collaboration
As a national oil and gas company with an extensive 
international reach, we play a strong role in supporting 
sustainable development, particularly in driving a low-
carbon energy future for Malaysia. The energy transition 
demands a whole transformation of society. To better 
prepare the organisation and our value chain, we need to 
bring our partners along the path to a low carbon 
economy, while ensuring our employees, partners and 
stakeholders are all upskilled on sustainability. We firmly 
believe that real positive change can only occur through 
collective action and a more assertive approach.
Key Messages
72
Integrated Report 2021
Letter from the Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer


In 2020, we became a member of the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), joining over 
200 other forward-thinking multinational companies. 
Through WBCSD, we can shape and gain insights and 
collaboratively develop solutions to address pressing 
sustainability challenges. We can leverage WBCSD’s wide 
networking platform across a variety of sectors.
To remain a WBCSD member, we need to adhere to 
stringent criteria, such as setting ambitious science-
informed environmental goals, committing to becoming 
net zero by 2050, declaring support for the United Nations 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, 
supporting inclusion, equality and diversity, and operating 
at the highest level of transparency through sustainability 
disclosures.
We are also part of the CEO Action Network (CAN), 
Malaysia’s first sustainability-focused coalition of leading 
CEOs and senior decision-makers. CAN focuses on 
changing the nation’s market landscape through 
sustainability advocacy, capacity building, action and 
performance. PETRONAS President and Group Chief 
Executive Officer, as CAN chairperson of the steering 
committee, announced collective ESG commitments for 
2023. These commitments will be pivotal to enabling 
Malaysia’s transition to a net zero carbon future, as well as 
accomplishing the aspirations of Malaysia’s Shared 
Prosperity Vision 2030.
We are also working closely with the Malaysian 
government to support policy development and further 
drive the nation’s sustainability efforts. For example, we are 
engaging directly with the government in the development 
of voluntary carbon markets for nature-based carbon 
solutions. This will be an important tool in not only 
preserving biodiversity and the ecosystem, but also 
supporting a net zero carbon economy.
What the Future Holds
In the years ahead, the need for green and sustainable 
practices will only grow. For PETRONAS, we are 
determined to seize new opportunities for sustainable, 
profitable growth as we uphold our responsibility as 
Malaysia’s national oil and gas company and lay the 
foundation for our future growth. In 2022, we will be 
stepping up even more meaningfully in pursuing our 
purpose to become a progressive energy and solutions 
partner enriching lives for a sustainable future. This 
includes releasing more details about our pathway towards 
NZCE 2050 and how this will lay the foundation for other 
sustainability priorities.

Operating Landscape 
Our ability to realise our value creation 
abilities hinges on the global 
macroeconomic landscape and its impact 
on the global oil and gas industry. The 
varying factors that affect the 
macroenvironment are closely analysed in 
relation to our business and operations, 
allowing us to identify potential trends 
and opportunities.
Stakeholder Expectations 
As we transition to expand our portfolio 
to include cleaner energy solutions, we 
are aware of the importance of managing 
the changing needs of our stakeholders. 
We proactively engage in meaningful 
dialogues, collaborations and 
engagements on various platforms to 
position ourselves as a credible, 
trustworthy partner.
At PETRONAS, we adopt an integrated approach to deliver long-term sustainable value to our 
stakeholders. We do this to gain a holistic view of our activities, examining the interaction between the 
environment, the evolving expectations of our stakeholders and our overall operations to achieve our 
business aspirations. This ensures that our business remains strong, resilient and sustainable, thus enabling 
us to meet the energy needs of current and future generations.

Our Integrated Approach to Value Creation


Reinforcing Good Governance
We see corporate governance as a critical tool in our value creation story. For us, it means going beyond 
compliance in protecting the best interest of all stakeholders. We uphold the highest levels of integrity, 
governance and ethical business practices, anchored by a strong culture of transparency and accountability. This 
safeguards our business and protects the best interest of all our stakeholders.
Our ultimate goal is to 
create sustainable value 
for all our stakeholders. 
Through our integrated 
approach, we ensure all 
elements are taken into 
consideration to allow us 
to deliver value, now and 
for the future.
Our Key Capitals
Creating Meaningful
Value for All
The effective execution of our strategy is measured based on our ability to 
reasonably and intelligently utilise the following six types of resources:
See pages 80-81 for a full disclosure of how the 
capitals are fully utilised in our Value Creation Model
See page 80
Human Capital:

business operations.
Social and Relationship Capital:
The network of relationships between our business and 
stakeholders
Natural Capital:
The natural resources such as water, fuel, and materials used 
across our operations.
Financial Capital:
The pool of funds obtained through financing or generated 
by our business.
Manufactured Capital:
The physical assets and infrastructure required to ensure our 
business operates.
Intellectual Capital:
The intellectual capabilities and intangibles associated with 
our brand, technical expertise and experience.

Our Integrated Approach to Value Creation


Our value creation story relies on a range of resources broadly categorised into Financial, 
Manufactured, Intellectual, Human, Social and Relationship, and Natural Capitals. The efficient and 
intelligent utilisation of these capitals is key to achieving our operational, commercial and growth 
aspirations.
Guided by strong financial metrics 
and a prudent financial 
management track record, we have 
built a pool of funds to finance 
operations and deliver business 
growth. By upholding disciplined 
Financial Capital spending, we are 
able to balance stakeholder value 
with business growth.
Financial Capital
We possess an extensive range of 
highly reliable and efficient assets, 
such as our offshore platforms, 
floating facilities, processing plants, 
innovative equipment, world-class 
office buildings and many more. 
Our Manufactured Capital allows us 
to meet the changing market and 
energy demands, current and future.
Manufactured Capital
Our operations are backed by 
proprietary technologies, knowledge, 
systems procedures and protocols 
that drive value creation and deliver 
sustained growth. This is our 
differentiating factor and will enable 
us to meet our long-term strategic 
objectives.

Our Key Capitals


The future of our organisation 
depends on the skills, knowledge 
and capabilities of our people. We 
invest in providing a wholesome 
talent experience to nurture a 
high-performing, innovative culture 
that is able to navigate a volatile 
industry for long-term growth. 
Human Capital
We develop long-lasting, mutually-
beneficial relationships with our 
stakeholders to help business 
growth and improve the well-being 
of the communities. Doing so 
enables us to build stakeholder trust 
and support in our ability to deliver 
value far into the future.
Social and  
Relationship Capital
Our business model leverages 
natural resources to ensure the 
security of energy supply as well as 
the development of quality products 
and services for customers. 
Respecting the delicate balance 
between the natural environment 
and human economy, we advocate 
responsible utilisation of natural 
resources to create sustainable 
value for all stakeholders.
Natural Capital
Although each capital is distinct from one another, they are interrelated. Therefore, our strategy 
development and execution involve contemplating the dynamics between the six capitals to 
optimise stakeholder value over the short, medium and long term.

How We Sustain Value: 
Performance by 
Capitals
The business growth achieved over 
the long-term is dependent on our 
ability to draw value from our six 
capitals, which are categorised as 
Financial, Manufactured, Intellectual, 
Human, Social and Relationship, and 
Natural Capitals. As these capitals are 
largely based on our resources and 
relationships that are essential to our 
business, they provide stakeholders 
with greater clarity on how we 
maximise positive outcomes, minimise 
trade-offs and, at the same time, 
balance our environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) scorecard. We 
leverage these capitals in a responsible 
manner to deliver our strategy for 
long-term sustainable growth and, 
most importantly, create added value 
for our stakeholders.
Our strong financial base through income and 
earnings generated by our business, is necessary 
to fund our long-term objectives.

• We need to balance the utilisation of Financial Capital 
between investments in our core business, 
predominantly Manufactured Capital, and growth.
• Financial Capital is utilised to fund capital investments 
and operating expenditures to increase other capitals 
to achieve long-term growth and sustainable 
performance.
• Although this may reduce our short-term Financial 
Capital, we can replenish this and create greater 
financial value in the long run through disciplined and 
effective investment decisions.
• Strengthen liquidity and risk management to protect 
cash flow.
• Maintain prudent and disciplined financial 
management system.

• As an asset-heavy organisation, the growth of our 
company depends on growth in our Manufactured 
Capital.
• Financial Capital needs to be used to expand our 
infrastructure, processing plants, equipment, 
renewable technologies, and more so that we can 
continue meeting society’s energy demands, which 
contribute to our Social and Relationship Capital.
• However, we must manage our Manufactured Capital 
in a responsible manner. Health and safety issues will 
negatively affect our Human Capital, while poor 
environmental practices impact our Natural, and Social 
and Relationship Capital (loss of stakeholder trust).
• Our focus on clean energy solutions means expanding 
our Manufactured Capital to include renewable 
infrastructure, which requires a high amount of 
Financial Capital in the near term, but this will 
positively impact all other capitals, particularly Natural, 
Social and Relationship, and Intellectual Capitals.
• Improve asset reliability and integrity to deliver 
business targets.
• Ensure world-class maintenance of assets to deliver 
operational excellence.
• Increase focus on customer-centric and demand-led 
solutions to gain access to broader market and 
achieve business targets.

• To achieve our strategic vision, we need to build 
stakeholder trust and loyalty, which is essentially 
reflected in our Social and Relationship Capital.
• We utilised our Financial Capital in 2021 to protect 
our stakeholders and business from the impact of 
COVID-19. Funds were channelled to help employees 
navigate new work environments, support suppliers’ 
operations during lockdown periods, and provide 
critical assistance to communities in need.
• While this may have impacted Financial Capital, it has 
enhanced our position as a responsible corporate 
citizen among our stakeholders, which indirectly 
serves all our other capitals.
• Strengthen collaboration and relationships with 
industry players.
• Drive multifaceted strategic initiatives with 
government agencies to help shape policies for the 
energy industry.
• Amplify collaborations with the Malaysian 
Government and host governments for humanitarian 
relief efforts such as COVID-19, natural disasters, 
and others.
• Enrich the lives of our communities by continuing 
to provide education opportunities through 
sponsorship, programmes, and infrastructure.
• Advocate the use of natural gas and renewable 
energy to stakeholders to realise our energy 
transition plan.

• A large part of our operations still depend on carbon-
based energy and materials, resulting in waste and 
emissions that could potentially impact Natural 
Capital.
• In achieving our NZCE 2050 aspiration, we need to 
improve our consumption of Natural Capital. This 
requires investments in reduction and mitigation 
initiatives that minimise our environmental footprint.
• Financial Capital is channelled into our Manufactured 
Capital as we invest in resource-efficient infrastructure 
and operations, thus minimising our use of Natural 
Capital.
• We also use Financial Capital to improve our Human 
Capital, in which we train and upskill employees so 
they can accelerate the move towards a low-carbon 
economy, which improves Natural Capital in the long 
term.
• Through resource efficiency, we can achieve cost 
savings for improved Financial Capital in the long run. 
Furthermore, by taking care of our Natural Capital, 
we also gain stakeholder trust (Social and Relationship 
Capital).
• Continue to reduce carbon footprint by accelerating 
lower carbon solutions, leveraging technology-driven 
operations. 
• Enhance operational efficiency and achieve zero 
continuous hydrocarbon venting and flaring to 
reduce GHG emissions. 
• Pursue new plastics economy and waste reduction 
potential to address global waste issue and 
Malaysia’s sustainability agenda. 
• Enhance our research and development activities in 
carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to 
effectively manage high carbon dioxide (CO₂) field 
development.

The year 2021 has been particularly difficult for many Malaysians. Not only were there resurgence of new COVID-19 
variants and economic slowdown, but but also severe floods that affected several states in Malaysia at the end of 
the year. It was a challenging year for everyone across various stakeholder groups who faced loss of lives and 
livelihoods, leaving far-reaching economic consequences.
Despite the challenges, we rallied our workforce together. We stood united to reach out and help those in need, 
through on-the-ground support, digital solutions, and monetary contributions. To this end, we prioritised the health 
and safety of our workforce and our communities through rapid, coordinated and effective response. Leveraging on 
our workforce’s broad range of competencies, we partnered with governments and forged powerful alliances to 
drive economic recovery, assisting our vendors through a difficult period significantly marked by the pandemic. 
Meanwhile, for our customers, we introduced products, services and solutions to cater to their needs.
Federal Government/Host Governments 
Governments around the world 
faced continuous pressure to 
revitalise the economy. In 
Malaysia, the government 
accelerated the National 
Vaccination programme and 
gradually opened economic 
sectors. Various stimulus

population, especially those from 
the lower-income group.

The pandemic caused 
disruption to the supply 
chain, both locally and 
globally. The MCOs and 
cautious outlook by 
various economic

In 2021, the world faced pandemic-led challenges as a resurgence of COVID-19 variants weighed heavily on 
businesses and people across the world. Heightened geopolitical tensions followed by uneven global vaccination 
rates also led to uneven economic growth. In Malaysia, the national vaccination programme made inroads in 
stemming the spread of COVID-19 though new variants led to extended lockdowns that slowed economic recovery. 
The global oil and gas sector rebounded strongly in 2021, which saw an increasing number of industry players 
scaling up their commitments towards driving a low-carbon future. 
Throughout 2021, geopolitical flashpoints 
continued to erupt despite the resurgence of new 
COVID-19 variants that kept many regions and 
countries under lockdown measures. In certain 
countries, elections were called as leaders aimed 
to gain fresh mandates to implement policies to 
revive spending and boost their economy to 
counter economic headwinds. Amidst efforts to 
curb the spread of the pandemic and the uneven 
pace in vaccination rates, nations refocused 
efforts on improving domestic recovery. While 
vaccine roll-outs led to improved consumer 
confidence, some countries faced additional 
setbacks from military coups and proxy wars that 
led to further political instability worldwide.
According to the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF), the global economy expanded 5.9 per cent 
in 2021, even with border restrictions and 
intermittent mobility restrictions imposed by 
nations to limit the impact on their healthcare 
systems. These pandemic-led limitations resulted 
in prolonged supply chain disruptions that sent 
prices of commodities and consumer goods 
soaring.

In 2021, a re-opening of economies led to oil demand 
outpacing supply, and the world experienced one of 
its worst energy crisis. Dated Brent rose from USD50/
bbl at the beginning of 2021 to a three-year high of 
USD86/bbl in late October. For 2021, Brent crude 
averaged USD71/bbl, up from USD42/bbl a year earlier. 
Oil inventories in developed markets fell below the 
five-year average since May 2020, as OPEC and its 
allies remained cautious in releasing more oil into the 
market. Supply was disrupted in the US due to a deep 
freeze in Texas and hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.

Gas and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)
Gas and LNG prices surged to record levels in 2021, mainly due to the increase in demand that coincided with 
supply disruptions at LNG plants and reduced gas supply from Russia. Asian spot LNG exceeded USD50/mmBtu, a 
record, in the year due to extreme cold weather in Europe and China at the start of 2021, followed by hotter-
than-usual summer in the middle of the year. These events led to depleted gas storage in Europe, just as Russia 
cut supplies. As a result, spot LNG prices in Asia surged to levels unseen in the past.

The chemicals market rebounded in 2021 from the lowest in more than a decade, led by a surge in demand for 
plastics used in food packaging, personal protection and medical equipment and electronic goods. Ethylene, a 
benchmark for chemicals, averaged USD1,009 per metric tonne last year, up 43 per cent from the average in 
2020. Prices had tumbled in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic led to lockdowns and consumption fell. China, the 
world’s biggest market for most chemicals, drove the recovery as its economy expanded 8.1 per cent in 2021, 
fastest in 10 years, bolstered by the reopening of economies and post-lockdown spending surge which boosted 
demand for chemicals and other goods and materials.

Chemicals
In 2021, Upstream spending rebounded from the lowest level 
in 15 years as the reopening of economies boosted energy 
prices. Upstream capital expenditure (CAPEX) stood at about 
USD400 billion as oil and gas players remained focused on 
sustaining capital discipline to improve cash flows. Following 
the recovery experienced in oil prices, US-led mergers and 
acquisitions reached a two-year high in the second quarter of 
2021. During this period, companies realigned their portfolios. 
Some players disposed petroleum assets while others picked-
up assets to gain economies of scale and cut operational 
costs.
The energy crisis in the previous year led to an increase in 
nationalistic pride as countries looked inwards to ensure 
security of supply. While short-term energy security means 
nations have to be able to meet sudden surges in demand, 
as seen across the world when lockdowns were eased, 
longer-term energy security requires sufficient investments to 
be made today.
Governments made stronger pivots 
towards a low-carbon future to 
reverse the effects of climate change 
in 2021. To date, 90 per cent of 
emitters have made the pledge 
towards net zero carbon emissions.  
A noteworthy event that took place 
during the year in review was the 
establishment of the first-ever climate 
pact that directly referenced coal and 
fossil fuels at the United Nations (UN) 
Climate Change Conference (COP26) 
in Glasgow. This was followed by key 
pledges to reduce methane, phase-
out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies and 
increase commitment towards 
zero-emission vehicles.

2022 Outlook: What the Future Holds
Due to heightened tensions on multiple fronts, 
the world is expected to move into multipolarity. 
The emergence of proxy wars and attacks on key 
infrastructure will further elevate the risk of supply 
disruptions, leading to increased volatility in oil 
prices and operational risks, especially in upstream 
oil and gas. Protests against authoritarian regimes 
are also likely to escalate as the extensive impact 
of social media platforms prevents governments 
from cracking down on dissidents.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects the 
global economy to expand by 4.4 per cent in 
2022, a downgrade from the earlier 4.9 per cent 
projections, citing the spread of the Omicron 
variant that would lead to border closures, travel 
restrictions, supply chain disruptions, elevated 
inflation and the return of tightening monetary 
conditions. High energy prices are also expected 
to contribute to inflation, adding to manufacturers’ 
and businesses’ ongoing supply chain issues. 
Given the rising concerns over stagflation, where 
prices remain high while economies stagnate, it is 
anticipated that businesses, including the oil and 
gas sector, will struggle due to higher costs, even 
as demand fails to pick up as quickly.

Oil prices are seen facing greater volatility amid 
heightened geopolitical strife that has disrupted output 
from key producers, especially those in the Middle 
East and North Africa. In 2022, OPEC+ agreed to fully 
unwind its historic production cuts of 9.7 mil bpd 
while continuing its active market management. 
However, operational issues in Nigeria and Angola 
coupled with declining OPEC spare capacity have 
trimmed the Group’s ability to react to supply-demand 
shocks. Meanwhile, rising supply from non-OPEC 
producers such as the US, Canada and Brazil, 
including threats of new COVID variants on oil 
demand recovery, will pose downside risk to the oil 
market.
As governments around the world prioritise climate 
change and draw up related policies, adoption of 
cleaner alternatives in the transport sector is set to 
increase at a faster pace. Escalating oil prices will also 
force consumers to seek more efficient transport 
solutions, hastening the transition towards electric 
mobility.
Growing calls for the oil and gas sector to 
decarbonise have also pushed industry players to seek 
and deploy carbon-removal solutions along their 
entire value chain. Slow adoption of decarbonisation 
strategies will stand the risk of being side-lined by key 
stakeholders, namely the financial industry, regulators 
and end-consumers.

Gas and LNG prices are expected to remain elevated in 2022, driven by Europe’s heightened demand as the 
Russia-Ukraine conflict prolongs. Amid a re-opening of economies and  Europe’s determination to wean itself off 
Russian gas, has increased LNG demand. Europe, which consumes more than 500 bcm of natural gas a year, is 
competing for LNG with Asia when extended plant disruptions keep supply limited. Following a subdued 2020, the 
surge in gas and LNG prices is expected to boost developers’ confidence in taking FID for LNG projects.
The number of carbon-neutral LNG cargoes being sold globally has multiplied, from less than a handful in 2019. 
This is due to buyers increasing demand for cleaner fuels to avoid taking on emissions in their value chain, after 
adopting stricter emission targets.
In 2022, the chemical industry is in a strong position for growth as consumer demand strengthens and restocking 
of supplies takes place amid rising demand. The chemicals market is set for a second year of recovery supported 
by growing demand for plastics and packaging amid a growing population, rising urbanisation and improving living 
standards. As the pandemic alters consumer behaviour and amplifies the importance of sustainability in daily 
products, specialty chemicals is an area with potential for faster growth. Rising pressure from consumers and other 
stakeholders is pushing chemical producers to invest in boosting the circularity of their products through plastics 
recycling, battery recycling and incorporating bio-based feedstock in their value chain.

Upstream CAPEX is forecasted to rise in 2022 to around USD500 billion, though spending may remain below 
the peak of USD800 billion achieved in 2014. The increase is due to higher costs that have eroded the 
expenditure’s value to boost production. This has emerged as a cause of concern for the oil and gas sector as a 
lack of growth in spending will impede output growth in the later years.
Supply chain disruptions and increased commodity prices, including steel, will also increase costs. Following 
growing calls to lower their carbon footprint, there will be many players allocating spending on carbon-
abatement technology. 
Escalating oil and gas prices is expected to increase merger and acquisition activities in 2022, opening up 
opportunities for cash-rich companies to expand market share by acquiring smaller rivals. There is increased 
vibrancy in the M&A sphere with opportunities present in many regions. Companies with pledges of net zero are 
gravitating toward differentiated opportunities to swap out and highgrade their portfolios in an effort to reduce 
carbon intensity. The oil and gas sector will be seeing costs rise as commodity prices jumped and the labour 
market remains tight. Some projects under consideration may be delayed as project economics are impacted by 
higher costs.
With oil prices remaining volatile, net importing countries will look for alternative energy supply or boost 
domestic production to meet demand.

The 2021 United Nations Climate Change 
Conference (COP26) has left the world with a 
longer climate to-do list, pressuring governments 
and corporations to transition towards a low-
carbon future. Amidst increasing scrutiny and 
regulations, ESG will be the immediate focus for 
companies as more investors face sustainability 
mandates.
With renewables becoming more cost-competitive 
and playing an increasing role in the energy mix, 
the demand for green hydrogen and energy 
storage is expected to rise, though this is a likely 
scenario for the long term.
To this end, technology and innovative solutions to 
reduce and capture emissions are becoming more 
critical, especially the adoption of carbon capture, 
utilisation and storage (CCUS), and methane 
capture. Carbon offsets are poised for growth in 
the quest to net zero as companies race for time 
to achieve short-term targets. Meanwhile, the 
upcoming COP27 in Egypt this year will see 
governments being called to account for their 
pledges and provide updates on their progress.

Material topics are an essential aspect of our value creation and growth strategy. By addressing these topics, we are able 
to stay ahead of new trends, evolving customer demands and other challenges based on our operating environment.
Materiality Assessment Process
We conduct a materiality assessment on an annual basis to capture topics that substantively affect our ability to create 
sustainable value over the short, medium and long term, guided by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) 
<IR> Framework. Our materiality assessment process consists of four steps:
Identification
We identified a list of potential material topics that 
are important to our stakeholders and PETRONAS via 
an in-house desktop analysis based on a range of 
internal and external sources, as follows:
• Reporting frameworks and standards (GRI, Ipieca, 
TCFD, World Economic Forum’s Stakeholder 
Capitalism Metrics, and SDGs).
• Internal strategies, policies, processes and 
documentation (Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
Manual, Whistleblowing Policy, Code of Conduct 
and Business Ethics).
Stakeholder Engagement
We then conducted a validation process via 
interviews and surveys with external and internal 
stakeholders to assess the impact of these topics.
The stakeholders engaged include:
• Employee representatives including union 
leaders.
• Government and regulatory bodies.
• Embassies, high commissions and foreign 
representatives.
• Relevant legislations in the countries we operate.
• National industry-specific trends and surveys outcome.
• ESG rating and benchmarking agencies.
• Peer benchmarking.
• Internal and external audits.
• Reputation Issue Analysis, Reputation Strength Index and 
internal Sustainability Survey.
Based on this analysis, a total of 52 potential material 
topics were identified.
Prioritisation
We prioritised the identified topics based on two key areas – their 
importance to stakeholders and their impact on our business.
For 2021, the prioritisation criteria also included material topics across 
several areas:
• Occurrence in grievances.
• Topics highlighted by investors and rating agencies in their assessment 
of PETRONAS.
• Discussions at Board and Executive Leadership Team meetings.
• Items identified as significant risks to the company.
Through this process, a total of 14 material topics were identified.
Endorsement and 
Approval
We submitted the 
materiality matrix 
for endorsement 
to the 
Sustainability 
Council, which 
was then approved 
by the Vice 
President and 
Chief Sustainability 
Officer.

Risk Management Committee (RMC)
RMC serves as a central platform to support 
PETRONAS’ Management and Board in managing risks 
and maintaining acceptable levels of risks as well as 
providing guidance and advisory on Groupwide risk 
management system and its implementation.
Risk Management Functions
Risk management functions exist within the PETRONAS 
Group to drive risk management implementation and 
provide risk reporting and assurance to PETRONAS 
Management and Board that risks are effectively being 
managed across the PETRONAS Group.
The above risk oversight structure shall be read together with the “Corporate Governance at PETRONAS” section.
Effective risk management is a fundamental component of our value creation strategy. This has been 
particularly crucial given the increasingly dynamic and volatile landscape, particularly with the COVID-19 
pandemic posing uncertainties on many fronts. Building on our experiences gained in the previous year, we 
pushed ahead to continuously identify, assess and manage our risks and opportunities to realise our strategic 
imperatives. We have a robust risk management and internal control system to build our resilience, 
strengthen our ability to meet stakeholder demands and deliver on our long-term strategic goals.
Preserving Value Through Effective Risk Management
To ensure that the PETRONAS Group is able to continue creating, preserving and realising value, we are proactively 
leveraging on a comprehensive system of risk management and internal control to mitigate any significant risks. This 
system, which includes identifying, assessing, managing and monitoring a range of financial and non-financial risks, remains 
a cornerstone of our business strategy and is fundamental to our goal of delivering sustainable long-term value. It is not 
intended to eliminate risk entirely, but instead to manage our risk exposure across our businesses, while at the same time 
making the most of any opportunities. This system provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Setting the tone from the top, our risk management and internal control system is driven by the PETRONAS Board and its 
sub-committees, namely the Risk Committee (RC) and Audit Committee (AC) as well as the Executive Leadership Team 
(ELT). In addition to the above committees, risk oversight is supported by the Risk Management Committee (RMC) and 
respective Risk Management functions.

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
The ERM process is an integral part of managing the 
business as it acts as a guide to systematically identify, 
assess, treat, monitor and review risks. It aims to improve 
our ability to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of the 
identified risks that may affect the achievement of 
business objectives.
These risk profiles are established through the ERM 
process and monitored at the corporate level across the 
PETRONAS Group. It identifies principal risks with the 
corresponding risk mitigations and key risk indicators. 
This ensures that risks are being effectively managed by 
the respective units.
The PETRONAS Group’s Risk Appetite articulates the type 
of risks that we are willing to accept to guide strategic 
decisions at the corporate level. It reflects our position, 
propensity and acceptability to take risks in various areas, 
namely strategic, financial, operational, and reputational, 
while maintaining legal and regulatory compliance. It is 
defined by the respective area’s tolerance and threshold 
levels. At the corporate level, PETRONAS Group’s Risk 
Appetite is monitored and reported every quarter to the 
ELT, RC and the Board.
Risk assessments are conducted at key decision points to 
ensure decisions that have a significant impact on our 
business operations and strategies are made based on 
considerations of the risk-reward trade-off and to create 
risk-reward conversation at respective decision platforms 
and/or Approving Authority (AA).
How We Manage Risks
PETRONAS Risk Policy
The PETRONAS Risk Policy outlines the general principles and guidelines for making risk-based decisions. Through this 
Policy, we continuously strive to implement risk management best practices to protect and create value. The Policy also 
ensures a balanced and holistic view of exposures to achieve business objectives, thus strengthening our position as a risk 
resilient organisation.
This Policy is complemented by the PETRONAS Resiliency Model, which provides an integrated and holistic view of the 
overall strategy for more effective risk management. It focuses on three (3) areas of business resilience, namely Enterprise 
Risk Management (ERM), Crisis Management (CM) and Business Continuity Management (BCM).
PETRONAS Risk Policy and PETRONAS Resiliency Model
PETRONAS is committed to become 
a risk resilient organisation.
PETRONAS shall continuously strive 
to implement:
• Risk management best practices to 
protect and create value within 
the set boundaries.
• Risk-based decision-making by 
providing a balanced and holistic 
view of exposures to achieve 
business objectives.
Managing risk is everyone’s 
responsibility.
Enterprise Risk Management
Structured and holistic approach to identify, assess, manage and monitor 
risks. The aim is to REDUCE the likehood and impact of identified risks 
to enhance the organisation’s ability to achieve its strategic objectives.
Crisis Management
Comprehensive set of processes that aim to PREPARE the organisation 
to respond and manage crises to protect people, environment, assets 
and reputation.
Business Continuity Management

Crisis Management (CM)
CM is an integrated process that aims to prepare an organisation’s domestic and international operations to respond 
to and manage crises in risk areas to protect the People, Environment, Assets and Reputation (PEAR). Under CM, 
there is a three-tiered response protocol that demarcates the roles and responsibilities of the emergency site 
management, operating unit management, corporate and internal/external response agencies, and/or authorities.
Testing and Exercising (T&E) via simulation of test scenarios are conducted to ensure the effectiveness of response 
strategies and promote continuous improvement, as identified in the Emergency/Crisis Management Plan.
Business Continuity Management (BCM)
BCM is a management process that aims to build our capabilities to recover and continuously deliver products or 
services at acceptable, predefined levels following any prolonged disruption.
Key to the BCM Framework is the Business Continuity Plan (BCP), which aims to enhance the PETRONAS Group’s 
preparedness to recover and restore business-critical functions within a reasonable period, to sustain activities and 
minimise disruptions to stakeholders. T&E via simulation of test scenarios are also conducted to validate the 
effectiveness of recovery strategies as well as maintain a high level of competence and readiness as identified in the

Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS)


Our extensive network of operations and businesses is 
subject to several factors, some of which are beyond 
our control. Whether known or unknown, these and 
other risks may have potential material adverse impacts 
on our operations. The risks set out below are linked to 
our targets of achieving the Group objectives. However, 
this is not an exhaustive list of challenges that we 
currently face or may develop in the future. The order 
in which these risks and uncertainties appear also does 
not necessarily reflect the likelihood of their occurrence 
or the relative magnitude of their potential material 
adverse impact on our business.
In addition to the key risks highlighted below, we are 
strengthening our risk management efforts and 
corresponding disclosures for environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) risks, including a specific climate 
change risk. To ensure consistency with global 
sustainability frameworks and standards, our efforts are 
positioned in due course, to align with the 
recommendations of the Task force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the World Economic 
Forum’s Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics.
Market Risk
Our financial performance is impacted by the volatility 
of commodity prices, change in customer preferences, 
fluctuations in exchange rates and the general 
macroeconomic outlook.
Impact on Value
• Our core business is predominantly in oil and gas. Hence, 
our financial performance is highly influenced by 
commodity price volatility, which is generally determined 
by the supply and demand in the market. The prolonged 
COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse effects on the global 
economy have substantially influenced the fluctuation in 
commodity prices and customers’ demands.
• Other players within the industry also felt the effects of 
the prolonged pandemic, and indirectly, PETRONAS was 
impacted by the performance of key counterparties, 
among others, our vendors, contractors and partners. The 
impact may extend to contractual specifications, non-
performance and counterparty obligations. On a bigger 
scale, this could lead to supply or operational disruptions.
• We have also witnessed a shift in customers’ preferences, 
namely increasing demand for lower-carbon energy 
sources. The change in customers’ preferences and the 
emergence of cleaner energy sources have intensified 
competition within the oil and gas industry, indirectly 
affecting PETRONAS’ value chain.
• The Group is exposed to exchange rate volatility as our 
reporting currency is in Ringgit Malaysia, while some 
transactions are dealt with in the US Dollar. Our global 
presence also exposes us to the changes in the value of 
other currencies and exchange controls imposed by our 
countries of operations.
Strategic Progress

Integrated Report 2021
Risks Linked to Creating Value


Mitigation Strategies
• A review of our Holding Company Units (HCUs) strategies is continuously 
undertaken in response to the wide-ranging market risks and the 
corresponding challenges in generating value from our business. We focused 
on prioritising resources to areas of the highest importance to the 
organisation and business whilst meeting the expectations of our key 
stakeholders. We also proactively conduct rigorous efforts to secure new 
demands within the core business and growth areas.
• The PETRONAS Financial Policy (PFP) sets the overarching philosophy to 
become financially resilient over the long term. Supporting the PFP is the 
PETRONAS Financial Standard (PFS), which outlines high-level principles and 
requirements to promote efficient capital and liquidity management practices. 
Relevant supporting guidelines are also in place to guide and ensure the 
effective implementation of financial management and financial risk 
management practices. This also enables us to identify financial risk 
exposures for improved risk management through required reporting to 
relevant HCUs.
• As part of financial and business risk management, businesses undertake 
regular monitoring and review of counterparties’ performances to identify any 
critical issues with the key counterparties. Where relevant, specific actions to 
limit PETRONAS’ exposure are undertaken.
• To address the integrated demand and supply chain, digital and strategic 
initiatives have been outlined. This enables the creation of new demand and 
optimisation of value within the value chains. The PETRONAS Risk Appetite 
was also implemented across the Group. Key factors affecting PETRONAS’ 
financial performance and risk appetite, including market risk, are reviewed 
and monitored regularly to facilitate strategic decision-making, ensure 
business activities are undertaken within the approved thresholds, and trigger 
actions promptly.

Risks Linked to Creating Value


Legal and Regulatory Risk
Changes in the regulatory landscape and rising climate change concerns could increase the cost of compliance, 
reduce demand for our products, affect provisions and limit access to new growth opportunities. Inherent 
uncertainties due to litigation proceedings could adversely impact our business operations, financial condition, and/
or reputation.
Impact on Value
• As a multinational corporation, we comply with the wide-ranging legal and regulatory requirements unique to each 
country in which we operate. These include critical legal areas such as international sanctions, anti-trust, anti-bribery, 
anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and data protection laws with extra-territorial effects.
• We are also exposed to various claims, suits and legal proceedings that could involve shareholders, labour, intellectual 
property, tax and other matters. The disputes and legal proceedings are often subject to many uncertainties beyond 
our control and can be difficult to predict outcomes. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the litigation and dispute 
resolution process, the resolution of any particular legal proceeding or dispute may adversely impact our business 
operations, operational results and/or financial condition.
• With 46,884 employees in our workforce, limited awareness and misaligned incentives can lead to intentional or 
unintentional non-compliance with laws and regulations by personnel, which is beyond our control. These actions 
may go beyond personal liability, with the possibility of impacting the wider organisation.
• Rising concerns over climate change could lead to additional legal and regulatory measures, including higher 
compliance costs. The nature of oil and gas operations may expose us to potential claims and suits by environmental 
and legal authorities and communities on issues pertaining to carbon emissions, waste materials, as well as 
commissioning and decommissioning activities of our operations.
Financial Liquidity Risk
Our business activities require significant capital investments, sufficient operating cash flows and/or sufficient 
external financing to support business activities and growth projects.
Impact on Value
• Financial performance deterioration and the inability to obtain the required financing during these challenging times 
may affect our capital investments and achievement across our growth projects. In addition, the global or regional 
financial crisis, unfavourable credit events and market conditions may negatively affect liquidity, customers, businesses 
and operational results.
• The year 2021 has seen an upward trend and strong emphasis on green funding and ESG-related investing. Key 
stakeholders such as investors and banks highly focus on organisations that contribute towards ESG. Failure to 
demonstrate our efforts in supporting these targets may affect our competitiveness and ability to tap into the capital 
market as and when needed.
Strategic Progress

Integrated Report 2021
Risks Linked to Creating Value


Mitigation Strategies
• The establishment of appropriate governance, compliance and legal 
frameworks, including the PETRONAS Code of Conduct and Business Ethics 
(CoBE), is central to managing legal and regulatory risks. The Legal 
Compliance Framework (LCF) serves as a control oversight and measure of 
legal compliance for the Group. LCF is based on five critical legal areas 
that could pose as an enterprise risk to the Group.
• Regular communications, awareness sessions and training programmes on 
critical legal areas and specific laws affecting the respective entities are 
conducted by Group Legal to enhance awareness and emphasise strict 
compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
• Compliance levels by the workforce and business are regularly reviewed and 
monitored, aligned to the risk appetite established for compliance with 
critical laws and anti-corruption measures. Strict compliance with legal and 
regulatory measures is emphasised Groupwide. We have zero-tolerance for 
non-compliance to legal and regulatory standards, including acts of bribery 
and corruption.
• We aspire to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050). The 
Group’s Sustainability Agenda supports our efforts in reducing carbon 
emissions and managing other environmental impacts resulting from our 
business operations.

• The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) oversees, deliberates, reviews and 
monitors asset and liability management strategies in managing foreign 
exchange, interest rate and liquidity risks. Our liquidity position is reviewed 
and monitored regularly, aligned to the risk appetite established for liquidity 
and indebtedness levels.
• Like managing Market Risks, we are also guided by the PFP and PFS to ensure 
that financial management and risk management practices are implemented.
• To ensure responsiveness and the Group’s financial sustainability is 
safeguarded in a crisis, we established the Liquidity Risk Contingency 
Protocol (LRCP), which will act as a liquidity crisis management plan. The 
LRCP is carried out by the Liquidity Crisis Management Team (LCMT), 
which has the responsibility to deliberate on impact assessments as well as 
decide on the relevant mitigation strategies and financial levers.
• Engagements with key stakeholders, including current and potential 
investors, banks and other counterparties, are regularly performed to ensure 
clear narration and communication, in line with substantial efforts 
undertaken in the ESG space.

Risks Linked to Creating Value


Health, Safety, Security and Environmental (HSSE) Risk
The nature of our business operations exposes us to a wide range of health, safety, security and environmental risks 
which could cause harm to people, the environment, and our social assets. It may also result in regulatory action, legal 
liability, business interruptions, increased costs, damage to our reputation, and potentially, our social licence to operate. 
Additionally, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has continued to affect the health of our people and operations.
Impact on Value
• Any incidents during business operations could result in injury or loss of life, 
environmental damage, resulting in rectification costs as well as damage to our 
equipment and facilities. A shutdown of the affected facilities could disrupt 
production and increase production costs.
• The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and movement restriction orders globally have 
resulted in interruptions and deterioration of financial performance within certain 
parts of our business. This has led to adverse market impacts and affected the 
health of our people.
• Security threats such as acts of terrorism, piracy/sea robbery, demonstration and 
kidnapping may adversely affect our business operations, the safety of our people 
and assets, as well as causing environmental damage.
Mitigation Strategies
• The management’s clear requirements and commitment are stipulated in the 
Group’s Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) and Security policies. These policies 
are supported by dedicated HSE and Security Management Systems, covering 
requirements for health, operational and process safety, environment and security 
for consistent as well as effective Groupwide implementation. The HSE Mandatory 
Control Framework (MCF) and Minimum Mandatory Security Standards (M2S2) 
provide minimum HSE and Security standards to effectively manage HSE and 
security risks. Both frameworks and management systems strengthen HSE 
governance within the Group.
• PETRONAS is committed to respecting human rights in areas of our operations, 
complying with its Code of Conduct and Business Ethics (CoBE) and all relevant 
legal requirements.
• Operational discipline has been further heightened through intervention and 
oversight via HSE assurances, enhancements to contractor management and 
leveraging of the HSE digital system. The Generative Culture Leadership 
Programmes at all levels focused on psychological safety and conscious risk 
awareness. Process Safety Management was strengthened by establishing the Loss of Primary Containment (LOPC) Reduction 
Framework and the Fire Prevention and Mitigation Framework. The adoption of new businesses and asset acquisition was 
reinforced by accelerating due-diligence and post-acquisition integration processes, as well as firming up our first line of 
assurance to drive an effective management system and compliance.
• Security risk assessments are carried out to identify potential threats, analyse the adequacy of current security measures and 
develop mitigation actions, gap closure activities and countermeasures to address the risk. Additionally, security exercises to 
strengthen capabilities, response and readiness in the event of security crisis and/or incidents are conducted to safeguard 
our people, assets, information and operations.
• Continuous protective security monitoring and predictive analyses are control measures to enable timely security insights, 
taking into account direct and indirect factors which could impact wider security environment in our countries of 
operations. The tailored and bespoke insights developed by dedicated in-house security practitioners facilitate informed 
management decision making to safeguard PETRONAS’ interests in upholding our duty of care. In addition, periodic 
engagements with PETRONAS international businesses are also carried out as a proactive solution to enable discourse and 
sharing on relevant security subject to facilitate optimum security readiness.
• As the risks for the COVID-19 pandemic remained high, the Corporate Command Centre (C3) task force and Pandemic 
Preparedness and Response Team (PPRT) continued to make critical cross-business decisions to ensure the safety of our 
people and continuity of business operations. Directives, guidelines, daily updates and awareness materials are issued via the 
COVID-19 One-Stop Centre. Efforts undertaken in curbing transmission risk within the Group included implementing 
operational green bubbles for key plants and operations, COVID-19 immunisation programmes to expedite vaccination and 
support the nation’s effort towards achieving herd immunity, and strong collaborations with key stakeholders on COVID-19 
management.
• Given the importance of mental health, a series of initiatives and programmes were conducted to address psychosocial risk 
factors to improve employees’ mental well-being. These programmes were coordinated and tracked by the Wellness 
Committee, with regular reports to the management.

Risk Management in Action: PETRONAS’ Health Safety and Environment (HSE) Efforts
Business continuity management is a core element of our risk management strategy. As a Group, we were not spared from 
the global disruptions arising from the pandemic in early 2020. Learning from the experiences gained in 2020, effective plans 
were put in place to ensure business continuity, protect employee health and well-being, and minimise operational disruptions.
1. 
Operation Green Bubbles
 
Given the nature of PETRONAS’ business, about 30 of our assets, mainly critical PETRONAS’ offshore and plant-based 
operations, require the on-site presence of around 500 employees to ensure continued operations. This, however, posed 
significant risks on two fronts. First is the increased likelihood of our people contracting COVID-19 due to workplace 
exposure. Secondly, the large number of people required could lead to significant operational disruptions should there be 
workplace infections.
 
As a result, the Green Bubble Strategy was introduced, whereby screened workers were isolated for a specified period at 
dedicated accommodations away from the community who were at high risk of COVID-19 transmission. This significantly 
reduced the likelihood of COVID-19 infections and ensured operational continuity for these critical projects.
 
We adopted a Green Net approach in places where the Green Bubbles strategy was not feasible. Here, employees could 
either stay at the dedicated accommodation provided or designate their home as the fixed Green Net accommodation.
2. 
PETRONAS Immunisation Programme Taskforce
 
As a responsible energy provider, we made significant strides to expedite vaccination programmes to bring Malaysia closer 
to herd immunity status.
 
Collaborating with the relevant government ministries, state health authorities and service providers, we assisted with the 
establishment of six (6) Pusat Pemberian Vaksin Industri (PPVIN). This includes Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC), Kerteh, 
Malaysia Refining Company Sdn Bhd (MRCSB), Bintulu, Miri and Pulau Duyong Jetty Terminal (PDJT). The PIC PPVIN 
emerged as the first PPVIN established in Malaysia, following a collaboration between the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry (MITI) and the relevant industries.
 
The PPVINs contributed RM4.0 million to support the National Immunisation Programme. PETRONAS also contributed 
another RM750,000 to Pusat Pemberian Vaksin (PPVs) in Kedah, Perak, Perlis, and Selangor.
 
Offshore Outreach Programme
 
Meanwhile, a relatively unique approach was taken to drive vaccination efforts was the offshore outreach programme. This 
first-of-its-kind was conducted in Labuan, Sabah and Sarawak to ensure our offshore operations did not experience 
business disruptions once it was fully operational. It was a collaborative outreach that involved working together with other 
contractors across five offshore locations to ensure the successful vaccination of more than 2,000 employees and 
contractors.
3. 
Strong Collaboration with Key Stakeholders on COVID-19 Management
 
Beyond our Green Bubble framework and vaccination drives, we also ensured our operations were fully aligned to the 
COVID-19 SOPs introduced by the Government. In this regard, PETRONAS maintained regular communication with key 
stakeholders, including the Ministry of Health (MOH), MITI, National Security Council, Department of Occupational Safety & 
Health (DOSH) and various state governments. We also maintained close communication with key government agencies 
where we have an international presence.
 
By communicating openly with our key stakeholders, we swiftly adapted to the dynamic COVID-19 situation affecting 
Malaysia and adjusted to SOPs accordingly, minimising operational disruptions and transmission risk within our business.
 
Beyond regular communication with relevant government agencies, we also consulted with external health and security 
experts to discuss best practices in navigating the pandemic.
4. 
Staff Mental Health and Well-being Programmes
 
Mental health and well-being was another area that came into focus following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
various movement restriction orders implemented throughout 2020/2021.
 
Group HSE and Group HRM organised various programmes, in collaboration with businesses and representatives from 
corporate functions, to address mental health concerns among our employees throughout the organisation as well as 
implement proactive measures to improve their mental well-being. Among the programmes established and conducted 
were the Employee Assistance Programme 2.0 (myFriends), i-C4RE, and Leaders Reach Out sessions, alongside publications 
on mental resilience. These programmes, among others, helped improve employees’ mental health and resilience, thus 
reducing the number of cases of mental illness.

Geopolitical Risk
Hydrocarbon Reserves and Resources Risk
Our domestic and global businesses are exposed to a wide range of political, legal and fiscal developments, which 
could affect our operations and financial condition.
We recognise that our oil and gas reserves and resources may decline over time. Our reserves and resources 
depend on exploration success, project maturation, reservoir or field performance, asset acquisition or 
relinquishment and commercial factors.
Impact on Value
• We operate across numerous countries with differing degrees of political, legal and fiscal stability. This exposes us to 
a wide range of political developments that could change contractual terms, laws and regulations.
• Our global business activities are subjected to regulations and directives of national and host governments concerning 
limitations on production volumes and exports, pricing and trade policies, environmental protection controls, and 
possible nationalisation of assets, expropriation and cancellation rights. Governments may intervene directly or 
indirectly in our commercial and operational affairs, adversely impacting our business.
• The inability to mitigate the internal and external challenges within the domestic and international business landscapes 
may deteriorate our financial condition and constrain our growth capacity.
Impact on Value
• Ineffective management of reserves and resources can severely threaten the viability of our business operations, cause 
financial performance deterioration, and adversely impact our growth ambitions.
• Oil and gas resources are provided in different scenarios and levels of estimations to capture the range of 
uncertainty. While the reliability of these estimates is done via a rigorous assurance process, the estimations still 
involve some degree of uncertainty and may differ from the actual levels. The reliability of discovered resource 
estimates depends on the quality and quantity of technical and economic data, and the production performance of 
the fields, all of which may also be subject to revision due to changes in published rules and guidance.

Risks Linked to Creating Value


Mitigation Strategies
• The Country Risk Management Framework (CRMF) was established to 
govern oversight structure, roles and responsibilities, and assessment tools 
to ensure country risks are managed systematically across the Group. CRMF 
also prescribes pre-entry, in-country and exit management requirements to 
support decision-making concerning international investments and 
managing in-country risk holistically. This is then reported to the respective 
country’s Management and Board.
• Crisis and business continuity plans were established in each country we 
have a presence in to ensure management and recovery from any incidents 
and/or crises. Plans were regularly tested and exercised to ensure readiness 
for execution when required.
• The geopolitical landscape and investment concentration in the countries 
we are in is also regularly reviewed and monitored to ensure it aligns with 
the risk appetite established for our international investments. Frequent 
review of our investment portfolio is undertaken to optimise the value 
generated from the overall portfolio.
Mitigation Strategies
• Reserves and resources are reviewed annually via the Annual Review of 
Petroleum Resources (ARPR) process, as per the requirements stipulated in 
PETRONAS Reserves and Resources Management System (PRrMS). Assets 
are reviewed through in-year and year-end assurance processes, aligned to 
PRrMS. PETRONAS’ international ventures form part of the strategy to 
secure new resources.
• The ongoing efforts to manage production sustainability include the 
development of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology for the 
development of the high carbon dioxide (CO₂) fields.

Technology Risk
Deployment of innovative practices and new technology are essential to our long-term competitiveness. However,  
new technology is itself at risk of becoming obsolete. Particularly where technological advancements exceed the 
pace of investment and deployment.
Besides that, if we inadvertently develop technology that has unfavourable effects on safety and the environment, 
this could impact our financial condition and reputation.
The acceleration of digital efforts across the organisation has been intensified to ensure Information Technology (IT) 
and Cyber Security resiliency. Our inability to do so may impact the safety of our operations, people, environment, 
data and sensitive information. It may also lead to legal and regulatory breaches as well as reputational damage.
Impact on Value
• We remain dedicated to creating and delivering the best solutions to support the growing requirements of analytics, 
where trusted data is liberated for valuable insights. Implementing new technologies comes with an inherent set of 
risks covering adoption, legal and regulatory compliance, cyber security exposure and in-house capabilities.
• Investments in new technology also come with the risks of identified technology being rendered obsolete by newer 
offerings.
• While we strive to deliver excellence in business operations, there could still be an adverse material impact on the 
delivery of our strategy and our licence to operate, resulting from ineffective development and deployment of 
technology and innovation. Inability to develop the right technologies and products in a timely and cost-effective 
manner, or the development of technologies and products that adversely impact the environment or safety of the 
people, could damage our financial performance and reputation.
• Rising cyber security threats could lead to major business disruptions globally. A breach or failure of our digital 
infrastructure from cyber-attacks could result in the loss or misuse of data or sensitive information, injury to people, 
business disruptions, and cause harm to the environment or our assets. It could also lead to legal or regulatory 
breaches and legal liability.
Mitigation Strategies
• To strengthen competitive advantage, we drive dynamic in-house research and innovation solutions. We have the 
PETRONAS Technology Management System (PTMS), which is used to mitigate and manage risks. This ensures the 
development of technology solutions that meet business needs and are also aligned with the current challenges and 
agenda. It curates the value chain and focuses on the technology journey, beginning from ideation, development, 
management, deployment, and optimisation of technology programmes to the commercialisation aspects of each 
technology.
Strategic Progress

• We also maintain a strong position in mitigating risks on the Intellectual 
Property (IP) front. We hold over 4,000 IPs ranging from patents and trade 
secrets to copyrights and trademarks across different technology 
segmentations, including Bio-Chemical and Advanced Materials. A robust IP 
Policy has been developed at an enterprise level to protect our innovations. 
It also provides systematic structure, procedures and guidelines to manage 
our technology IPs effectively. IP Guidelines are also included as part of the 
key processes in the PTMS.
• We have established a strict recruitment policy for our research and 
development arm, hiring best-in-class experts to help develop and deploy 
technology and continuously upskill its current crop of researchers. Group 
Digital is responsible for shaping and driving a unified digital vision and 
strategy Groupwide, as well as accelerating concerted efforts to drive digital 
transformation. This is done via a strong pipeline of technical talents 
nurtured from the implementation of Digital Skill Group and Digital 
Academy, including continuous Upskilling and Reskilling programmes in 
Agile, DevOps, Cloud, Software Engineering, Data, and Cyber Security.
• Group Digital is also accountable for upholding Digital and Information and 
Communications Technology (ICT) governance across the Group in Cyber 
Security, Enterprise Architecture and Enterprise Data. We are guided by the 
PETRONAS ICT Principles and PETRONAS Records Management Principles, 
supported by the ICT Framework, Standards and Guidelines, which set out 
the purpose, commitment and governance of ICT and Records Management 
for the Group. Any incidents involving ICT and cyber-attacks are monitored 
and alerted regularly, aligned to the risk appetite established for ICT and 
cyber security.
• Group Digital established an IT Disaster Recovery Plan for identified critical 
business applications and Cyber Security Incident Response Procedure for 
cyber incident recovery strategies, covering all business units. The Business 
Continuity Plan (BCP) prescribes an overarching strategic response and 
recovery plan to oversee and steer prolonged ICT and cyber security crises 
that significantly impact business operations. Scheduled drills and exercises 
are conducted periodically to ensure readiness in the event of an IT and 
cyber security disaster.
• The Enterprise Cyber Security Governance Framework (ECSGF) was 
established to provide a single consolidated view of the frameworks, 
standards and guidelines required to govern and manage cyber security 
across PETRONAS. It is aligned to leading industry standards and best 
practices, namely the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), 
ISO 37001, ISA/IEC 62443, Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), General 
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Payment Card Industry Data 
Security Standard (PCI DSS).

Execution Risk
Our business, financial performance, and results of operations depend on the successful delivery of complex, 
long-term, capital-intensive projects and asset portfolio optimisation. Insufficient insurance coverage could have an 
adverse material impact on financial performance.
Impact on Value
• Our overall business and financial performance within the Upstream, Downstream, Gas + New Energy, Corporate and 
other divisions are highly dependent on the successful execution of projects. The complex nature of oil and gas 
projects relies on the high degree of technology applied, technical capabilities of our talent, capacity to undertake the 
required capital investments and market conditions at the point of the investment decision.
Mitigation Strategies
• The progress achieved for key projects is reviewed and monitored regularly, aligned to the risk appetite established 
for project delivery.
• Project risk management is implemented following the PETRONAS Project Management System (PPMS) to reduce the 
risk of unexpected technical and/or commercial factors significantly affecting the project’s viability. The PPMS Phase 
Gated Process aims to retain and maximise project value across a project’s life cycle, from identifying business 
opportunities until the operationalisation of the project. This is done to bring a measure of rational processes to 
decision-making associated with the transformation of business opportunities into operational assets.
Human Capital Risk
Our people are PETRONAS’ greatest asset in delivering our strategies and sustaining our business. As such, it is 
crucial to attract and retain the best talents with the right capability, mindset and behaviour to achieve our 
aspirations.
Impact on Value
• Our skilled talents are an important asset to the company and crucial for the achievement and delivery of our 
business objectives, strategies and performance. Talent acquisition and retention are key to our overall human capital 
strategy. We must ensure our talent pool is equipped with the right skill sets and competencies to ensure 
performance delivery.
• The inability to attract and retain the right skilled talents will adversely impact our talent pipeline and ability to remain 
competitive in the market. This, in turn, may affect the delivery of our strategies and objectives.
Mitigation Strategies
• Several efforts have been established to ensure we get the right, capable talent at the right place, at pace.
• Efforts are made to enhance our Employee Value Proposition to attract and retain the best talents to meet the 
changing needs of our traditional and non-traditional business activities. We have enhanced our Performance 
Management in linking to our business targets with a focus on performance and development including coaching to 
ensure talents achieve their full potential. Our on-going HR transformation aims to redefine our talent experience 
towards an empowered, agile, and enabled workforce through people, process and platform to enable better talent 
decision making through analytics and artificial intelligence.

• Group Project Delivery (GPD) provides oversight on all capital, technical 
deployment and plant change projects, plus performs its role as Asset 
Owner Representative, where we are the major shareholder. Throughout 
execution, project performance, cost and scope are monitored regularly. 
Emerging risks and early warning signals are tracked and mitigated 
accordingly to protect the overall project value.
• The risk management of our plant and facilities are governed by PETRONAS 
Asset Management System (P-AMS), PETRONAS Technical Standard (PTS), 
PETRONAS Technical Guideline (PTG), PETRONAS Technical Authority 
Standard, and Plant and Facility Risk Management (PFRM) guidelines. P-AMS 
provides a comprehensive overview of managing physical assets to achieve 
the required safety, utilisation, availability, maintainability, integrity, and cost 
performance of the Group’s plants and facilities, over the design, operation 
and maintenance asset life cycle. It is supported by governing documents 
that prescribe the specific system and work processes.
• Meanwhile, PFRM prescribes the principles and structured processes for 
managing operational risks following the PETRONAS Resiliency Model. It 
guides plants and facilities to systematically identify, assess, control, monitor 
and review operational risks to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of 
identified risks.
• Capability development programmes are conducted to equip personnel with 
the technical knowledge required. Collaborative efforts with peers/partners 
within the oil and gas industry facilitated the transfer of technical 
knowledge.
• We intensified our upskilling and reskilling efforts to ensure our talents are 
equipped to win in the marketplace. We equipped senior leaders to lead 
and navigate the business and the workforce towards achieving 
organisational goals anchored on PETRONAS Cultural Beliefs and Shared 
Values through several key programmes. We also continued to build a 
pipeline of leaders by nurturing leadership at all levels to ensure sustainable 
bench strength for succession. In 2021, we focused heavily on creating a 
pervasive innovation culture at all levels, from Board members right down 
to the masses to bring to life PETRONAS Cultural Beliefs (specifically 
Innovate Now, Customer Focused, Be Enterprising) through programmes 
like Innovation Masterclass (IM) and Agile Awareness, to immerse employees 
in the innovation and agile methodology designed to drive new innovative 
ideas towards achieving business objectives.
• We continuously strengthen our efforts to create and sustain the right 
environment for our people to thrive, through our PETRONAS Cultural 
Beliefs anchored on our Shared Values and fostering Diversity and Inclusion.

“The year 2021 saw the industry stabilise and start to recover from the 
shocks of 2020, albeit in a shroud of uncertainty as the world continued 
to grapple with multiple waves of COVID-19. Valuable lessons were learnt 
about our vulnerability as a business, driving us to step up our efforts to 
ensure that we continue to be resilient in providing the world with the 
energy security it needs. This resilience begins with ensuring the health, 
safety and security of our employees and those they work with; we are 
proud to maintain our solid HSE record, true to our goal that “everyone 
goes home safely”, every time.
Recognising that we have a large part to play supporting PETRONAS’ net 
zero carbon emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050) aspiration, while balancing 
the obligation to deliver energy to the world, the Upstream business has 
stepped up its efforts in lowering our carbon footprint, with several 
projects underway to achieve zero continuous flaring and venting, an 
increased level of digitalisation towards energy-efficient operations, and a 
marked level of collaboration with leading industry players to advance 
carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies and solutions.
We believe that Upstream will continue to be PETRONAS’ main cash 
generator that will provide crucial support for the Group’s sustainability 
aspirations. As the custodian of Malaysia’s hydrocarbon resources, we 
continue to increase Malaysia’s resource base through efforts such as the 
Malaysia Bid Round (MBR), bringing in responsible investors who share the

Moving Forward
Throughout 2021, the upstream business experienced 
volatility due to the pandemic and geopolitical tensions 
that disrupted output from key producers. In 2022, the 
adoption of cleaner alternatives is expected to accelerate, 
given growing calls to decarbonise the sector.
Production is expected to increase as governments 
worldwide focus on increasing the security of energy 
supply.
Upstream will continue to execute its plans anchored on 
making sure our business is safe, resilient, low cost and 
low carbon.
Moving forward into 2022, our key focus areas include:
• Malaysia
 
Our plan to revitalise Malaysia’s E&P landscape remains 
imperative in ensuring continued growth and to make 
Malaysia a home for dynamic and robust investors. 
Focused efforts such as the Malaysia Bid Rounds would 
offer investors attractive exploration blocks and 
discovered fields, with innovative fiscal terms. In addition 
to these efforts, Late Life Assets and Small Field Assets 
are being effectively managed through techno-
commercial solutions with simplified processes and 
governance.
• International
– Canada
 
PETRONAS has a unique integrated position in 
Canada that allows maximising our value from 
Upstream production to LNG markets. Moving 
forward, PETRONAS will continue focusing on 
monetising its competitive resources while leveraging 
on the growing gas demand markets in North 
America and globally.
– Mexico and Brazil
 
We will pursue and realise material growth in Mexico 
and Brazil by focusing on exploration activities with a 
clear path to monetisation to build a value driven 
portfolio. Key efforts are being put in place to realise 
planned resource addition while we continue to be a 
safe operator and partner, leveraging on our synergy 
with partners and host authorities.
• Carbon management
 
In delivering the aspiration towards a low carbon 
Upstream business, the establishment of a centralised 
Carbon Management Division (CMD) shall drive carbon 
capture and storage and physical decarbonisation at 
pace. This is in alignment with PETRONAS’ NZCE 2050 
aspiration to maximise value while executing sustainable 
production through physical decarbonisation of 
Upstream activities, monetising resources from high 
carbon dioxide fields and delivering carbon dioxide 
storage facilities. Additionally, CMD is empowered to 
deliver carbon capture and storage business to generate 
new revenue for Upstream and PETRONAS.
• Technology and digitalisation
 
There will be continued focus and investments being 
placed on key technologies to further compress cost 
while maintaining asset integrity and reliability. This 
includes the development and adoption of robotic 
inspection tools, online sensors, and advanced materials 
as part of the new way of working in Upstream.
 
The development of new competitive advantages is 
being supported through rigorous R&D efforts and 
digitisation of the Upstream ecosystem to help address 
the pain points and achieve higher operational 
efficiency. We are determined to create an agile, secure 
and trusted digital ecosystem that is fundamental to the 
new way of working in a data-driven organisation.

Moving Forward
As the world moves towards a low carbon future, natural gas and LNG continue to play an important role within 
the energy mix, alongside renewable energy. It provides a reliable and flexible lower carbon energy supply, thus 
complementing renewable energy. As PETRONAS’ one-stop-centre for cleaner energy solutions, G+NE is well-positioned 
to meet the changing energy demands by providing a diverse range of cleaner energy solutions.
Key focus areas for G+NE in 2022:
• Maximise value via LNG and domestic gas sales
 
With the expected increase in global demand for LNG 
and domestic gas, G+NE seeks to maintain market 
leadership by leveraging its global LNG portfolio, world-
class operations and customer-centric solutions. G+NE 
continues to build its LNG portfolio through LNG 
Canada and Sabah’s first nearshore LNG facility. For 
domestic gas, G+NE is engaging various government 
agencies and authorities to secure the approval of 
Regulatory Period 2 (RP2) tariffs for PGU and 
regasification terminals (RGT) to ensure sustainable 
returns for our assets.
• Expand market reach through customised solutions
 
G+NE seeks to meet growing demand from new 
customer segments and smaller-scale natural gas 
customers. In this regard, G+NE is expanding its VPS, 
LNG bunkering and LNG in ISO tanks solutions to 
increase accessibility to natural gas. Plans are also in 
place to venture into the power generation business in 
emerging markets.
• Pursue lower carbon customised solutions
 
G+NE continues to expand in renewable energy spaces, 
focusing on solar, wind and energy storage. 
Furthermore, G+NE is also building its Hydrogen 
business with the aspiration to make Malaysia an 
important hydrogen energy hub within the region.
• Advocate for the benefits of gas and renewable 
energy
 
In supporting Malaysia’s energy transitions target, we 
worked closely with policymakers to create the right 
regulatory environment, backed by a proper fiscal 
regime. Given our long-standing experience in the 
industry, we will continue to support Government 
initiatives such as Malaysia’s Natural Gas Roadmap, and 
the Malaysia Gas Hub Study.

sustainability front


A robust governance system drives the successful 
execution of our sustainability ambitions. Spearheaded 
by the Board and Executive Leadership Team, we adopt 
a top-down approach to sustainability, clearly delineating 
roles and responsibilities for improved accountability and 
integrity. The Board plays an active role in the 
governance and oversight of sustainability matters, with 
ongoing efforts to embed sustainability into the Board’s 
scopes. This is part of our continuous effort in 
strengthening sustainability governance for efficient 
decision-making and execution of sustainability-related 
matters.
This year, we appointed our first Vice President and 
Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), who reports directly to 
the President and Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO), 
to provide a dedicated focus on managing sustainability 
strategically in the company. We have also established a 
dedicated Sustainability Council, in line with the recent 
reorganisation of the Group. Chaired by the CSO, the 
Sustainability Council cascades decisions from the Board 
and Executive Leadership Team into implementation and 
deliberates bottom-up recommendations to the 
Executive Leadership Team and Board.
At the same time, the Executive Leadership Team 
receives periodic performance updates on key 
sustainability performance and progress across the 
Group either directly from the respective businesses or 
via the Sustainability Council. This enables sustainability 
issues to move up across all levels of the Group and 
allows the management team to maintain accountability 
for our sustainability targets.
A Future-Ready Board
Board members undergo various sustainability-
related training and engagements to keep abreast 
of emerging matters:
• 
Sustainability discussions as part of the annual 
strategic review and planning cycle.
• 
Imperatives of Human Rights and Just 
Transition.
• 
Engagements with external experts. In 2021 
topics included net zero carbon emission 
strategies and carbon markets.

Sustainability Governance


We recognise the scientific 
consensus on climate change. 
As a responsible global energy 
company, we understand our 
crucial role in lowering carbon 
emissions towards limiting the 
rise in global temperatures to 
1.5°C above pre-industrial 
levels, as per the Paris 
Agreement. We remain 
committed to achieving our 
net zero carbon emissions by 
2050 (NZCE 2050) aspiration, 
strive to reduce our impact on 
climate change, minimise our 
environmental footprint and 
protect the natural 
environment.
Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions
Why is it important?
Our ability to reduce GHG emissions that contribute to climate change today will strengthen our future shared prosperity, 
societal well-being and business growth. Stakeholders are increasingly demanding scaled-up action on climate change, 
with the energy sector facing rising pressure to deliver. Given the complex nature of climate change, concerted efforts by 
governments, business and individuals are necessary to foster a transition to a sustainable future.
An inability to effectively minimise carbon emissions may lead to a loss of stakeholder trust in the energy sector. We also 
need to manage and prevent as far as possible the impact of extreme weather events on physical assets. Despite the 
challenges, business opportunities arise with the transition towards a low-carbon economy and bring possibilities to 
improve livelihoods and revitalise economies.

What is our position?
PETRONAS Carbon Commitments (PCC) 
were established in 2012 focusing on 
reducing flaring and venting, and improving 
energy efficiency. Subsequently the PCC 
have been enhanced with elements of 
carbon capture and storage (CCS), 
renewable energy, carbon offsets and 
carbon pricing.
PETRONAS Carbon Commitments consist of three key areas:
• Zero continuous flaring and venting of hydrocarbons shall be incorporated into the design philosophy of all new 
facilities and projects.
• Malaysia Petroleum Management (MPM) to apply for country-level carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions allowance in 
the planning process of high CO₂ field development.
• Upstream high CO₂ field development shall incorporate carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies at the 
design stage.
• Carbon pricing shall be considered in project decision-making with the option of carbon offsets where 
economically feasible.
Planning and Projects
• Zero continuous venting of hydrocarbons for all existing facilities.
• Reduce continuous flaring of hydrocarbons for all existing facilities where operationally and 
economically feasible.
• Downstream and Gas + New Energy (G+NE) operating assets to meet and sustain top quartile 
energy performance.
Operations
• Renewable energy technologies are to be considered in all facilities and projects where 
operationally and economically feasible.
Renewable Energy
Our business development has increased focus on renewable energy, gas, LNG and hydrogen as these forms of energy 
will drive the energy transition towards a lower carbon economy and ensure the security of energy supply.
To increase our resilience in the energy transition, we work closely with our partners, suppliers and contractors 
throughout the supply chain. As part of our efforts to reduce methane emissions, we have joined other industry and 
non-industry members under the Methane Guiding Principles (MGP) initiative as a signatory member. The rising demand 
for clean energy has also prompted the move towards CCS development and hydrogen, as part of our strategy to reduce 
carbon from our assets and develop a carbon capture business.
We continue to leverage technology and digital solutions, namely the PETRONAS Environment and Social Performance 
Integrated and Centralised System (EPICS), to gain end-to-end visibility of our efforts to improve environmental 
performance throughout our value chain.

circularity will reduce environmental footprints and operational costs.
A major component of the global waste problem is plastic. The throwaway culture has resulted in the rapid disposal of 
single-use plastic, which may persist in the environment for hundreds of years. This presents significant environmental 
and health issues, as plastics can end up in oceans and food systems, affecting the entire ecosystem. To combat this 
problem while still providing the social benefits of plastic, we need to apply circular economy principles to transform into 
a New Plastics Economy (NPE). Through the NPE initiative, plastics never end up as waste. Instead, they re-enter the 
economy as valuable products, thus creating improved economic and environmental outcomes. By driving the nation’s 
NPE, we continue to build our competitive advantage and resilience with the aim to drive the solutions to this global 
problem.
What is our position?
As a commitment to contributing towards United Nations’ 12th Sustainable Development Goal – Responsible Consumption 
and Production, we have set the path towards waste reduction via the 3R (reuse, recycle and recover) practice. We 
implement plans and procedures on waste management at all PETRONAS operating sites. Activities producing waste are 
identified along with the type, quantity, frequency of generation, handling requirements as well as treatment and disposal 
methods. We also conduct periodic assurance on our waste management efforts while looking for ways to minimise 
waste generation. Furthermore, waste performance indicators are reported every month to a centralised reporting 
platform.
Meanwhile, through PETRONAS Chemicals Group Berhad (PCG), we aim to spearhead the nation’s transition into NPE. 
This involves collaborating with the Malaysian authorities and relevant stakeholders through the Malaysia Sustainable 
Plastic Alliance (MaSPA), which complements the actions set out in the Malaysia Roadmap towards zero single-use 
plastics (2018-2030). Additionally, PCG explores ways to convert end-of-life plastic waste into pyrolysis oil, creating an 
end product of certified circular polymer resins. Based on this roadmap, we are targeting to recover 100 per cent of the 
plastic waste of our polymer production volume for the Malaysian market by 2030.

• Innovation
– Collaborated with Plastic Energy Ltd to develop a 
solution that turns non-recyclable plastic waste into 
crude naphtha and further processes it into polymers, 
which acts as feedstock for plastic production.
– Performed a feasibility study with Plastic Energy Ltd 
to construct a plastic waste to crude naphtha facility 
in Malaysia. The objective of the study is to bring the 
technology to Malaysia by turning low quality, mixed 
plastic waste from landfills into naphtha quality 
pyrolysis oil. The end product will be used as 
feedstock for polymer production, enabling PCG to 
offer certified circular polymers.
– Explored other innovative solutions based on the 
three focus areas: 
o ReDESIGN: Enhance the recyclability of plastic 
materials
o ReGENERATE: Regenerate end-of-life plastics into 
valuable materials

Integrated Report 2021
Safeguard the Environment


Why is it important?
Our business is deeply connected to our planet’s natural 
resources. As a responsible operator, we aim to minimise 
the impact of our operations on the surrounding 
environment. This means managing our freshwater 
withdrawal, air quality, potential spills and biodiversity 
conservation efforts to protect the environment.
What is our position?
We integrate progressive environmental stewardship 
practices into our business practices and operations. We 
do this by placing a high priority on ensuring compliance 
with international standards, namely the International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards on 
Environment and Social Sustainability, and the World Bank 
Group Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines (EHS 
Guidelines) as well as leveraging tools and databases such 
as the World Resource Institute’s (WRI) Aqueduct Water 
Stress Atlas and the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool 
(IBAT).
Environmental Quality
PETRONAS’ Environmental Focus Areas
Water Management: We implement internal 
standards, policies and initiatives to optimise our 
freshwater withdrawal. Our water management 
focuses on three main pillars – conducting water 
accounting, understanding water availability, and 
increasing water use efficiency. Freshwater 
withdrawal in areas at risk of water stress is regularly 
tracked, with the water system operating at best-
achieved levels. Wastewater discharge from our 
facilities are monitored, and risks are evaluated and 
addressed.
Air Emissions: Air emissions from our facilities are 
monitored, and risks are evaluated and addressed 
accordingly as part of our integrated air emissions 
management approach. To enhance data visibility, we 
developed an online monitoring platform that allows us to 
accelerate our response rate.
Our sulphur oxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) 
emissions are measured directly from continuous 
monitoring systems or periodic samplings. Measurement 
systems comply with host country requirements or in their 
absence, reference is made to international accepted 
standards.
Oil Spills Prevention: We 
safeguard our facilities by 
incorporating industry best 
practices on spill prevention in 
the design of our facility, 
implementing scheduled 
inspection and maintenance 
programmes, and applying 
lessons learnt from spill 
incidents.
Decommissioning: We ensure that the disposal of 
petroleum facilities adheres to the structured 
Decommissioning Option Assessment (DOA). We also 
work closely with the Department of Fisheries (DOF) 
to evaluate the feasibility of converting decommissioned 
oil and gas platforms into artificial reefs to maximise 
the lifetime of decommissioned structures and to 
contribute to marine biodiversity.

What did we do in 2021?
• Freshwater Withdrawal
– Continued to track the best-achieved freshwater use 
intensity for the top 13 freshwater users that were 
first identified in 2020.
– In 2021, PETRONAS’ freshwater withdrawal increased 
by 11.1 million cubic meters, due to the inclusion of 
PETRONAS Refinery and Petrochemical Corporation 
Sdn Bhd (PRPC)’s Utilities and Facilities (UF) which is 
currently undergoing start-up. PRPC UF’s freshwater 
withdrawal is 14 per cent of PETRONAS’ total 
withdrawal volume. 
– To ensure freshwater use is within design efficiency, 
water balance and internal procedures on water 
systems for PRPC UF have been established.
• Wastewater Discharge
– Continued to monitor discharges from onshore and 
offshore installations.
– Continued to conduct water risk-based assessment 
updates for all our onshore and offshore platforms.
• Embarked on a voluntary, evidence-based management 
system for improved environmental health. This ensured 
safety and control measures were well integrated into

Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS)
Safeguard the Environment


• In 2020 the BES Risk Profiling for PETRONAS domestic 
operations was completed, utilising the Integrated 
Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT), information from 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and other 
published information. As a result of the risk profiling, 
9  per cent of PETRONAS’ domestic operations were 
categorised as “very high” to “high” risk for BES. For 
these operations, a more detailed risk assessment - 
BESRA will be conducted and a Biodiversity Action Plan 
(BAP) will be implemented. In 2021, BESRA was 
conducted for PDB’s terminals in Pasir Gudang, Johor 
and Langkawi, Kedah.
• PETRONAS recognises the need to work with other 
members of the wider business community towards BES 
management. To this end, PETRONAS is actively 
involved as a member of the Interim Working Group 
(IWG) to establish the Malaysia platform for Business and 
Biodiversity (MPBB). The MPBB is envisaged as a space 
for the private sector to discuss, share and collaborate 
on issues related to biodiversity conservation and its 
mainstreaming, in particular to support the 
implementation of the Malaysia National Policy on 
Biological Diversity (NPBD).
• Embarked on a tree-planting programme involving local 
communities in 14 sites across 11 states, a collaboration 
between Group HSE (GHSE), Yayasan PETRONAS and 
Global Environment Centre (GEC). The target is to plant 
50,000 trees by the first quarter of 2022. This is also in 
conjunction with our Walk4Trees programme and 
aligned with the Ministry of Energy and Natural 
Resources (KeTSA)’s 100 million Tree-Planting Campaign.
• Conducted the Biodiversity Tech Talk as part of the 
awareness building process for employees. KeTSA Minister 
delivered the keynote address in a virtual event while we 
presented a paper on Malaysia’s experience in Rigs-to-
Reef, together with two other papers by KeTSA and 
Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB).
Biodiversity
What did we do in 2021?
Why is it important?
Biodiversity is an intricate web that encompasses 
all species, habitats, ecosystems and ecological 
processes that helps sustain life and the natural 
environment. It is closely tied to the growth of 
our natural resources, source of food and 
medicine; critical elements which contribute to 
our health, well-being and the overall economy. 
That is why we need to strengthen efforts and 
drive systemic shifts to promote nature 
conservation, preserve ecosystems and protect 
natural habitats. Our inability to mitigate 
biodiversity loss will have irreversible 
consequences on the environment, humans and 
economic activity. Permanent destruction of 
natural capital will further aggravate other risks.
The Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, 
Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures 
(TNFD) and national policies such as the Malaysia 
National Policy on Biological Diversity (NPBD) are 
developments that aim to reverse biodiversity 
loss. At PETRONAS, we recognise the significance 
of nature and biodiversity to our business and 
communities in areas where we operate.
What is our position?
We will continue to take holistic actions to minimise our impact on 
biodiversity, at the policy level and on the ground, to reverse 
biodiversity loss. Thus, we are shifting our approach from compliance-
based to strategic positioning on nature and biodiversity.
At PETRONAS, we adhere to stringent impact assessment and 
reporting standards on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (BES) set 
by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and World Economic Forum 
(WEF). To protect biodiversity and ecosystem services in the areas 
where we operate, we identify BES risks, leveraging on Environmental 
Impact Assessments (EIAs) and BES Risk Assessments (BESRA), using 
tools such as Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) and be 
guided by our internal guidelines, such as the PETRONAS Technical 
Guidelines (PTG) on BES Management and industry best practices 
from organisations such as Ipieca, International Union for 
Conservation of Nature (IUCN), International Association of Oil & Gas 
Producers (IOGP) and World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD).
In line with our NZCE 2050 aspiration, PETRONAS strives to 
demonstrate visible leadership on Malaysia’s nature and biodiversity 
agenda and the countries in which we have a presence. We aim to 
restore, maintain and enhance biodiversity as we recognise that 
climate and biodiversity are intertwined issues that need to be 
addressed in tandem.

Positive
Social Impact
Our approach to sustainability begins with our 
employees, suppliers, and the communities in 
which we have a presence. To deliver 
sustainable and responsible growth, we 
stepped up efforts to respond in ways that 
would make a meaningful difference.
Why is it important?
The health, safety and overall well-being of our employees 
and contractors is a key priority given the complex nature 
of our work. We are constantly looking for ways to 
improve our processes to create a safe working 
environment because this ensures our employees and 
contractors achieve their full potential, and our assets 
remain productive. In addition to protecting our employees, 
communities, and other stakeholders throughout our value 
chain, health and safety excellence also gives us the 
license to operate over the long term. Our ability to drive 
a safety culture builds our brand reputation and 
strengthens our position as a caring employer and partner 
in the industry. It also helps us attract and retain high-
performing talents.
Despite our best efforts, we are deeply saddened by the 
news of casualties suffered in 2021, where two out of 
three casualty incidents were related to land transport. 
We  held the Safety Stand Down groupwide to pay our 
respects, honour their lives, foster involvement and 
reiterate the importance of safety. Efforts on land transport 
enhancement have been intensified by implementing the 
Fatigue Remedy and Sleep Hygiene programme at targeted 
entities, upskilling heavy vehicle drivers on land transport 
safety, and specific development of land transport 
procedures for newly acquired businesses. We had also 
recorded 10 Tier 1 Process Safety Events (PSE) in 2021, 
a  slight increase from nine incidents in the previous year. 
A  Tier 1 Process Safety Event is a Loss of Primary 
Containment (LOPC) with the greatest consequence as 
defined by API 754, Process Safety Performance Indicators 
for the Refining and Petrochemical Industries. It is an 
unplanned or uncontrolled release of any material, 
including non-toxic and non-flammable materials, from a 
process that results in one or more of the consequences 
as listed in the API 754. Through effective implementation 
of fire reduction intervention programmes including Fire 
Prevention and Mitigation Framework (FPMF), only one 
major fire incident was recorded out of the 10 Tier 1 PSE.
What is our position?
We view our people’s overall safety, health, and well-being 
as a shared responsibility. To foster a Generative Health, 
Safety and Environmental (HSE) Culture, we have put in 
place a HSE policy, backed by a HSE Management System 
and Crisis and Incident Management System, all of which 
are aligned to the International Organisation for 
Standardisation’s (ISO) 14001:2015/ISO 45000:2018.
To elevate Generative HSE Culture and enhance 
compliance, the HSE Accountability Behaviour and 
Reinforcement (HSE ABR) programme was rolled out 
groupwide to amplify and nurture Desired HSE Behaviours 
while simultaneously diminishing Undesired HSE Behaviours. 
In pursuing our annual goal of zero safety incidents and 
fatalities, we are constantly looking for ways to improve 
our processes and systems to make them safer through a 
structured assurance process focusing not only on existing 
operations but also on new business, which is enforced 
through a Post Acquisition Implementation Plan (PAIP).
Periodic exercises and drills are also conducted to ensure 
our emergency and crisis teams are equipped with the 
right competencies. Several other frameworks, namely 
Process Safety Loss of Primary Containment Reduction 
(PSLR) Framework, Fire Prevention and Mitigation 
Framework (FPMF), and the PETRONAS Contingency 
Planning Standard guidelines were also established to 
improve compliance levels. PETRONAS also leverages 
myHSSE, a one-stop digital solutions platform that presents 
challenges, insights, performance, emerging risks and other 
elements to help us mitigate risks.
What is our focus area?
Given the challenging environment caused by the 
COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to safeguard our 
employees and partners by focusing our efforts on mental 
health and wellness through programmes such as MIND-A-
CARE, i-C4RE online, and myFriends. We intensified our 
effort by closely engaging with our partners, including 
suppliers and contractors, to strengthen grievance 
management and heighten HSE compliance in reducing 
incidents.
Efforts to sustain HSE performance were made through 
specific interventions focusing on culture, capability and 
competency, and compliance. Additionally, we continued 
to collaborate with relevant stakeholders to strengthen 
relations and nurture trust, including accelerating our 
readiness towards self-regulation, which has received 
endorsement from the Malaysian national authorities.

Why is it important?
Given the dynamic, volatile and asset-
heavy nature of the energy industry, we 
remain susceptible to security exposures 
which could impact our interests. Our 
extensive value chain is exposed to a 
range of security externalities, from 
protest and terrorism to crime, among 
others. Unpredictability and adversaries 
affecting our Manufactured Capital, such 
as onshore and offshore assets, 
including oil rigs, platforms and 
refineries, may result in loss or 
operational disruption, thus affecting our 
ability to deliver optimum business and 
stakeholder value. A strong and secured 
physical security landscape enables us 
to operate in a safe environment. It 
enables smooth operations and 
uninterrupted productivity of our 
infrastructure. More importantly, allowing 
our people to achieve their truest 
potential wherever we operate.
What is our position?
Safeguarding our people, information, 
property and operations wherever we 
operate remains our fundamental 
priority as a vital business enabler.

pushing boundaries to close security 
gaps by deploying a suite of physical 
and technological security solutions. At 
the same time, enhancing our protective 
monitoring and data analytics efforts to 
propel proactive readiness amidst fluid 
geopolitical environments.
To this end, we continuously fortify our 
physical security controls, supported by 
the right tools, practices and people. We 
are guided by laws and regulations of 
the countries in which we operate, 
including internal governance 
mechanisms such as the PETRONAS 
Security Policy, Security Management

more people, with the notion of leaving no one behind. 
As  part of Just Transition in realising our NZCE 2050 
aspiration, the year 2021 saw PETRONAS strengthening our 
governance on our internal processes to establish Labour 
and Working Conditions (LWC) baseline by evaluating our 
compliance with labour and working conditions laws as an 
integral part of fulfilling our sustainability objectives.
Our work in advocating human rights in supply chain 
continues as per our reporting on page 203.
With our operations located in many countries around the 
world, local socio-political challenges can create complexity 
in managing human rights risks. Despite some challenges, 
PETRONAS strives to uphold our commitment to respect 
human rights and the UNGPs in compliance with CoBE and 
all other applicable requirements where we operate. More 
information on our efforts in building a sustainable energy 
future in South Sudan is available in the Sustainability 
section of the PETRONAS FLOW magazine, in the 
September and December 2021 issues. The information is 
also featured on our corporate website.
As part of our ongoing efforts to reshape our portfolio and 
redeploy capital to our identified areas of growth, we have 
finalised our divestment in Myanmar. This was achieved 
after we conducted a social risk assessment and human 
rights due diligence for our operations there and also 
other sites. We have addressed matters identified from the 
assessment and due diligence by strengthening our 
engagements with key stakeholders as well as formalising a 
grievance management process. Good practices from other 
operations in Malaysia and Canada on engagements with 
communities with regards to human rights and consistent 
monitoring of gap closure plans, have been shared with 
other operations for mutual benefit.
Access to Remedy
PETRONAS provides access to remedy through its grievance 
mechanism (GM). It plays a critical role in opening channels 
for dialogue, problem-solving, investigation and providing a 
remedy where required. GM enables workers and other 
rights-holders to raise complaints freely, obtain effective and 
transparent solutions, and the pre-emptive action needed to 
avoid recurrence. Employees can submit grievances through 
their trade union representative, line manager and Human 
Resources representative for employment conditions 
complaints.
PETRONAS contractors must establish their own GM to 
address their workers’ grievances. For example, in some of 
our operations, such as offshore platforms, chemical plants, 
and project sites under construction, we have designated 
personnel that manage HSE and social grievances by 
employees and contractors. There are also community 
liaison officers to address grievances from communities.
Our GM system allows us to monitor the number and type 
of formal individual or collective appeals received periodically. 
This helps us better understand the types of issues being 
raised, the effectiveness of our GM and methods to resolve 
issues that have been raised. The grievance data allows us to 
monitor salient problems and address root causes to prevent 
further grievances from being raised.

Positive Social Impact


Why is it important?
As a large organisation that relies on various 
products and services from external parties, it 
is essential to build supply chain resiliency. 
We ensure business continuity by managing 
our supply chain effectively, efficiently, and 
sustainably. This includes looking into the 
lifecycle of our products, protecting workers’ 
rights throughout the supply chain, and 
ensuring the safety of our products and 
solutions to stakeholders. We do this because 
potential disruptions could impede operational 
efficiency, business continuity, financial 
performance and overall growth. To this end, 
our procurement practices are responsible, 
fair, ethical and transparent.
Given our long-standing experience in the oil 
and gas industry, we continuously collaborate 
with relevant industry players to drive socio-
economic growth through our supply chain. 
Through our Vendor Development 
Programme (VDP), we promote the 
development of the Oil & Gas Services and 
Equipment (OGSE) industry, as well as Small 
and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), to build 
strong relationships and create more local 
entrepreneurs. Over the longer term, this 
creates a ripple effect in the communities 
around us as this maximises economic 
growth, creates more employment 
opportunities and improves their livelihoods.
What is our position?
Our approach to contractor management is taken from the Labour and 
Working Conditions (LWC) lens, and is part of the company’s overall 
effort to address adherence to health, safety and environment (HSE) 
standards. Under the PETRONAS Contractors Code of Conduct on 
Human Rights (CoCHR), we require our contractors to respect 
internationally-recognised human rights and comply with PETRONAS 
Code of Conduct and Business Ethics (CoBE). PETRONAS expects our 
contractors and suppliers to adhere to LWC principles which are freedom 
of labour, prevention of child labour, wages and benefits, working hours, 
establish grievance mechanism, non-discrimination, freedom of 
association, humane treatment and foreign and migrant workers.
Our procurement system is supported by digital and analytic insights to 
deliver value to our stakeholders, thus shaping a resilient and ethical 
supply chain ecosystem. It is guided by the PETRONAS Procurement 
Standard, PETRONAS Anti-Bribery and Corruption Manual, and the 
PETRONAS Code of Conduct and Business Ethics (CoBE), ensuring our 
suppliers and contractors fulfil the requirements throughout the 
procurement process. Our supply sources are from various geographical 
locations. We aim to responsibly manage our supply chain by 
strengthening our digital solutions and continuously streamlining our 
procurement systems to create a more resilient supply chain ecosystem.
To improve our business practices, enhance productivity and optimise 
operations, we conduct capacity building and engagement initiatives for 
our suppliers and contractors. This is also in line with our high integrity 
standards as we have zero tolerance for malpractices and non-
compliances. We also manage grievances via an integrated platform to 
monitor and manage cases. Meanwhile, in terms of product 
sustainability, we have established several initiatives to reduce our 
environmental footprint across our value chain as part of our net zero 
carbon emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050) aspiration.

Product Stewardship
Why is it important?
Product Stewardship is an essential component at PETRONAS. It ensures we meet the demands for the delivery of safe, 
compliant, sustainable and innovative products and solutions that address market needs and industry trends. It is 
embedded under our research and development (R&D) and aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). We do this because we believe that it is our responsibility to ensure the highest health and safety standards are 
adhered to throughout our operations, public health is protected, and at the same time, business continuity is maintained. 
By adopting a Life Cycle Thinking approach during product development, we are able to create products and solutions 
that minimise our impact on the environment. Additionally, our listed subsidiary companies can provide greater disclosures 
for the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) and FTSE4Good on all environmental impact categories required for 
products.
What is our position?
Comprehensive product stewardship 
assessments, namely, Raw Material 
Management, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) 
and Product Safety Assessment are carried 
out to ensure that future product risks are 
adequately managed. We also constantly 
monitor our impact on the environment, 
ensure our packaging remains within 
regulatory boundaries, and communicate 
information on product hazards and risk 
management measures to stakeholders via 
our Product Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). We 
also leverage emerging technologies and 
innovation as this allows us to penetrate new 
markets, build customer loyalty and 
strengthen our position as a reputable 
solutions partner.
Our product safety assessments are carried 
out in line with the requirements of the 
PETRONAS Technology Management System 
(PTMS) and Strategic Approach to 
International Chemicals Management (SAICM), 
and Responsible Care Initiative. We are also 
guided by the Raw Material Information 
Request (RAWMIR) standards. This helps us 
identify the Substances of Very High Concern 
(SVHC) in our products and alleviate the use 
of Conflict Minerals. Additionally, data and 
information are also proactively shared with 
relevant stakeholders, as required by the 
Globally Harmonised System of Classification 
and Labelling of Chemicals. Meanwhile, LCAs 
are conducted according to international 
standards and best practices.

best practices to support businesses address customer 
requests, augment marketability of products and 
enhance brand value. A total of 37 product LCAs were 
conducted this year supporting Upstream, Gas + New 
Energy and Downstream businesses.

unlock their full potential. Our ongoing Human Capital 
transformation aims to redefine our talent experience 
towards an empowered, agile and enabled workforce. This 
transformation focuses on People (behaviour and mindset 
shift), Processes (simplified and principle-based), and 
Platforms (through analytics and artificial intelligence).
Agile Leadership
We continue to evolve our leadership styles to better 
respond to the ever-evolving environment and industry 
volatility. Key efforts include upskilling the leadership teams 
and employees with Agile methodology, promoting Agile 
practice in the right way and increasing Agile awareness 
across the organisation.
Innovation Engine
We are building a culture of innovation to drive new growth 
opportunities and generate new revenue potential by using a 
think big, test small experimental approach. This method 
will enable our people the tools and support to approach 
innovation through the customer lens, solutions, and business 
validation allowing them to explore non-traditional business 
areas and de-risk premature investments.
Creating and Maintaining the Right Environment for Our People to Thrive
Part of creating and maintaining the right environment is by embracing Diversity and Inclusion (D&I), which is vital for us to unlock 
or leverage the diverse strength of our talents. We continue to offer a wholesome employee relations experience for different 
segments of talents through various internal associations and bodies. The right environment would not be complete without the 
right organisational culture; hence continuous efforts were made to ensure the internalisation of the refreshed PETRONAS Cultural 
Beliefs (PCB) and its alignment to our organisation’s objectives.

Community Engagement
Why is it important?
We are firm advocates for community empowerment, as we believe that the long-term success of our business is 
contingent on the support of the communities we serve. As a nation-building organisation, community development is 
essential to driving the nation forward and ensuring shared prosperity. Strong community engagement allows us to better 
understand and address issues faced by our communities. Therefore, we continue to drive and advance our community 
engagement programmes as it does not only make a difference in the lives of the people, but also deepens the trust 
levels. We focus on enriching lives and improving their quality and socio-economic outcomes as it allows us to unlock 
their potential and enable them to earn and help stimulate economic recovery. Our employees are also encouraged to 
take part in these initiatives as it gives them a sense of purpose and fulfilment.

What is our position?
Our work with communities focuses on deepening relationships, building trust and enhancing our reputation as a caring 
corporate citizen. While the business divisions and other companies within the Group have their own community 
engagement programmes, a large part of the PETRONAS’ Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes are driven by 
Yayasan PETRONAS (the Foundation), with the mission to deliver sustainable impact, improve the quality of life and 
socio-economic outcomes for communities throughout Malaysia based on three key pillars – Education, Community 
Well-being and Environment.
From educational programmes, employment, including food and care packages to providing necessary infrastructure, 
efforts were centred on transforming communities and improve their overall well-being. The Foundation also provided 
COVID-19 relief efforts for those in the B40 (bottom 40 per cent of the Malaysian household income) families and those 
affected by natural disasters with sustainable programmes. As result of our relentless groupwide efforts, we reached out 
to over 175,500 beneficiaries (inclusive of individuals, institutions, households, communities), investing up to RM62.4 
million across all key programmes, including COVID-19 and flood relief efforts.

Integrated Report 2021
Profile of Executive Leadership Team
As of 28 February 2022


“In 2021, PETRONAS had demonstrated resilient performance amidst the difficult global business 
environment. The significant economic contraction triggered by COVID-19 has been a real test of 
corporate governance in practice across organisations around the world. At PETRONAS, the focus has 
consistently been to apply the best practice of corporate governance principles throughout the Group. 
In building a sustainable business, the Board is cognisant of its accountability to the shareholders and 
various stakeholders of PETRONAS. To this end, the Board resolutely ensures that it demonstrates 
effective leadership and promotes unequivocally high ethical standards in its decision-making process.”
PETRONAS is led by a Board whose Directors are collectively responsible for creating and delivering long-term sustainable 
value for the business. A key responsibility of the Board is to balance the interests of the Group and our stakeholders 
including employees and the wider communities we serve. Our governance structure ensures role clarity by clearly 
delineating roles and areas of accountability and recognises the independent roles and duties required to effectively 
govern the Company. The governance structure aims to promote strategic alignment across the Group whilst facilitating 
efficient decision-making at all levels.

Corporate Governance at PETRONAS
Board Governance and Structure


Board Leadership
The Board provides effective stewardship and is responsible 
for the Group’s strategic direction and control of the 
Company. The Board exercises this control by way of a 
governance framework, effective delegation, risk 
management and a system of assurances regarding 
financial reporting and internal controls. The Board is 
accountable to its shareholders and towards a wider range 
of stakeholders such as employees, suppliers, community 
and the Government.
Each Director has the duty to act in good faith and in the 
best interest of the Company. In discharging its roles and 
duties effectively, the Board is guided by the Board 
Charter, a document which sets out the authority, 
responsibilities and operations of the Board.
The differing roles of the Chairman and the President and 
Group Chief Executive Officer (President and GCEO) are 
acknowledged and set out in the Board Charter. The 
Chairman of the Board is not a member of any of the 
Board Committees.
The Board exercises collective oversight at all times. In 
delegating its authority to the Board Committees, the 
Board does not abdicate its responsibilities. The Board 
further ensures that such delegation does not hinder or 
reduce the Board’s ability to discharge its functions. In this 
regard, the Board clearly sets out the division of 
responsibilities in the respective Terms of Reference (TOR) 
of the Board Committees.
Together with Management, the Board upholds good 
corporate governance culture within the Company by 
ensuring ethical leadership, prudent and professional 
behaviour in the conduct of its business and in all aspects 
of its operations.
How the Board Functions
The Board meets regularly, and additional meetings are 
arranged as and when circumstances dictate. Each meeting 
is conducted in accordance with a formal and structured 
agenda and Board papers are circulated on time to ensure 
that Directors are well-informed and that debates and 
decisions are constructive and robust.
Access to Board papers by the Board members is carried 
out online through a collaborative software, with the aim 
of enhancing the efficiency of the Board process. Going 
digital allows the Directors to access, read and review the 
Board papers, as well as enabling the Board members to 
confer with each other and with the Company Secretaries, 
electronically. Board Papers and presentations by the 
Management to the Board are prepared and delivered in a 
manner that ensures clarity and provide sufficient 
understanding of the subject matter.
During 2021, the Board met on 24 occasions of which 
almost all meetings were conducted virtually. Although the 
quorum for the Board meeting is two, majority of the 
Board meetings were attended by all Directors. Whilst a 
decision of the Board only requires a majority of votes of 
the Directors, all decisions were made on consensus basis.
Each Director has full access to the services of the 
Company Secretaries, who play an advisory role to the 
Board by providing guidance on corporate governance, 
ethical business practices, compliance to the Company’s 
Constitution, policies and procedures and the relevant 
regulatory requirements, guidelines and legislation.
The Board may from time to time and if deemed 
appropriate, consider and approve urgent matters via 
Directors’ circular resolution. All circular resolutions passed 
by the Board are tabled at the next Board meeting for 
notation.
The Board practises active and open discussions at its 
meetings so as to ensure that opportunities are given to all 
Directors to participate and contribute to the decision-
making process. Robust discussions and vigorous 
deliberations at the Board meetings ensure that the 
process of effective and healthy dialogue is achieved.
The respective Chairmen of the Audit Committee, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and Risk 
Committee provide regular updates to the Board 
subsequent to the proceedings of their respective 
Committee meetings.
All proceedings of Board meetings are duly minuted and 
signed. Minutes of each Board meeting accurately reflect 
the deliberations and decisions of the Board, including any 
dissenting views and if any Director had abstained from 
voting or deliberating on a particular matter. Minutes of 
the Board meetings are properly kept by the Company 
Secretary.
Matters Reserved for the Board
The Board has an approved and documented schedule of 
matters reserved for its decision as follows:
1. 
Strategy and Management – Strategy, policies, 
annual budgets and major investment decisions which 
include capital projects, mergers and acquisitions, and 
funding requirements.
2. 
Financial, Governance and Risk – Financial reporting 
and control, and risk management.
3. 
Corporate Matters – Reputation and stakeholder 
management, Health, Safety, Security and Environment 
(HSSE), Board and Board Committees’ memberships, 
and Directors’ remuneration and succession planning.

Integrated Report 2021
Corporate Governance at PETRONAS


Board Balance and Composition
As at the date of this report, the Board of Directors of 
PETRONAS comprises ten members; the Non-Executive 
Chairman, two Executive Directors and seven Non-
Executive Directors (NEDs), out of which four are 
Independent Non-Executive Directors (INEDs). The 
biographical details of the Directors are set out on pages 
229 to 238.
The size and composition of the Board is fundamental to 
its success in providing strong and effective leadership. The 
presence of Non-Executive Directors ensures that no 
individual or small group of Directors are able to dominate 
the decision-making process and that the interests of 
shareholders and stakeholders are protected.
During the year under review, the Board saw some 
changes and new appointments to its composition.
In view of the retirement of Tan Sri Ahmad Nizam Salleh 
effective 1 August 2021, Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Mohd Bakke 
Salleh was appointed as the new Chairman of PETRONAS 
effective 1 August 2021. With this appointment, Tan Sri 
Dato’ Seri Mohd Bakke’s status has been re-designated as 
Non-Independent Non-Executive Director (NINED).
The Board wishes to record its appreciation and gratitude 
to Tan Sri Ahmad Nizam Salleh during his tenure as 
Chairman of the Board.
The Board also welcomed Thayaparan S. Sangarapillai as 
an INED and Datuk KY Mustafa as a NINED on the 
PETRONAS Board effective 24 September 2021 and 19 
January 2022, respectively.
The current composition of the Board has a blend of skills, 
experience and knowledge enabling them to provide 
effective oversight, strategic guidance and constructive 
challenge, review and deliberation on the Management’s 
proposals.
The NRC is responsible for reviewing the composition of 
the Board and assessing whether the balance of skills, 
experience, knowledge and independence is appropriate to 
enable the Board to operate effectively.
Diversity
The Board recognises the importance of diversity and the 
value it brings to the PETRONAS Group. Diversity promotes 
the inclusion of different perspectives, raising the standards 
of good practice in Board leadership and enhancement of 
valuable insights in business judgment. Diversity is also 
important to ensure the Company remains relevant, 
resilient and sustainable in the rapidly transforming and 
evolving business environment.
Whilst it is important to promote diversity, the normal 
selection criteria of a Director based on an effective blend 
of competencies, skills, experience and knowledge in areas 
identified by the Board remains a priority so as not to 
compromise the effectiveness in carrying out the Board’s 
functions and duties. The Board is committed to ensure 
that its composition not only reflects diversity but will also 
have the right mix of skills and balance to contribute to 
the achievement of the Company’s goals and objectives.

Corporate Governance at PETRONAS


The INEDs have been appointed for their specific experience and expertise and are independent of management and free 
from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. 
NEDs may serve on the boards of other companies provided this does not involve a conflict of interest and that the 
appointment does not restrict their ability to discharge their duties to PETRONAS in any way.
In line with the exemplary practices of corporate governance, the Board has adopted a tenure policy whereby an INED’s 
total tenure on the Board is capped at nine years. As at the date of this Statement, none of the INEDs has served the 
Board more than nine years.
Conflict of Interest
In ensuring transparency and integrity of the decision-making process as well as to prevent any conflict of interest, a 
declaration of interest by Directors is a fixed agenda item at the start of every Board meeting. A Director who has direct 
or indirect interest in a transaction shall recuse himself/herself when required and abstain from deliberations and voting 
to allow unbiased and free discussions and decision-making. Disclosure of the nature and extent of the Directors’ interest 
and abstention from decision-making proceedings are recorded in the minutes of the Board meetings. The Principles of 
Directorship for the PETRONAS Group was established to govern the way Directors conduct themselves in a conflict of 
interest situation, which corresponds with the Companies Act 2016 and the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics (CoBE) 
of the Company.
The Directors are also required to declare their interests annually, in line with the requirements on the disclosure of 
Director’s interests in the Company’s Audited Financial Statements.
Board Remuneration Policy
Given the highly competitive market, PETRONAS designed a robust fee structure to attract, retain and appropriately 
compensate the diverse and internationally experienced NEDs. The fee framework is illustrated below:
* Only for eligible Non-Executive Directors.

Board Independence
The Board assesses the independence of its NEDs annually. The independence assessment takes into account whether 
the NEDs have demonstrated an independent state of mind and objective judgment in their deliberations and decision-
making process. The assessment on the independence of the NEDs may be undertaken in the following circumstances:
Prior to the appointment of NEDs, the 
independence of each individual candidate 
will be reviewed and determined by the 
Board based on the recommendations 
from the NRC upon reviewing his/her 
criteria per the PETRONAS Independent 
Directors Guidelines.
The Board determines the 
independence of each NEDs annually, 
based on the recommendations from 
the NRC per the PETRONAS 
Independent Directors Guidelines.
Each NEDs has an affirmative obligation 
to notify the NRC of any change in 
circumstances that may affect his/her 
independence status. Once notified, the 
NRC shall re-evaluate the independence 
status and make the necessary 
recommendations to the Board.

Board Onboarding and Professional Development Programme
The Board recognises the importance of ensuring that new Directors have a complete introduction to the business so 
that they are able to make a full and meaningful contribution to the Board. To that end, the Board has adopted a 
comprehensive and extensive onboarding programme for new Directors, including meetings with key senior leadership 
team, bespoke training on relevant regulatory and legal obligations and onboard procedures and processes.
Directors will have full access to roundtable discussions, seminars and other events, covering topics relevant to the Group 
and their roles. The Company provides Directors with the necessary resources to update their knowledge and capabilities 
throughout the year.
A suite of development programmes, known as the PETRONAS Board Excellence tailor-made to the requirements of 
Directors across the Group, has been in place since 2016 to chart the Directors’ development plans in a structured 
manner.

Corporate Governance at PETRONAS


PETRONAS has consistently championed compliance culture guided by the principles of its Shared 
Values and Statement of Purpose. Based on these principles, the compliance culture in the 5 Critical 
Legal Areas (5CLAs) is inculcated among PETRONAS employees through the embedment of a robust 
compliance programme, coordinated and managed by Group Legal via the Legal Compliance Framework 
(LCF). The components of LCF which include the 5 Key Compliance Areas (5KCAs) are our key focus in 
strengthening the compliance culture, supported with consistent messaging from the PETRONAS Board 
and Management.
In operationalising and ensuring global and groupwide compliance, the compliance management team is structured to 
serve the business sectors at headquarters, with regional offices in Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Americas to 
cover all countries PETRONAS operates in. Through a risk based and “adopt-or-adapt” approach, the regional compliance 
management offices support the implementation of Group positions and enterprise controls, and conduct compliance 
programme and activities that adhere to and are in line with local laws and regulations. Frequent meetings and 
discussions are held to ensure alignment of compliance practices and that regional activities are connected and 
communicated regularly with the headquarter.

Training and Awareness
PETRONAS continues to deliver enterprise or customised training and awareness programmes for its employees and 
Directors to ensure firm understanding of the 5CLAs through various digital and communication platforms. Online 
courses, webinars and virtual trainings were the primary methods used in light of the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. 
These methods have enabled PETRONAS to accelerate the training completion by all PETRONAS employees as part 
of its continuous efforts to instill the 5CLAs compliance culture across PETRONAS Group. Throughout 2021, more 
than 90 per cent of PETRONAS employees group wide had completed the 5CLAs online courses.

Due Diligence and Contractual Obligations
PETRONAS manages its third-party risks through PETRONAS Third Party Risk Management (TPRM), a robust due 
diligence process to safeguard PETRONAS Group from any exposure to the 5CLAs in the event of misconduct by 
third parties (e.g. partners, contractors, vendors, suppliers, distributors, agents).
PETRONAS TPRM, which applies to all businesses, enable PETRONAS to detect possible red-flags of potential third 
parties prior to any formal engagement or during the business relationship with such third parties, and to provide the 
necessary mitigation or contractual safeguard against any risks of legal, financial or reputational damage that may be 
caused toward PETRONAS.

Business Practice
PETRONAS reviews its policies and guidelines on a regular basis and endeavours to ensure these policies and 
guidelines are effectively updated and in line with any changes in the 5CLAs. This review is undertaken for 
continuous improvements and putting in place pre-emptive measures to safeguard PETRONAS from breaching the 
5CLAs. 
a) Enhancement to PETRONAS Group Privacy Notice
The PETRONAS Group Privacy Notice is intended to clearly inform individuals on how PETRONAS collects and 
processes personal data. The enhancement of the PETRONAS Group Privacy Notice includes the expansion of 
categories of personal data collected and processed by PETRONAS Group, adding specific sections on processing 
a minor’s personal data and information for data subject in the UK and the EU on the lawful basis for processing 
personal data as required under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 
b) Enhancement to the PETRONAS Competition Law Guidelines
The PETRONAS Competition Law Guidelines was established to outline the main competition law principles 
applicable in all jurisdictions where PETRONAS Group operates to build the compliance culture, hence ensuring 
that all employees strictly comply with these rules in their day-to-day business. However, with the continuous 
evolution in the competition/anti-trust laws, an enhancement of the PETRONAS Competition Law Guidelines is 
essential in making sure it remains relevant and applicable to PETRONAS operations in Malaysia and globally. The 
revised guidelines include relevant scenarios leveraging from practical business experiences to guide PETRONAS 
employees when dealing with actual or potential competition issues.
c) Establishment of PETRONAS Data Protection Impact Assessment Guidelines
The PETRONAS Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) Guidelines is a high-level universal guideline designed 
to ensure the necessary data protection controls are incorporated in the identified processes for the purpose of 
compliance with the PETRONAS Corporate Privacy Policy and local data protection legislation.
d) Establishment of PETRONAS Personal Data Breach Protocol
Personal data protection laws continue to evolve in Malaysia and other countries. It is expected that more 
countries will enact or revise their data privacy laws to require notification to data privacy authorities and the 
individuals affected in the event of a personal data breach. Thus, the Personal Data Breach Protocol was 
established with the objective of providing a high-level process flow in the event of a potential or actual breach 
of personal data to expedite effective action to prevent or minimise any adverse implications to PETRONAS 
Group.
e) Establishment of PETRONAS Sanctions Breach Protocol
PETRONAS Group may encounter situations or issues involving sanctions due to its operations in various 
jurisdictions. Some of these situations require swift action in a particular manner consistent with the applicable 
laws and PETRONAS governance processes. In light of this, the Sanctions Breach Protocol was established with 
the objective of providing specific actions to be taken in an efficient and effective manner, if any of these 
situations occur.
f) Enhancement to PETRONAS Third Party Risk Management 
As part of the continuous improvement to manage PETRONAS’ third-party risks, the KYC Questions and 
compliance clauses on the 5CLAs in the TPRM are further revised and strengthened based on the experience of 
in-house counsels in dealing with various third parties and compliance issues. A simplified KYC Questions 
document and compliance clauses were also established for third parties under special categories that pose a 
lower risk to PETRONAS.

Corporate Governance at PETRONAS


PETRONAS Commitment to Integrity
PETRONAS adopts zero tolerance to any forms of bribery 
and corruption. The PETRONAS CoBE, PETRONAS Anti-
Bribery and Corruption Manual and PETRONAS 
Whistleblowing Policy are in place to guide PETRONAS 
employees and third parties when dealing with potential or 
actual bribery and corruption situations in the course of 
their day-to-day activities. These governance documents 
form part of the controls established under the PETRONAS 
Integrity Compliance Framework (PICF). PICF is the 
overarching framework in shaping integrity and compliance 
posture and propagation of integrity and business ethics 
within PETRONAS Group.
The programmes planned and developed under PICF are 
coordinated and monitored by the PETRONAS Integrity 
Awareness Committee (PIAC) to ensure that they are 
implemented in an effective, integrated, and structured 
manner. In 2021, the composition of PIAC members were 
expanded to include key representatives from Corporate 
Centre and Business Divisions across PETRONAS Group to 
enhance ownership and accountability as well as to ensure 
direct and effective implementation of ethics and integrity 
controls and initiatives within PETRONAS Group.
With heightened expectation for organisations to elevate 
integrity and transparency in all dealings, and PETRONAS’ 
own demonstrated commitment and leadership in the 
ethics and compliance sphere, PETRONAS has further 
strengthened its presence by becoming a member of 
Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI), a group 
under World Economic Forum (WEF). PACI serves as a 
platform for PETRONAS to continuously strive to enhance 
its knowledge and capability building by collaborating with 
other reputable members from other oil and gas 
companies and cross-industry community and participating 
in various experts' discussion and sharing of best practices.
With this participation in PACI, PETRONAS will be able to 
enhance its visibility and branding as an organisation that 
upholds strong corporate governance with robust anti-
corruption programmes and promotes PETRONAS’ visibility 
in upholding good corporate governance and ethical 
business practices.
5
Monitoring and Assurance
PETRONAS ascertains the effectiveness of control established through rigorous monitoring and assurance activities. 
The control oversight and monitoring of the 5CLAs’ compliance are achieved through a structured compliance 
assessment undertaken by PETRONAS entities annually in accordance with the PETRONAS Integrated Assurance 
Program. In addition to the compliance assessment, the on-going evaluations by Group Legal and periodic reviews 
and audits by Internal Audit enable the effective identification, assessment and necessary intervention action to 
address potential areas of non-compliances and unsound practices, as well as the identification of new or existing 
controls to be developed or enhanced to continuously improve the legal compliance posture of PETRONAS Group.

• The Group recorded higher revenue for all categories of its geographical trade in 2021 as a result of significantly 
higher product prices.
• Revenue from exports at RM93.7 billion remained as the major contributor to the Group’s revenue, which accounted 
for 38 per cent of total Group revenue. The exports revenue recorded during the year was 41 per cent higher as 
compared to 2020 mainly attributed to higher sales volumes and upward trending of key benchmark prices for major 
products.
• Meanwhile, international operations revenue which accounted for 36 per cent of the Group’s total revenue recorded an 
increase of 53 per cent as compared to FY2020, also resulted from higher sales volume following improvement of 
travel restrictions as well as upward trending of key benchmark prices.
• Domestic operations recorded an increase of 21 per cent during the year primarily attributed to higher key benchmark 
prices for major products, mainly petroleum and petrochemical products.

Excluding impairment, PETRONAS Group recorded PAT of RM50.4 billion for the year ended 2021, an increase of more 
than 100 per cent compared to RM10.5 billion in FY2020 mainly contributed by higher revenue realised, partially offset by 
slightly higher cost.
During the year, minimal net impairment on assets reported by PETRONAS as compared to last year was consistent with 
most oil majors following rising oil prices and growing demand recovery.

Segment Earnings
The Group operates three core business segments, namely Upstream, Gas + New Energy and Downstream. Corporate 
and Others, which complements our core businesses, comprising primarily logistic and maritime segment; property 
segment and central treasury; as well as project delivery and technology function.
Upstream
During the year, the Upstream segment recorded a PAT of RM34.5 billion as 
compared to LAT of RM10.2 billion for the same period in 2020 primarily driven 
by higher revenue and net impairment write-back as compared to net 
impairment losses reported in the prior year. This was partially offset by higher 
taxation as well as product costs and cash payments in line with higher prices.
The increase in Upstream revenue was mainly attributable to higher average 
realised prices for crude oil and condensates and natural gas as well as higher 
natural gas sales volume.
Total daily production average of 2,275 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (boe) 
per day in 2021, increased from 2,209 thousand boe per day in 2020 and was 
mainly due to higher crude oil production from international operations coupled 
with higher natural gas production contributed by stronger demand for both 
Malaysia and international operations.
Further details on Upstream’s operational performance can be found on pages 136-140.

Gas + New Energy recorded a PAT of RM15.0 billion in contrast to a LAT of 
RM10.0 billion in corresponding year mainly contributed by higher revenue 
coupled with lower impairment losses on assets partially offset by higher 
product costs. 
Higher sales gas performance for the year compared to the same period last 
year, contributed by higher demand from the power sector. PETRONAS has 
also secured up to 697 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscfd) of natural 
gas supply deals from new and existing customers.
More information on Gas + New Energy’s operational performance is available on pages 144-151.

Downstream
The Downstream business also recorded a PAT of RM0.7 billion against a LAT 
of RM3.5 billion in the previous year, higher by RM4.2 billion mainly contributed 
by improved petrochemicals and refining margins, and offset by higher 
impairment losses on assets.
During the year, Downstream business recorded stable operations with Overall 
Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) sustained at 93.3 per cent, on the back of 
strong asset reliability.
Petroleum products sales volume was 262.4 million barrels, higher by 0.6 
million barrels following increased trading activities. Crude oil sales volume was 
109.7 million barrels, lower by 27.7 million barrels mainly due to lower 
marketing volume. Petrochemical products sales volume was comparable at 8.2 
million metric tonnes.
More information on Downstream’s operational performance is available on pages 152-159.

Our Corporate and Others business recorded a LAT of RM1.3 billion, as

Loss recorded in 2021 was mainly due to higher operating expenditure partially 
cushioned by lower impairment losses and favourable foreign exchange gain 
due to the strengthening of the US Dollar against the Ringgit.
MISC Berhad (MISC) and KLCC Property Holdings Berhad (KLCCP) were the 
two major contributors to this segment. MISC recorded a PAT of RM1.7 billion 
during the year, mainly from the deliveries of Very Large Ethane Carriers 
(VLECs), Dynamic Positioning Shuttle Tankers (DPSTs) and construction profit 
for FPSO Project in Brazil. KLCCP’s PAT increased to RM0.5 billion as compared 
to RM0.4 billion in the previous year mainly due to lower operating expenses 
incurred coupled with lower tax expense.
Further information is provided in MISC’s and KLCCP’s 2021 annual reports.

The Group generated free cash flow of RM48.1 billion during the 
year, increasing by RM40.8 billion or more than 100 per cent as 
compared to RM7.3 billion in 2020 mainly due to increased funds 
from operations in line with increase in profits. This was partially 
offset by lower interest income received from funds and other 
investments following lower overall interest.

The figure has been restated to include cost of acquisition of subsidiaries and investment in associates and joint ventures.
During the year, while we continued investing, many projects were affected by the prolonged movement restriction order, 
coupled with supply chain interruptions Both our domestic and international projects, experienced delays and deferments, 
resulting in lower overall CAPEX spent during the year, which is RM30.5 billion and lower by RM2.9 billion, compared 
with RM33.4 billion in FY2020. Notwithstanding, close to RM1.0 billion was spent on Stepping Out, mainly on the 
renewables energy space.

Capital Investments
Segment Capital Investments
Aligned with PETRONAS’ Three-Pronged Growth Strategy, we continue to strengthen our core-business and pursue 
growth, by upholding strict capital discipline. We intensified our capital allocation exercise, to ensure sufficient allocation 
for our core cash-generating assets, and increased allocation for investments in growth or, what we call Step-Outs. Over 
the next five years, starting from 2022, we have allocated about circa 20 per cent of total planned CAPEX, for Step-Outs.
Upstream
• Capital investment for the Upstream business accounted for 48 per cent of the Group’s total capital investment with a 
total spending of RM14.7 billion, an increase of RM0.3 billion as compared to the preceding year which reflected the 
Group’s deliberate action to strengthen our core-business and pursue growth despite the prolonged movement 
restriction orders.
• The capital investments for 2021 were predominantly spent in exploration, development and production activities aimed 
at sustaining and growing production in Malaysia and international operations.
• About RM8.1 billion or 54 per cent of Upstream total capital investment was spent mainly for development of new 
fields. Amongst others, key projects in Malaysia include Kasawari Gas Field Development, Bakau Gas Field Development, 
Limbayong Gas Field Development and Pegaga Gas Field Development.
• Meanwhile, a total of RM6.6 billion was allocated towards international portfolio investments; key countries include 
Argentina, Azerbaijan, Canada and Iraq. The highlights of the investments include Upstream acquisition of 10 per cent 
participating interests in North Montney Joint Venture (NMJV) from Japan Petroleum Exploration Co Ltd (JAPEX) and 
Argentina La Amarga Chica mainly drilling activities.
Gas + New Energy
• Gas + New Energy accounted for 23 per cent of the Group's total capital investment and incurred a total spending of 
RM7.1 billion in FY2021.
• Capital investments for FY2021 were predominantly spent on international ventures particularly for the LNG project in 
Canada.
• Meanwhile, New Energy investments closer to home under PETRONAS New Energy includes solar panel installation at 
Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP), Perak, Institute Teknologi Petroleum PETRONAS (INSTEP) in Terengganu and 
Pengerang Integrated Complex in Johor.
Downstream
• The Downstream business utilised capital investment of RM3.9 billion during the year or 13 per cent of the Group's 
overall capital investment allocation.
• The spending made during the year was mainly allocated towards operational project as well as turnaround activities 
from PCG, PDB and MRC. Other investments were mainly related to Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) which is 
targeted to be operationalised in 2022.
Corporate and Others
• Businesses under Corporate and Others spent RM4.8 billion during the year which was lower by RM1.6 billion as 
compared to 2020 with MISC accounting for 73 per cent of the total spending.
• During the year, MISC’s significant investments were mainly from the deliveries of five units of Very Large Ethane 
Carriers (VLEC) of RM1.5 billion and petroleum newbuild vessels of RM1.4 billion, in which MISC contributed to PAT of 
RM1.7 billion.

Welcome to 
the PETRONAS 
Integrated Report 2022
The world is rapidly changing and global energy 
demand is increasingly growing to fulfil the 
demands of population and economic growth. 
As a global energy company, PETRONAS is on a 
dedicated journey to provide customers with the 
energy they need today in a differentiated way 
in line with our Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 
2050 (NZCE 2050) Pathway to support their 
aspiration for a lower carbon future.
With an integrated energy portfolio, we will 
deliver our core business with reduced carbon 
emissions and at competitive cost. We are also 
expanding our offerings with cleaner energy 
solutions.
Innovations, technology and upskilling our 
talents will be key for us to progress with agility 
and pace.
At the same time, PETRONAS also recognises 
that while the energy transition poses great 
challenges, it also brings many opportunities for 
the industry.
PETRONAS is driven to tap into cross-industry 
expertise through increased collaborations and 
partnerships to unlock new frontiers of what 
the energy industry can offer.
We are confident that with our robust and 
integrated energy portfolio and clear strategy, 
we will succeed together, as we are resolutely 
progressive.

impact on our business  
Our activities 
aim to contribute 
towards the United  
Nations’ Sustainable 
Development Goals 
(SDGs) 
In 2022, we declared our Net Zero Carbon 
Emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050) Pathway

Safeguard the Environment
Collaboratively reduce environmental impact by transitioning to lower carbon 
energy solutions and deploying innovative operations and technologies.

protecting and adding value to the well-being of employees, partners and 
society.

Our Sustainability Journey


Dear Stakeholder,
We are pleased to present the PETRONAS Integrated Report 
2022. In this report, we cover the challenges we faced, our 
strategic progress, financial and operational performance 
during the year as well as our future direction. Our aim is to 
provide a comprehensive and balanced view of our value 
creation process as we strive to fulfil our role as a 
progressive energy and solutions partner, committed to 
building stakeholder trust through transparency.
Scope and Boundaries
This PETRONAS Integrated Report covers the full calendar year from 
1  January to 31 December 2022, unless stated otherwise. The report 
includes all our operations and activities across PETRONAS and its 
subsidiaries (PETRONAS Group), joint operations and associates.
Following our integrated approach to value creation, this report extends 
beyond financial reporting. It also covers:
• Non-financial information, including data from our owned and operated 
businesses in line with industry best practices. 
• Details in areas we do not have operational control over are included in 
disclosures of the management approach. 
• Our financial reporting includes the above mentioned data, following 
the accepted and relevant financial reporting standards.
• Our greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) data is reported for operated 
assets and those in which we have an equity share.
Reporting Frameworks
We are guided by the following national and international guidance, 
frameworks and standards to ensure that our report is accurate, reliable 
and comprehensive:
• The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) <IR> Framework
• International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
• Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards (MFRS)
• Ipieca/API/IOGP Sustainability reporting guidance for the oil and 
gas industry
• Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards
• World Economic Forum’s Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics
• Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
Sustainability Reporting
We aim to integrate Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) principles throughout our business 
strategies and decisions. We view ESG as an integral 
part of delivering long-term stakeholder value. 
Therefore, this report accounts for our sustainability 
aspiration and performance. Additionally, where relevant, 
the information disclosed makes reference to the 
United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs).
Connectivity of Information
To provide an overview of how we create value for 
long-term sustainability, we conducted a high-level 
integrated capitals assessment of this integrated report 
to determine the linkages, impact and synergies 
between our financial and non-financial capitals, 
material topics, stakeholder expectations, strategic 
objectives, risks and opportunities.
Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains forward-looking statements, with 
words such as “believe”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “seek”, 
“will”, “plan”, “could”, “may”, “endeavour” and similar 
expressions used to represent our judgements and 
future expectations. These statements involve risk and 
uncertainty because they relate to future events and 
circumstances and should be considered in light of the 
various important factors. 
The key factors that could cause our actual 
performance or achievements to differ materially from 
those in the forward-looking statements include 
changes to IFRS and associated interpretations, 
applications and practices as they apply to past, present 
and future periods; ongoing and future acquisitions; 
changes to domestic and international businesses and 
market conditions such as exchange rate and interest 
rate movements; changes in domestic and international 
regulatory and legislative environments; changes to 
domestic and international operational, social, economic 
and political conditions; any labour disruptions and 
industrial action; and the effects of both current and 
future litigations.
Assurance
The financial information contained in this report has been 
extracted from the consolidated Audited Financial 
Statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 
and was audited by KPMG PLT. KPMG PLT has reviewed 
this report and did not note any material inconsistencies 
with the said financial statements.
We have also completed third-party verification for the 
PETRONAS Contractors Code of Conduct on Human Rights

Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS) is a leading global energy company committed to powering society’s progress 
in a responsible and sustainable manner. With close to 50,000 employees and a global reach spanning over 100 
countries, we are ranked among the world’s largest corporations by revenue in the Fortune Media IP Ltd’s 2022 Fortune 
Global 500® list. 
As Malaysia’s national oil and gas company, we safeguard and manage the nation’s hydrocarbon resources to ensure 
national energy security and maximise value. We explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons as well as cleaner energy 
solutions. We have three core businesses, namely Upstream, Gas and Downstream, supported by Project Delivery and 
Technology division, which acts as an enabler. We recently launched Gentari, our new entity providing customers with 
cleaner energy and lower carbon solutions in three core offerings – renewables, hydrogen and green mobility alongside 
our core portfolio.
We remain committed to produce oil and gas in a differentiated manner, with focus on reducing carbon emissions and 
at competitive cost. Our hydrocarbon portfolio today is two-thirds gas, which puts us in an advantageous position as 
gas and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) will continue to play a vital role even as the energy system evolves. As one of the 
leading LNG players in the world, PETRONAS will continue to serve the global LNG demand.
As a responsible and conscientious global energy player, sustainability is at the heart of our business and how we 
operate. Our commitment to responsible business growth and positive contributions to society and the environment 
remains unwavering. Fuelled by our passion to be a partner for our customers in the journey towards a lower carbon 
energy future, every step we take brings us closer towards achieving our aspiration of Net Zero Carbon Emissions by

Competitive Advantage
Having transformed PETRONAS from a domestic-based national oil and gas 
company into a fully integrated global energy player, we have gained 
valuable experience that enable us to navigate the energy transition and 
further contribute to societal progress. 
PETRONAS, as a leading global energy company aims to play a key role in 
the energy transition, focusing on energy security and at the same time 
delivering energy solutions responsibly. We became Southeast Asia’s first oil 
and gas company to declare our aspiration to achieve NZCE 2050. We see 
our role as a catalyst to speed up the transition to net zero specifically in 
Malaysia and Southeast Asia, drawing on our experience and reach as a 
global energy company. Strengthening our core business will sustain the 
vibrancy of the local Oil and Gas Services and Equipment (OGSE) 
ecosystem.
We strive for the utmost integrity in all aspects of our business and 
operations, implementing robust policies, systems and protocols to uphold 
ethical business practices and good governance. We ensure our employees 
and contractors work together in creating a safe working environment for 
all.
Our people are our greatest asset and growth partners. They fuel our 
passion for innovation to advance towards sustainable energy solutions. 
Across the globe, our employees lead the way in executing our strategic 
goals, armed with the knowledge and capabilities to thrive in a lower 
carbon future. 
With a proven track record in oil and gas exploration, development and 
production both in Malaysia and internationally and supported by our strong 
financial performance, we are broadening our portfolio to encompass clean 
energy solutions in three core offerings – renewable energy, hydrogen and 
green mobility to align with changing customers needs.

extensive research and development in technology, technical expertise and novel digital solutions.
We continue safeguarding, shaping as well as advancing solutions and positioning future ventures. We are leveraging data 
as an asset, digital as an accelerator and technology as a differentiator. We strive for progress in decarbonisation, value 
creation and business expansion through a well-established and expanding innovation ecosystem to go beyond 
hydrocarbons.
The Gas business is a one-stop centre for lower carbon energy solutions, providing secure natural gas supply to 
customers in Malaysia and abroad through our integrated value chain. As a leading provider of natural gas and Liquefied 
Natural Gas (LNG), we are focused on sustaining world class operational excellence to maximise value from existing 
assets, pursue new projects and supply modes. This will allow us to create new markets and continue fulfilling the 
growing energy needs from power and non-power customers.
We are decarbonising our production footprint and delivering innovative solutions for customers.
With natural gas well-positioned as the transition fuel to shift towards a lower carbon economy, we will continue to take 
deliberate steps in strengthening customer-centricity, operational and commercial excellence, human capital and culture 
development as well as digital and technological innovations. This will be done in pursuit of realising our growth and 
NZCE 2050 Pathway, while supporting the energy security of our customers.
PETRONAS is committed to playing a key role in the energy transition. We are investing in decarbonising our operations 
to achieve our NZCE 2050 Pathway as well as growing our energy offerings as part of our New Business. To this end, 
Gentari was established to pursue opportunities in the energy transition.
Gentari offers cleaner energy solutions through three initial core offerings – renewable energy, hydrogen and green 
mobility, forming a portfolio of solutions cutting across the electron value chain. In the long term, Gentari aims to be an 
integrated clean energy solutions provider, creating greater value, connecting businesses and accelerating the journey to 
net zero.
The Downstream business focuses on enhancing the value of our energy resources, transforming them into high quality, 
value-added products that are distributed to over 90 markets worldwide. Our operations consist of refining, marketing 
and trading crude oil and petroleum products, manufacturing and marketing petrochemical products including derivatives 
and specialty chemicals.
With an extensive retail network of more than 1,000 PETRONAS stations in Malaysia, we offer high-quality fluids and 
lubricants as well as innovative non-fuel offerings such as Setel and Kedai Mesra in 800 locations to make our 
customers’ lives simpler and better. We also own and operate more than 40 Café Mesra that are also available beyond 
PETRONAS retail locations, offering premium quality coffee and pastries for customers on-the-go.
We are expanding our Downstream business by growing in the cleaner energy space with biofuels, circular economy, 
LNG bunkering as well as next generation fluids with PETRONAS Iona Range and installation of charging facilities at our 
PETRONAS stations for Electric Vehicles (EV) in line with our NZCE 2050 Pathway to meet the growing demand for 
lower carbon energy.
Our core businesses are complemented by other businesses, comprising primarily the maritime and logistics segment 
(MISC Berhad or MISC); and the property segment (KLCCP Stapled Group), comprising KLCC Property Holdings Berhad 
and KLCC REIT, constituting 32 per cent of the Malaysian REIT industry, is a subsidiary of PETRONAS that owns and 
manages top-quality assets.

weight tonnage (dwt).

diversify its business portfolio beyond oil and gas. KLCCP Stapled Group is also charting the course towards sustainability, 
moving its properties in alignment with PETRONAS’ NZCE 2050 Pathway.

Tan Sri Dato’ Seri 
Mohd Bakke Salleh
Chairman
Letter from the
Chairman
Dear Stakeholder, 
The year in review has proven that the challenges faced by the energy industry has 
never been more uncertain or complex – where heightened volatility is its only 
constant feature.
The world has emerged gradually from the pandemic, 
with most economic sectors steadily recovering. However, 
the Russia – Ukraine conflict has profound implications 
for the energy industry. The conflict unfurled even as the 
world contended with an uneven and still-fragile post-
pandemic recovery. 
Oil and gas supply disruption has pushed up energy 
prices causing widespread inflation throughout the world. 
Elevated general prices globally compelled central banks 
to tighten the monetary policy, even after two years of 
aggressive stimulus packages. 
The convergence of geopolitical instability, economic 
recovery post-pandemic and accelerated energy transition 
have shaped the contour of the energy market. 
Nevertheless, any perceived progress toward energy 
market equilibrium was observed as short-lived.
As a Group, PETRONAS navigated 2022 with a firm 
commitment to ensure the security of energy supply for 
Malaysia and our customers around the world. The 
responsibility was discharged with focused delivery of 
PETRONAS’ strategy, paired with strong integrated 
operational performance to maximise our cash 
generators, and grow the business portfolio. 
I am proud to recognise how our people continued to 
step up and delivered a strong performance for 2022, in 
line with our strategy of creating long-term sustainable 
value and achieving Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 
(NZCE 2050).

Fulfilling Our Amanah to the Nation and the Countries 
Where We Operate 
The PETRONAS Board and Executive Leadership Team were resolute 
in steering the organisation to responsibly manage the hydrocarbon 
resources entrusted to PETRONAS and to grow the size of the value 
pie for the benefit of our stakeholders. 
We contributed to our stakeholders in the form of cash payments, 
tax, export duties, state sales tax and dividends by adopting 
continued prudent financial management and discipline in reinvesting 
to generate profitable growth responsibly and sustainably. 
In 2022, PETRONAS made the scheduled dividend and additional 
dividend payment of RM50 billion in total to the Government of 
Malaysia after careful assessment of the Group’s affordability to 
continue to fund its operations, service its debts and meet its 
obligations as well as invest for the future growth of the 
organisation.
We were resolute 
in responsibly 
managing the 
hydrocarbon 
resources entrusted 
to PETRONAS and 
growing the size 
of the value pie for 
the benefit of our 
stakeholders. 
PETRONAS recognises its responsibility to also create a positive 
social impact for Malaysians and the communities in the 
countries where we operate. In 2022, PETRONAS contributed 
close to RM900 million for its Social Impact activations efforts 
under the pillars of education (Powering Knowledge), community 
well-being and development (Uplifting Lives) and environment 
(Planting Tomorrow). Over 1.5 million people at home and in the 
countries where we operate have benefitted from our Social 
Impact programmes during the year in review. 
PETRONAS also continued to contribute to federal and state 
agencies nationwide to aid flood preparedness efforts in view of 
the year-end monsoon season. The initiative is part of 
PETRONAS’ RM25 million flood assistance contribution 
announced in December 2021, to assist thousands displaced by 
heavy floods in many parts of the country.
PETRONAS’ commitment to Malaysians and the communities we 
serve remains intact, even as we continue to operate in a volatile 
and uncertain business landscape. Anchored on our Statement of 
Purpose, as a progressive energy and solutions partner, we 
recognise the importance of enriching the lives around us.
Seizing Opportunities in the Energy Transition
PETRONAS recognises the need for a responsible energy 
transition and the risk of climate change to its business. At the 
same time, the need to continue investing in reliable sources of 
energy is infinitely clear from the soaring energy prices that 
consumers are having to contend with. 
While oil and gas will remain as our core portfolio, it will be a 
key anchor contributor to cash generation which is especially 
important as the organisation is seizing opportunities to produce 
oil and gas as well as cleaner energy solutions as differentiated 
products that are produced safely, responsibly, cost-optimised 
and emissions-abated. 
Therefore, the decision to declare a NZCE 2050 aspiration was 
both to demonstrate our stronger commitment to sustainability, 
as well as galvanise us as an organisation towards the necessary 
shifts and changes that would be needed to achieve such a 
target. 
PETRONAS contributed 
close to 
RM900
million 
in 2022 for Social Impact 
activations.
Over 1.5 million 
people at home and abroad 
benefitted from our Social 
Impact programmes.

progressive energy and solutions partner our stakeholders would seek.
2022 is also a year that we bid farewell to a member of 
our Board of Directors, Puan Zakiah Jaafar. I would like to 
express my sincere thanks and appreciation for her 
contribution. Her experience and insights have been 
valuable for the organisation and we wish her every 
success in her new undertakings. 
At this opportunity, I would like to extend a warm 
welcome to our new Board members namely, Datuk Seri 
Asri Hamidon and Datuk Johan Mahmood Merican 
(Alternate Director). These new additions to the Board 
collectively bring diversity of perspectives and wealth of 
experience that will be crucial to PETRONAS.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to extend my 
heartiest appreciation to Datuk Tengku Muhammad Taufik, 
President and Group CEO of PETRONAS, and his 
Executive Leadership Team for delivering our business 
strategies with pace and agility, whilst strengthening our 
foundation for future growth. My deepest gratitude also to 
our employees for their courage and perseverance in fully 
embracing our statement of purpose, shared values and 
holding the organisation to high standards of safety and 
integrity.
Finally, to our valued stakeholders – I would like to 
express my deep gratitude for the trust and confidence in 
PETRONAS that will see us pave the way for more shared 
successes to come. Let us continue to make a positive

societies today and for generations to come. 
Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Mohd Bakke Salleh
Chairman
Fortifying core activities in 
a differentiated manner 
that continues supporting 
the needs of a growing 
population and economic 
expansion by producing 
hydrocarbons at reduced 
emissions and ensuring 
competitive costs. 
Pursuing a credible  
NZCE 2050 Pathway and 
identified key abatement 
levers to reduce our 
carbon emissions with 
short-medium and long-
term targets that support 
Malaysia’s commitment to 
its Nationally Determined 
Contribution in support of 
the Paris Agreement.
Diversifying into new 
energy transition 
businesses that are 
cleaner, less emissions-
intensive, and a more 
equitable energy system 
aligned with changing 
consumers and market 
preferences.
As a result, the PETRONAS Board has endorsed the PETRONAS Energy Transition Strategy that will see the organisation 
intensify delivery of its growth strategy with pace, supported by consistent investment allocation to support our NZCE 
2050 aspiration:
The Board also focused on strengthening PETRONAS’ business resilience for long-term sustainability. Among the 
sustainability-related governance initiatives approved by the Board include PETRONAS Corporate Risk Profile and 
endorsement of PETRONAS’ position on Nature and Biodiversity.
To this end, the Board remains resolute in its 
commitment to ensure PETRONAS demonstrates best 
practices in transparency, governance, reporting frequency 
and profitability in creating and delivering long-term 
sustainable value.
In this same stride, PETRONAS will continue to uphold 
the highest standards of integrity and safety, in 
discharging our obligations and responsibilities as a 
national oil company and global energy player.
The organisation has in place a Code of Conduct and 
Business Ethics, the PETRONAS four Sustainability Lenses 
and other relevant commitments. PETRONAS also has a 
zero-tolerance approach against bribery and corruption 
with strict consequence management.
As we continue to expand our presence across the globe, 
PETRONAS will continue to enhance and safeguard our 
ability to uphold the trust of our stakeholders by 
exercising respect and abide by the relevant laws and 
regulations of Malaysia and the countries where we 
operate.
The Year Ahead
As we look ahead to 2023, the oil and gas industry could 
potentially see prices moderating given an anticipated 
economic slowdown, on the back of prolonged market 
volatility. In this environment, PETRONAS will continue to 
drive operational excellence in our core business while we 
pursue our growth and sustainability targets.
On the back of the strong performance recorded this 
year, PETRONAS will no doubt progress with the drive, 
passion and spirit to provide energy for shared prosperity 
in a just and responsible approach to energy transition.

Datuk Tengku 
Muhammad Taufik
President and  
Group Chief Executive Officer
Esteemed Stakeholder, 
Two years have now passed since the pandemic began, and 
the world in 2022 grappled with the challenges of an 
uneven and fragile post-pandemic recovery. Even as you 
read this, the world continues to remain vulnerable to the 
combined threat of geopolitical conflict, the rising cost of 
living, energy and climate crises.
Energy security concerns are still top of mind for leaders 
globally as chronic underinvestment and shrinking spare 
capacity continued to roil already-volatile energy markets. At 
the same time, many countries and companies remained 
steadfast in their longer-term commitment to the Paris 
Agreement. 
With these realities in mind, PETRONAS responded by 
executing our strategy aligned to our Net Zero Carbon 
Emissions by 2050 Pathway. The Group is committed to 
deliver energy for the growing needs of today and develop 
solutions that will help us move closer to a lower-carbon 
future. 
PETRONAS sees the energy transition as an opportunity as 
much as it is a responsibility to produce oil and gas 
alongside cleaner energy solutions as differentiated products 
that are safe, responsibly produced, cost-optimised and 
emission-abated for our customers. 
I am proud to share that PETRONAS made substantial 
progress during the year in review and strengthened our 
portfolio in order to be well-positioned to continue creating 
long-term sustainable value.
Alhamdulillah, in this stride PETRONAS recorded a strong 
performance in 2022, encapsulating our commitment to 
solving the energy needs of our customers as their 
progressive energy and solutions partner enriching lives for a 
sustainable future. 
With a motivated and passionate workforce driving our 
efforts, I remain confident that the PETRONAS Group is on 
track to deliver meaningfully towards a just and responsible 
energy transition.
We executed our 
strategy aligned to 
our Net Zero Carbon 
Emissions by 2050 
Pathway. The Group is 
committed to deliver 
energy for the growing 
needs of today and 
develop solutions that 
will help us move closer 
to a lower-carbon 
future.

Safety of Our People
PETRONAS’ priority is to undertake our 
business activities with an unwavering focus 
and emphasis on safety.
For an industry that is unavoidably hazardous 
and fraught with risks, our employees and 
partners delivered our strong performance in 
2022 with diligence and dedication to 
upholding safety as our license to operate 
responsibly and sustainably. However, we also 
had challenges.
Regrettably, we recorded four incidents which 
resulted in the loss of lives. The Group 
responded by identifying its root causes and 
has undertaken the necessary actions to 
prevent any recurrence. We aim to do better 
by strengthening our guidelines and processes 
to ensure we create a safe working 
environment. PETRONAS is committed to 
stepping up with our partners and contractors 
to nurture a generative health, safety and 
environment (HSE) culture where everyone 
returns home safely as a shared responsibility.
Delivering Excellence: Performance Highlights
In line with our industry peers, in 2022 PETRONAS delivered a robust 
full-year performance with Profit After Tax registered at RM101.6 billion 
on the back of RM375.3 billion in revenue. EBITDA stood at 
RM170.7 billion for the year in review. 
Throughout the year in review, PETRONAS focused on commercial 
and operational excellence of our integrated value chain, supported by 
an upward surge in commodity prices in an environment heightened 
by supply-demand volatility driven by sudden shifts in the market and 
an accelerated energy transition. 
Amid an uncertain and volatile business operating environment, 
PETRONAS continued to exercise prudent financial management and 
made every effort to reinvest with discipline to future-proof the 
portfolio and preserve our ability to deliver profitable growth 
responsibly and sustainably.
Our priority is in reinvesting towards reshaping and decarbonising our 
portfolio – which means continuing to explore, develop and produce 
hydrocarbons that the markets we serve still need, but with greater 
efficiency and lower emissions. 
We intensified our efforts and progressed steadily in our strategy with 
milestones that include:
• 
First significant oil discovery in Brazil’s Sepia field made with an 
asset designed with gas and CO2 reinjection to lower the 
emissions from its operations. PETRONAS also won the Agua 
Marinha exploration block in the Campos Basin with our 
consortium partners.
PETRONAS is 
committed to stepping 
up with our partners 
and contractors to 
nurture a generative 
HSE culture where 
everyone returns home 
safely as a shared 
responsibility.

a US$250 million hackathon to seek out decarbonisation ideas 
and solutions. The winners have been identified to scale and 
deploy their innovations within 24 months to accelerate 
PETRONAS’ journey to Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050.
PETRONAS is on a stronger footing today, having laid the 
necessary foundation with our strategy and ambition for Net 
Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050. We will continue to strengthen 
our portfolio and pursue new opportunities for growth to 
provide more energy with lower emissions to remain relevant 
and resilient in the energy transition.
Progressing with Purpose: Our Strategic Journey
The frequency and magnitude of energy disruptions seen over 
the past year indicate the need for a balanced approach to the 
transition. We have observed the widespread economic 
implications when an immediate switch from hydrocarbons, 
before an attempt is made to realise an alternative energy 
system is fully ready to shoulder the heavy burden of global 
demand. 
At the end of the day, PETRONAS believes it is about getting 
the balance right with secure, affordable and sustainable energy. 
For PETRONAS, we intend to seize the opportunities and provide 
the world with the energy it needs today with consideration for 
the climate goals of the Paris Agreement. Our priority is to be 
in step with the progress of the societies we serve. 
The myriad of 
challenges in 
energy transition 
are complex, but it 
is our duty to take 
credible actions 
to chart a viable 
pathway to net zero 
carbon emissions.

PETRONAS is driven to accelerate our efforts towards 
shaping a just and responsible energy transition with 
equitable outcomes where nobody is left behind. In this 
regard, I am pleased to share that we have crystallised 
our Three-Pronged Growth Strategy into the PETRONAS 
Energy Transition Strategy that will see us grow our 
business profitably and responsibly with a clear ambition 
to be a ‘progressive energy and solutions partner’ for a 
lower carbon future.
The myriad of challenges in energy transition are 
complex, but it is our duty to take credible actions to 
fulfil our commitment. The Energy Transition Strategy will 
see PETRONAS take bold yet realistic and deliberate steps 
with investments undertaken towards:
• 
Accelerating and intensifying exploration, development 
and production of Malaysia’s oil and gas fields with a 
focus on becoming a low cost and low emissions 
producer. 
• 
Providing greater access to gas and LNG as a 
transition fuel. 
• 
Capitalising on the opportunities of high commodity 
prices for our Downstream business through 
continuous operational and commercial excellence.
• 
Advancing our ambition to establish Malaysia as a 
carbon capture and storage (CCS) hub for the region. 
• 
Providing customers with cleaner energy solutions 
such as renewable energy, hydrogen and green 
mobility under Gentari. 
• 
Offering lower carbon maritime services and solutions. 
Delivery of these efforts is anchored to our Net Zero 
Carbon Emissions by 2050 Pathway which sets out in 
detail the short, medium and long-term targets to 
manage emissions from our operations and strengthen 
the resilience of our business. 
As we look ahead, PETRONAS will require significant 
investments to chart a viable pathway to net zero carbon 
emissions. To this end, we have committed up to 
20  per  cent annual CAPEX for the next five years to 
intensify our decarbonisation efforts and pursuits in 
cleaner energy solutions. 
Consequently, I believe these efforts will continue to 
support key government stakeholders in shaping a 
conducive ecosystem for investments in cleaner energy 
solutions to thrive and contribute long-term to Malaysia’s 
Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris 
Agreement. 
I look forward to sharing more exciting updates with you 
in due course.

Nurturing Talent and Shaping an Ecosystem to 
Thrive
At PETRONAS, our people are our greatest asset. 
We recognise that a shifting energy landscape will require 
significant focus on building a sustainable pipeline of 
talent equipped to keep pace with change and embrace 
the energy transition. 
In 2022, we invested RM264 million in employee training 
and development programmes towards improving core 
competencies and new skills to improve our competitive 
advantage in delivering the PETRONAS Energy Transition 
Strategy.
As we position the company for the future, our 
employees will continue to uphold accountability for the 
resources entrusted to PETRONAS. Our Shared Values of 
Integrity, Professionalism, Cohesiveness and Loyalty will 
continue to guide our actions and conduct as a trusted 
partner for our stakeholders.
From an ecosystem perspective, we recognise that we 
can only achieve a lower carbon future with support and 
effective coordination from our industry partners.
PETRONAS acknowledges its role as a catalyst for 
Malaysia’s Oil and Gas Services and Equipment (OGSE) 
sector. Accordingly, PETRONAS remains committed to 
working with our partners, especially as the business 
environment demands the industry to decarbonise 
operations as part of the energy transition. 
The Group has initiated programmes to elevate the 
robustness of the OGSE as far back as 1993. The Vendor 
Development Programme (VDP), VDPx programme, 
Vendor Financing Programme by Financial Institutions and 
the Road to Bursa Programme are among the initiatives 
to improve the resiliency and maintain the stability of the 
ecosystem at large.
PETRONAS remains committed to increasing domestic 
investment as outlined in the PETRONAS Activity Outlook 
on the oil and gas activities planned for the next three 
years. Nevertheless, our OGSE partners must also pursue 
innovation in lower-carbon technologies to be 
competitive globally.
With a resilient OGSE ecosystem, I am confident that the 
energy industry will continue to effectively contribute to 
Malaysia’s economic growth.
Forging Ahead
Along with the Board and leadership of PETRONAS, I am 
grateful that PETRONAS’ performance in 2022 has enabled 
the Company to continue delivering long-term sustainable 
value with discipline as a national oil company (NOC). In 
the same stride, the execution of our strategy 
demonstrates our continued focus on future-proofing the 
portfolio with a solid foundation to intensify our growth 
as a global energy player.
We remain committed to growing the value pie for our 
stakeholders and OGSE partners to thrive alongside 
PETRONAS. We will also continue to discharge our duty 
in ensuring the well-being of Malaysians and societies 
wherever we operate with secure, affordable and 
sustainable energy.
As the macro environment will continue to be shaped by 
the events of 2022 – PETRONAS must remain cautious 
and rigorously ensure prudent financial management while 
strengthening our integrated value chain with a sharper 
focus on commercial and operational excellence. Even as 
we do this, we will also exercise equally firm discipline in 
reinvesting for our future growth to deliver our Energy 
Transition Strategy.
As we gear towards seizing opportunities for profitable 
growth, we will do so responsibly and sustainably with 
integrity and professionalism.
Permit me to place on record my utmost gratitude to 
the employees of PETRONAS for their dedication and 
valuable contribution to the Group’s performance. 
I  would also like to extend my appreciation to our 
Chairman, Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Mohd Bakke Salleh and 
members of the PETRONAS Board of Directors for their 
stewardship and counsel for the Company to remain 
resilient amid prolonged marked volatility. I would also 
like to acknowledge the PETRONAS Executive Leadership 
for their collective effort in strengthening our portfolio 
to continue pursuing growth and progress towards our 
sustainability targets. My sincere thanks to our valued 
stakeholders – Federal and State Governments, the 
Host Governments of our international operations, 
agencies and authorities, our business partners, 
vendors and customers for their trust in PETRONAS. 
Executing a just and responsible energy transition is 
an agenda that must progress as we contemplate 
and accept our responsibility to the next generation. 
With unwavering commitment, PETRONAS remains 
resolute in its mission and will drive action across all 
our stakeholders to shape an energy future that will 
benefit all.

The Financial Year in Review
The year 2022 was a time of heightened uncertainty 
and volatility for the oil and gas industry. The ongoing 
conflict between Russia and Ukraine triggered energy 
price spikes and supply chain disruptions, bringing with 
it concerns over energy security. Even as supply 
concerns emerged, the call for energy transition 
remains strong with augmented demand for cleaner 
energy. Investors and financial institutions are putting a 
high level of scrutiny on oil and gas players to ensure 
we measure up to what we have committed in terms 
of climate change, emissions targets and cleaner 
energy sources.
Amidst the confluence of these seemingly opposing 
factors, PETRONAS leveraged on our strong integrated 
value chain, demonstrated agility and resilience to 
capitalise on the opportunities from the market 
uptrends. We remain focused on delivering our strategy 
and Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050) 
Pathway by exercising discipline in capital allocation. As 
a global energy player with commitments and 
responsibilities towards uplifting communities and 
supporting net zero ambitions in Malaysia as well as 
Liza Mustapha
Executive Vice President and 
Group Chief Financial Officer
PETRONAS leverages its strong 
portfolio and integrated value 
chain to capture opportunities 
from the market uptrends, 
delivering a sterling financial 
performance for the year 2022.
the countries where we operate, we are future-proofing our 
portfolio by investing responsibly to preserve our ability to 
deliver long-term value to provide energy that is secure, 
affordable and sustainable. 
Our Profit After Tax (PAT) for FY2022 was RM101.6 billion, a 
100 per cent higher than RM50.9 billion in FY2021. This was 
driven by the substantial increase in revenue, as well as the 
effectiveness of our prudent financial management that we 
continue to practice. Our PAT Margin for FY2022 was

27  per cent, a significant increase from 21 per 
cent in FY2021, testament to our commercial and 
operational excellence as well as effective cost 
control measures. Some examples of such 
measures include fuel consumption management 
and vessel optimisation.
Our revenue for FY2022 was RM375.3 billion 
compared to RM248.0 billion in FY2021, 
representing a 51 per cent increase. The 
substantial rise in revenue was driven by higher 
average realised prices for all products against the 
backdrop of concerns in relation to energy 
security, coupled with favourable impact from 
foreign exchange. More than 70 per cent of 
PETRONAS’ revenue was contributed by 
customers outside Malaysia, demonstrating our 
strong global presence. 
Our Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation 
and Amortisation (EBITDA) for FY2022 was 
RM170.7 billion, a 70 per cent increase in line 
with the higher profit recorded.
Businesses across the value chain took bold choices and displayed 
operational resilience and commercial excellence, allowing us to 
capture market uptrends, resulting in the strong financial 
performance.
Strong Financial Position
The unpredictable energy markets, coupled with the possibility 
of a global economic slowdown as well as rising inflation has 
led to increase in operating costs. Despite these challenges, 
PETRONAS continues to maintain its strong liquidity by 
exercising effective cost management and delivering solid 
financial performance.
We recorded robust cash flows from operating activities of 
RM135.3 billion, a 72 per cent increase from FY2021, enabling 
us to increase investments required for growth, make higher 
dividend payments, service our debt obligations and increase 
contributions to support economic and social development. 
Additionally, we recorded gearing of 20.3 per cent in FY2022, 
2.8 per cent lower than FY2021. This strengthened the Group’s 
net cash position to RM108.0 billion. Our net cash position 
compares favourably with that of our peer group comprising 
international oil majors.
Total assets stood at RM710.6 billion as at 31 December 2022, 
an increase of 12 per cent against the previous year. This was 
mainly contributed by the higher cash position as well as higher 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets following 
new acquisitions during the year.
Capital Allocation
Amid the continued volatility of the energy market and the 
increasing call for energy transition, we remain steadfast in 
strengthening our portfolio through strict capital discipline, 
ensuring sufficient allocation for our core cash generators, as 
well as investments in new business and intensify emissions 
abatement efforts.
As activity started to pick up across the globe, our capital 
investment spending in FY2022 grew 65 per cent from the 
previous year to RM50.1 billion. 25 per cent of the capital 
investment spent in FY2022 was on New Business.

Domestic Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) increased by 
24 per cent against the same period last year, 
contributing to the growth of the Malaysian oil and 
gas industry.
International CAPEX also increased as investments 
were channeled mainly to non-traditional businesses 
such as specialty chemicals. Excluding international 
acquisitions made during the year, the CAPEX spent 
was almost equal for Malaysia and international 
projects. 
Capital investment allocation over the next five years 
i.e. between FY2023 to FY2027 is expected to be 43 
per cent higher than the last five years i.e. between 
FY2018 to FY2022, mainly as a result of scaling up 
investments in the core business, lowering our 
emissions as well as investing in new business to 
future-proof the Group’s portfolio.

Additionally, PETRONAS also supported Peninsular Malaysia’s power and non-power sector in respect of the 
regulated gas pricing mechanism imposed on the supply of sales gas, which resulted in total accumulated 
revenue forgone from FY1997 until FY2020 amounted to RM261.04 billion. By the end of FY2020, all contracts 
have reached convergence between the regulated price and contract price.
Contributions to the Government
We contributed RM93.1 billion to the Federal and State Governments of Malaysia in the form of dividends, taxes and 
cash payments, higher by RM44.8 billion or 93 per cent compared to the previous year. This also includes contributions 
made to National Trust Fund (NTF) of RM500 million.
To date, our cumulative contributions to the Federal Government of Malaysia, state governments and NTF amounts to 
RM1.4 trillion.
In FY2022, we paid total dividends to the Federal Government of Malaysia of RM50.0 billion, higher by RM25.0 billion as 
compared to FY2021, in line with our profitability and affordability.

Letter from the Executive Vice  
President and Group Chief Financial Officer


Dear Stakeholder,
Over the past year, PETRONAS has made significant progress in our sustainability journey. We 
continued integrating sustainability in our strategic execution and the future of our business. As a 
global energy company, this is no simple feat. Our ability to create long-term value is not only 
driven by market forces – we also have broader responsibilities to bear. We are committed to 
contribute towards government efforts to decarbonise economic development while delivering 
reliable energy that supports progressive growth. Our impact is far-reaching and we remain 
steadfast in using our scale, technology and talents to provide the energy solutions our customers 
desire for a sustainable future. Therefore, I am pleased to share my assessment of the Group’s 
sustainability performance and journey for 2022.

Sustainability 
Officer
We remain steadfast in using 
our scale, technology and 
talents to provide the energy 
solutions our customers desire 
for a sustainable future.
Trends Signal a Sustainable Energy Future 
2022 was another tumultuous year. The extraordinary 
health crisis brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, was 
overtaken by a global energy crisis, high inflation, supply 
disruptions and compounding effects of climate change. 
Instability continues to surround economic activity, 
weakening long-term prospects for global growth and 
social progress. Energy security remains a key concern for 
political leaders across the world, yet the underlying trend 
of decarbonisation remains strong with renewed 
momentum.
Despite volatile geopolitics, addressing climate change, 
nature loss and persistent inequality continue to serve as 
a common ground for international collaboration. The 
United Nations convened conferences on climate change 
(COP27) and biodiversity (COP15) in 2022 demonstrated 
strong participation and engagement by all relevant 
parties. Overall, sustainability considerations continue to 
drive developments in public policy, regulation, investment 
decisions and business development. 
The scale of change brought on by the energy transition 
is hard to overstate. Today, we see transformative policy 
instruments at play internationally, driving large-scale shifts 
into new renewable and low carbon energy value chains. 
In Malaysia, broad climate aspirations are translated into 
more specific policy developments and practical deliveries. 
The National Energy Policy (NEP 2040) was launched in 
September 2022. It frames the context for optimising the 
value of national oil and gas resources, while capitalising 
on growth opportunities from the global energy transition. 
NEP 2040 presents low carbon growth pathways that 
include a higher share of renewable energy, financing and 
incentives to drive energy efficiency, green mobility, 
hydrogen, circular economy, biofuels and carbon capture, 
utilisation and storage (CCUS).
In December 2022, Bursa Malaysia Bhd launched the 
Bursa Carbon Exchange (BCX), a voluntary carbon market 
and the world’s first shariah-compliant carbon exchange.
A Sustainable Approach to Value
The strong emphasis we have on sustainability gives 
PETRONAS a vital understanding of how changes in 
society affect our risk landscape. It helps us be 
responsive, operate effectively, align new opportunities for 
investment and attract talents. We do not see a trade-off 
between value creation and sustainability. We can only 
succeed, if we use our scale, technology and skills to 
provide the energy solutions our customers desire.
Each country has energy accessibility, affordability and 
sustainability concerns that require tailored responses. 
PETRONAS is building strength and expertise in responding 
effectively to the evolving context in energy markets, 
while balancing short-term demands of continued energy 
supply with long-term responsible growth. 
In support of our strategy, we have launched our Net 
Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050) Pathway 
that sets clear milestone targets for reducing our 
operational emissions and frames our growth ambitions in 
new areas.
Becoming a Net Zero Energy Company
For PETRONAS, we intend to capture the opportunities 
and provide the world with the energy it needs with 
consideration for the climate goals of the Paris Agreement. 
With our integrated energy portfolio, we serve as the 
custodian of Malaysia’s hydrocarbon resources, while 
transforming in line with our published NZCE 2050 Pathway. 
Our NZCE 2050 Pathway stipulates emissions reduction from 
our own operations and growth ambitions for clean energy 
solutions, enabled by a 20 per cent allocation of total capital 
expenditure over the period of 2022-2026. Delivery of 
these targets is anchored on our business context, national 
policies, international frameworks and scientific consensus 
on climate change.
2022 saw growth in our energy production, after the 
disruptive years of the COVID-19 pandemic prior. Our 
Groupwide absolute greenhouse gas emissions have also 
risen. While some of it can be attributed to changes in our 
accounting method, we are determined to decouple growth 
of our business from emissions. To this aim, we have set 
ourselves absolute emissions targets.
Our near-term target is to cap operational emissions at 49.5 
million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Million tCO2e) 
by 2024 in Malaysia. Our 2030 target is to achieve a 25 
per cent absolute emissions reduction Groupwide, based 
on 2019 emissions data, for our own emissions and the 
emissions from the energy we buy (Scopes 1 and 2).

We are on track to meet our 2024 target and we have 
reduced our GHG emissions by 8.49 per cent against our 
2030 target of 25 per cent absolute emissions reduction 
against 2019 baseline.
Our targets include specific provisions for methane 
emissions reduction: 50 per cent by 2025 and 70 per cent by 
2030, from 2019 levels, for PETRONAS’ groupwide natural 
gas value chain. In support of Malaysia’s commitment to 
the Global Methane Pledge of reducing national methane 
emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 from 2020 levels, 
PETRONAS is going beyond its own operations and has 
set a 50 per cent methane emissions reduction target for 
Malaysia’s natural gas value chain. 
Key levers for reducing our operational emissions are: zero 
routine flaring and venting, energy efficiency, electrification 
and carbon capture and storage (CCS). 
CCS is an essential component in global decarbonisation, 
providing substantive emissions reduction potential for 
oil and gas and hard-to-abate industrial sectors. Towards 
this aim, we now have a centralised Carbon Management 
Division to drive emissions management, including CCS, 
laying the foundation for such practice in Malaysia to serve 
both domestic and international commercial industrial 
customers.
Gentari has been established to deliver clean energy 
solutions that will assist customers to achieve their 
respective net zero carbon emission aspirations. Gentari has 
strong growth ambitions for 2030: 30-40GW of renewable 
energy capacity, up to 1.2 million tonnes per annum of 
hydrogen and 10 per cent market share of public electric 
charging points across Asia Pacific. 
We are also making inroads into the biofuels market with 
plans for a greenfield biorefinery and co-processing at 
existing facilities, slated for 2025. The biorefinery will provide 
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) with operational flexibility and 
generate hydrogenated vegetable oil or renewable diesel. 
We launched our NZCE 2050 Pathway to our top leaders 
in October 2022, followed by master classes to ensure a 
common vision and accelerated delivery by our highly skilled 
engineering teams, across all parts of the business.
The targets set forth by the NZCE 2050 Pathway are bold 
and ambitious. Buoyed by strong performance of the past 
decade of reducing emissions by 18.1 million tonnes of 
carbon dioxide equivalent cumulatively and our recent 
impactful acquisitions of specialty chemicals businesses with 
strong sustainability credentials, will hold us in a good stead 
to reach our stretch targets. 
In support of our NZCE 2050 Pathway, since 2022, senior 
leader’s long-term incentive plan includes a 20 per cent 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) element 
encompassing measures relating to the attainment of our 
Pathway and diversity and inclusion.
Protecting Our Natural Environment
In December 2022, the United Nations brokered a milestone 
agreement of halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030 
through conserving at least 30 per cent of land, freshwater 
and oceans globally. 
We recognise the importance of conserving nature and 
biodiversity and the interlinkages with climate change. Both 
areas need to be addressed in parallel. This is why with the 
approval of the PETRONAS Board, we have established 
PETRONAS’ Position on Nature and Biodiversity, through 
which wherever possible, we aim to conserve, protect and 
restore nature. 
As one of the most recognised brands in the region, we 
see the need to demonstrate visible leadership in countries 
where we operate, not least in Malaysia that is regarded as 
one of only 17 mega biodiversity countries in the world. 
To attain net zero carbon emissions by 2050, PETRONAS will 
require carbon offsets for residual emissions that cannot be 
avoided or mitigated. For this purpose, PETRONAS will invest 
in nature-based solutions. 
Our near-term target is to 
cap operational emissions 
at 49.5 Million tCO2e by 
2024 in Malaysia.
Letter from the Vice President and 
Chief Sustainability Officer
In Malaysia, we promote the development of high-quality 
nature-based projects to generate carbon credits certified 
in accordance with credible international standards. Project 
development would help channel much needed funds 
towards land use impact mitigation, forest conservation, 
peatland management, as well as mangrove, seagrass and 
coral reef conservation.
Environmental management remains a key focus for our 
continuous improvement efforts. During 2022, we saw a 
negative trend for some of our key indicators, most notably 
for sulphur oxide emissions and hazardous waste, which we 
are determined to reverse in the coming year.
Supporting Our People and Enriching Lives
The safety and well-being of our employees, contractors and 
surrounding communities is central to the success of our 
daily operations. 
In 2022, we placed a particular importance on employees’ 
mental well-being. Our Executive Leadership Team was 
directly involved through sharing of personal experiences, 
thus lifting the stigma that may typically be associated with 
mental health issues. An end-to-end prevention and support 
programme was established, with early signs of making a 
positive impact. During the year, efforts to enhance diversity 
and inclusion were undertaken to create a more progressive 
work environment, focusing on leadership and governance, 
communication, education and culture. 
Recognising the need to upskill existing talents to deliver our 
NZCE 2050 Pathway, we have also prioritised sustainability 
capability development. Beyond our own workforce, our 
extensive value chain and global presence exposes the 
Group to potential human or labour rights breaches, which 
will only broaden through the energy transition that implies 
new interactions, business relations and infrastructure 
development. Thus, we continue to strengthen our 
approaches to respect human rights, guided by the United 
Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
Third party assurance of suppliers’ and vendors’ requirements 
to uphold human rights, showed some level of awareness, 
but with further work required to uplift human rights 
commitments and delivery of such.

We are also committed to contribute to the well-being 
and development of surrounding communities. In 2022, 
close to RM900 million was invested towards Social Impact 
programmes, benefitting over 1.5 million beneficiaries 
worldwide. Ninety five per cent of the amount invested 
focused on education, including a doubling of scholarships 
to directly benefit 587 students. We have also enhanced 
efforts to increase the marketability of unemployed 
Malaysian graduates through the Graduate Employability 
Enhancement Scheme (GEES), benefitting 4,683 graduates 
with a total contribution of RM73.7 million since the 
inception of the programme.
Transparency in Sustainability Performance and 
Promoting Good Governance
Brand Finance ranked PETRONAS as the most valuable 
ASEAN brand in terms of sustainability perceptions. This 
achievement was undoubtedly helped by our efforts to 
strengthen transparency of our sustainability impacts and 
performance.
As we uphold the principle of accountability and earning 
trust with key stakeholders, we strive to improve both 
internal management reporting of key sustainability 
indicators, as well as external disclosure of our strategies and 
performance in line with recognised international disclosure 
frameworks. 
We have revised our carbon emissions accounting method 
to adhere to sector-specific guidance and to give us a 
robust emissions baseline. Our strengthened reporting 
will improve external benchmarking and provide a better 
correlation between financial and greenhouse gas emissions 
accounting. To this aim, we account for our methane 
emissions, flaring and venting management through the 
publicly available reports issued by the Methane Guiding 
Principles and the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring by 
2030 initiative and report through CDP (formerly Carbon 
Disclosure Project). 
New for this integrated report, is our phased adoption of 
climate-related disclosures as per the recommendations 
of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD). These disclosures will provide greater transparency 
around our approach to climate risk. 
Throughout the year, efforts were underway to drive 
accountability and embed sustainability in advisory bodies 
and decision-making processes across the enterprise. While 
this work is still underway, important milestones include 
board deliberations around the development of the Pathway 
to Net Zero Carbon Emission 2050 and the introduction of 
sustainability-linked key performance indicators in senior 
leadership’s long-term incentive plans. 
Promoting Progress Through Engagement and 
Partnerships
The challenge of achieving net zero carbon emissions is 
too complex for any organisation to deliver on its own. To 
create momentum on the need to accelerate and scale up 
sustainable business models, we have continued to elevate 
our engagement with a broad set of discussion partners 
nationally and internationally.
The Malaysian Oil and Gas Services and Equipment (OGSE) 
ecosystem is facing raised expectations on environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) grounds. In response, the 
Malaysia Petroleum Resource Corporation (MPRC) is 
devising a national OGSE sustainability strategy. PETRONAS 
also works with vendors to identify barriers and help 
define opportunities for greater ESG adoption among local 
businesses. 
Malaysia recently launched a voluntary carbon trading facility 
and has plans to develop a domestic emissions trading 
scheme. These are regarded as important instruments to 
drive the country’s net zero ambitions. In support of this aim, 
PETRONAS has joined the International Emissions Trading 
Association (IETA).
At a regional level, we are active in the APEC Business 
Advisory Council (ABAC). In 2022, we delivered a proposal 
around building Small and Medium Enterprises’ resilience 
in a low-carbon economy. We also joined the International 
Renewable Energy Agency’s Alliance for Industry 
Decarbonisation to foster action for the decarbonisation 
of industrial value chains, promote understanding of 
renewables-based solutions and their adoption by industry 
to contribute to country-specific net zero goals.
With our commitments and 
plans to address climate 
change and nature loss in 
place, next, we will engage 
with stakeholders across 
our value chain to better 
understand what a just and 
equitable energy transition 
may look like and what our 
role should be. 
Letter from the Vice President and 
Chief Sustainability Officer
Furthermore, we are active contributors towards the Global 
Methane Pledge Energy Pathway and other regional and 
global initiatives that address methane emissions in oil 
and gas value chains. In 2022, we signed up to the United 
Nations Environment Programme’s Oil and Gas Methane 
Partnership 2.0. Through this initiative, we strive to improve 
the accuracy and transparency of our methane emissions 
reporting, guided by a comprehensive and measurement-
based reporting framework.
Since 2021, we have convened the ASEAN Energy 
Sector Methane Roundtable, in collaboration with PTT 
Public Company Limited (PTT) of Thailand, Pertamina of 
Indonesia and since last year the United States Agency 
for International Development (USAID). The roundtables 
continue to engage a diverse set of stakeholders from 
across ASEAN through information sharing, technical 
exchange and open conversations, to advance 
strong performance and effective methane emissions 
management.
Outlook
Economic growth across Southeast Asia will put 
decarbonisation and broader sustainability goals to the test. 
Each country and each sector need tailored approaches 
to unlock new business models, without compromising 
broader development. Conducive policy and regulation 
will be critical in defining country-specific pathways and in 
unlocking private sector investment for the next generation 
of energy systems. 
During the year, we stepped up in many ways, from 
setting measurable targets for our Pathway to Net Zero 
Carbon Emission by 2050 to investing in real emissions 
reduction projects, renewables and clean energy solutions. 
PETRONAS’ leading stance on sustainability will not only 
grow the business, but galvanise innovation, investment 
and long-term sustainable growth.
For PETRONAS to succeed at speed and scale we will 
need to work even more intensely across sectors. New 
value chains need to be defined and deployed. Such can 
only be achieved through greater collaboration between 
the private sector, regulators and investors internationally 
to realise the benefits of e.g., carbon capture and storage 
(CCS), hydrogen, biofuels and nature-based solutions fully.
The energy transition is not just a technology and 
investment play, the associated large-scale investments 
is a once in a generation opportunity to strengthen social 
progress and reverse nature loss. As Malaysia’s oil and gas 
resource custodian, we strive for socially inclusive and 
sustainable resource development. 
With our commitments and plans to address climate 
change and nature loss in place, next, we will engage with 
stakeholders across our value chain to better understand 
what a just and equitable energy transition may look like 
and what our role should be. 
The coming year will undoubtedly continue to be volatile. 
As we move forward, we will encounter obstacles in 
advancing sustainability and an equitable energy transition. 
However as demonstrated over recent years, PETRONAS 
remains resilient. Our focus on sustainability and strategic 
priorities coupled with milestone achievements will cement 
our position as a dynamic and reliable partner in the energy 
transition set for long-term success.

PETRONAS Integrated Report 2022
Value We Create
77


The geopolitical conflict in Europe has led to the region 
pivoting away from energy supplied by Russia, which 
previously accounted for about 40 per cent of Europe’s 
natural gas. As a result, energy prices climbed from lows 
seen in the previous two years, prompting players to push 
for higher capacity utilisation to ensure maximum supply 
to meet user demand.
Amid price volatility in both crude oil and natural gas, 
PETRONAS successfully managed challenges by driving 
resilience and operational excellence. Together with 
commercial agility and discipline, we overcame disruptions 
in a more demanding operating environment to deliver a 
strong performance for 2022.
Energy security had become an immediate focus not only 
in Europe but across the world.
Bringing Energy Security to the Fore
For energy players, meeting a surge in demand that came 
amid a re-opening of borders was crucial to ensure 
uninterrupted availability of energy sources to power 
economic recovery. In answering the call for energy 
security, PETRONAS remains steadfast in advancing 
sustainability in our operations and long-term strategy. 
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a vital solution in the 
transition to a net-zero carbon future and we are 
partnering key industry players to deploy CCS while also 
actively reducing methane and flaring.
In 2022, countries participating in the 27th Conference of 
the Parties of the UNFCCC (COP27) in Egypt agreed to 
strengthen and affirm commitments to fight climate 
change despite global headwinds. PETRONAS rose to the 
challenge, granularising our strategy to thrive in energy 
transition and towards realising our Net Zero Carbon 
Emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050) Pathway. Apart from the 
use of CCS, operational excellence is also key to 
achieving this goal, where improved efficiency and fast 
deployment of technology to reduce emissions and lift 
our ability to quickly anticipate and meet market needs.
Gentari, the cleaner energy solutions arm of PETRONAS, 
was launched to accelerate the Group’s push into 
renewable energy, hydrogen and green mobility. These 
will now be part of the portfolio that will catapult 
PETRONAS into playing a leading role in a fast-changing 
energy landscape.
Resilience Through Economic Headwinds
Supply chain disruptions that were still working their way 
through the system meant that costs remained high. In 
the oil and gas sector, cost escalation raised concerns 
that investments today are being channeled to counter 
inflationary pressures when more investments are needed 
to ensure sufficient supply to meet future demand. As an 
energy provider, we will navigate the energy transition in 
a just and responsible manner to deliver energy that 
improves lives and benefits communities across the globe. 
Our strategy towards net zero reflects our drive to 
provide access to cleaner sources of energy, from natural 
gas to hydrogen. We aim to do this through partnerships 
and collaborations that will lift our role in the energy 
sphere.
Across the world, rising inflation has increased pressure 
on central banks to tighten monetary policies, heightening 
concern of a global economic slowdown. The threat of a 
recession appeared just as borders were reopening and 
economic activities were picking up. This added to 
increased volatility in energy markets, which in turn may 
affect investment decisions. Our commitment to ensuring 
energy security remains steadfast and we are committed 
to embedding sustainability in our operations as a 
progressive energy and solutions partner.
Navigating Market Volatility
Oil prices were highly volatile in 2022, marking another 
turbulent year after the pandemic in 2020. After rising 
steadily amid a post-lockdown resurgence in demand, 
crude oil prices spiked to a 14-year high following the 
start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in February. Prices in 
the second half reversed the large gains in the first half of 
2022 as the mounting risk of an imminent slowdown in 
demand gathers over the global economy. This led to 
massive refining capacity closures of around three million 
barrels per day during the pandemic. Meanwhile, the 
Russia-Ukraine conflict had constrained petroleum product 
supply, pushing global refining margins to record levels in 
2022.
Spot LNG prices in Asia hit a record high of USD85/
mmBtu in March 2022 on heightened concern over a 
shortage of supply when Europe scrambled for LNG 
cargoes to make up for Russian piped gas supply. The 
surge in prices resulted in developing nations especially in 
South Asia being starved of affordable fuels while making 
US LNG the biggest winner as Europe sought more 
shipments of the fuel. As energy security concerns 
increased, long-term contracting became favoured again.
The commitment to decarbonise the transport sector intensified further. In the aviation sector, airlines and airports were 
moving towards scaling up sustainable aviation fuel usage, which is mostly bio-based. Governments and sector 
representatives pledged ambitious sustainable aviation fuel blend targets by 2030 to achieve net zero goals by 2050. In 
the shipping sector, countries, ports and shipping companies made more than 40 major announcements on issues such 
as innovations for ships, expansion in low or zero-emission fuels and policies to help promote the uptake of next-
generation zero-emission vessels. The year 2022 kick-started with the ports of Los Angeles and Shanghai announcing 
the world’s first green shipping corridor, followed by five Northern European port authorities’ announcements to serve 
Northern Europe and the Baltic region, as well as the Singapore-Rotterdam route for the longest green shipping 
corridor between Asia and Europe.
Outlook
A prolonged conflict in Europe will lead to continued 
disruptions in oil and gas flows, which means energy 
security remains a key focus for nations. The longer route 
travelled for oil and gas molecules to reach demand 
centres will add to costs and keep energy prices volatile. 
Together with the rising inflation faced by the oil and gas 
sector, this has raised concerns of insufficient spending 
on long-term oil and gas development to meet future 
demand. Global capital expenditure in oil and gas is 
forecasted to rise for a third year in 2023, exceeding 
USD500 billion. This is still some 30 per cent below the 
record USD700 billion that the sector spent in 2014. 
Industry analysts are also concerned that the coming 
year’s capital expenditure (CAPEX) increases will be mostly 
channeled to counter cost inflation and not as much on 
resource finding and development.
Extended Price Volatility
The volatility in the oil market takes place against a 
backdrop of weakening global economic outlook, supply 
disruption from Russia due to European Union sanctions 
and G7 price cap as well as the Organisation of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) alliance output 
cut. OPEC+ aims for market stability and is seen taking 
action to prevent a slowing global economy from sending 
prices down. On the oil refining side, an outlook of an 
economic slowdown, high natural gas prices and a ramp-
up of new greenfield refineries in Asia and the Middle 
East are expected to drag refining margins lower.
Gas and LNG prices may remain above decades-high levels 
for several years as demand for LNG outpaces supply 
growth. The prioritisation of energy security has also 
improved the prospects of low-carbon fuels such as natural 
gas. The leaders of the G7 major economies in June 2022 
conveyed their support for investments in the gas sector 
to reduce dependency on Russian gas while COP27 
supported the development of low-carbon fuels as the 
world seeks to achieve climate goals.
Economic Activities Recover
China’s end to COVID-19 lockdowns is a boost for the 
energy market due to the nation’s ranking as the world’s 
largest oil importer. A recovery in travel and economic 
activities is forecasted to provide support for oil and gas 
prices, even as global GDP slows. Interest rate increases 
are also expected to slow or be paused by central banks 
due to concerns that rate hikes could add to the financial 
turmoil after several bank failures.
Greater Push for Climate Action
While nations and corporations are stepping up to fight 
climate change, the financial sector is also driving action 
through greater scrutiny over investments in energy, 
demanding commitments to decarbonise fossil fuel projects 
and channeling more funds into renewables. Financial 
institutions are looking to strike a balance between 
ensuring sufficient financing for projects that will deliver 
energy security for decades to come and supporting 
renewable energy (RE) developments for clean sources 
of energy. The oil and gas sector is making strides with 
this aim in mind, and in petrochemicals, the evidence is 
seen in the rising number of bio-based projects. Producers 
are pouring funds into research and development 
capabilities and leveraging recycling technologies to lower 
carbon footprints, as well as reduce waste in their push 
towards a circular economy.
Electrification, from the upstream sector to downstream 
petrochemicals, is becoming relevant and prevalent in 
decarbonisation strategies. For hard-to-abate sectors, natural 
gas is a cleaner alternative to provide steam and generate 
the electricity needed. Global leaders are pressuring 
policymakers for more steadfast net-zero policies as current 
climate commitments are insufficient in the fight against 
climate change. Reaching net zero by 2050 requires a 43 
per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 
compared to 2019 levels, despite an International Monetary 
Fund study which estimated that only 11 per cent of the 
emissions will be cut by 2030, based on current commitments.

The World in 2022


At our core, we believe that sustainable business practices demonstrate our commitments to the Company, our 
stakeholders and the planet. By constantly reassessing and revalidating our material topics, we are ensuring that our 
sustainability strategy is informed by the latest data, trends, insights and is responsive to the needs of our stakeholders 
and the environment.
In 2022, we undertook a rigorous reassessment and revalidation of our material topics to ensure that they remain 
relevant and integral to our sustainability strategy and reporting.
Throughout this process, we recognised the significance of the material topics’ impact on our sustainability-related risks 
and opportunities, as well as our impact on society and the planet – a concept known as double materiality. As such, 
we approached our materiality assessment with both an inside-out and outside-in perspective, ensuring that our 
strategy is fully aligned with the needs of our stakeholders and the environment.
To achieve this, we utilised a data-driven tool to conduct an assessment of our material topics, covering both financial 
materiality and impact materiality. This allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the implications of our material 
topics on our business, society and the planet.
As we move forward, we remain committed to improving our double materiality assessment process by embedding 
monitoring and risk elements on a continuous basis. This will ensure that our assessment is sufficiently holistic and 
robust in guiding our company’s sustainability priorities. In addition, we have expanded our horizontal scanning analysis 
to include new sources, allowing us to identify any potential blind spots in our existing topics.

Identification
We looked at new sources, including existing 
and emerging regulations, media and the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 
Standards, to identify pertinent trends in the 
sustainability landscape. SASB proved to be 
especially valuable in preparing for the 
upcoming International Sustainability Standards 
Board (ISSB) standards, given that ISSB has 
committed to building on and embedding the 
SASB Standards within its own.
Stakeholder Engagement
We gained in-depth feedback from external 
stakeholders, including investors, banks and 
rating agencies, to evaluate the material 
topics’ impact on our business. The 
Reputation Strength Index survey, which was 
conducted throughout the year, provided 
valuable insights that helped guide our 
materiality assessment. We documented 
stakeholders’ concerns, queries and 
responses as inputs for the assessment.
Prioritisation
We prioritised our strategies and focus 
areas through initiatives and 
commitments, as well as discussions 
held at the Executive Leadership Team 
and Board level. Our material topics 
were also ranked based on their 
alignment with the risk elements in 
PETRONAS Corporate Risk Profile.
Endorsement
We submitted the results of our 
revalidation process to the 
Sustainability Committee (formerly 
known as Sustainability Council), 
which was then approved by the 
Vice President and Chief 
Sustainability Officer.

2. 
Movement of Material Topics
As we move towards post COVID-19 recovery, we have noticed a shift in priorities for our material topics, with 
Health and Well-being decreasing in importance. However, it remains as a priority as we continue to focus on the 
physical and mental well-being of our employees and surrounding communities.
One of the topics that has gained importance in our materiality assessment is GHG emissions. We have set 
ambitious targets to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and reducing our GHG emissions is a critical 
component of this goal. 
Another topic that has gained significance is lower carbon and energy transition business. We recognise that the 
world is transitioning towards cleaner energy sources and we are committed to playing our part in this transition.
3. 
Double Materiality 
Through our double materiality approach, we consider both the financial and sustainability impact of our material 
topics. This approach allows us to understand the financial implications of sustainability risks and opportunities and 
how they may impact our long-term financial performance.
In our assessments, we found that GHG emissions is the most relevant of all our material topics in both financial 
and sustainability impact perspectives. This highlights the critical role that reducing our carbon footprint plays in 
achieving our sustainability goals and maintaining financial stability. Other material topics that are also significant in 
both perspectives include energy transition business, climate change risks and management and safety 
management.
4. 
Areas for Improvement
By including new sources in our identification process, we noticed additional areas which were not covered in our 
existing material topics. However, these were topics that are already embedded in our enterprise risk management 
and portfolio management, including but not limited to business resilience and continuity in the face of potential 
catastrophic events; energy security and affordability; cybersecurity and information security; corporate’s core 
values and guiding principles; and shifting demographics. As part of continuous improvement, we have included 
these as points of consideration, as we continue to explore better ways of integrating ESG factors into PETRONAS’ 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process directly.

Environmental Management
An inability to conserve and protect nature and biodiversity may impact our ability to deliver on our business goals and NZCE 
2050 Pathway. As climate change is significantly driving biodiversity loss and may cause irreversible damage, we aim to further 
understand our relationship and dependency on nature in order to improve oversight of our nature and biodiversity footprint.
Protecting and conserving the environment will minimise the impact of our operations on the environment, given our role as an 
environmental steward. This will also ensure the long-term health of our business and the communities around us. We identify 
and assess the environmental impact of our operations and focus on managing our resources sustainably. This includes, but is 
not limited to, decreasing the impact of emissions, creating responsible waste and water management strategies, preventing spills 
and decommissioning our assets in a safe and sustainable manner.
Safety Management
Managing the safety of our people continues to remain a top priority as this ensures we protect our employees and contractors 
from any harm or injuries. In striving towards operational excellence, we conduct proactive risk management practices across our 
business and operations to provide the safest possible work conditions while ensuring our assets are continuously well 
maintained. 
Climate Change Risks
Our aim is to strengthen PETRONAS’ resilience to physical and transition climate change risks, while seizing the opportunities 
presented in the transition to a lower-carbon economy. We are actively looking into adaptation and resilience measures, as well 
as the relevant governance systems to manage climate-related risks and opportunities, as per the recommendations of the Task 
Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

To create sustainable value, we implement a comprehensive risk management and internal control system that mitigates 
significant risks. This system is fundamental to delivering long-term stakeholder value as it identifies, assesses, manages 
and monitors a range of financial and non-financial risks. It is not intended to eliminate risk entirely, but instead to 
manage our risk exposure across our businesses, while at the same time making the most of any opportunities. This 
system provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Setting the tone from the top and driving our risk management and internal control system is the PETRONAS Board 
(Board) and its sub-committees, namely the Risk Committee (RC) and Audit Committee (AC), as well as the Executive 
Leadership Team (ELT). In addition to the above committees, the Risk Management Committee (RMC) and respective 
Risk Management functions support the risk oversight.
Risk Management Committee (RMC)
RMC serves as a central platform to support 
PETRONAS’ Management and the Board in managing 
risks and maintaining acceptable levels of risks as well 
as providing guidance and advisory on Groupwide risk 
management system and its implementation.

The Way We Manage Risks
PETRONAS Risk Policy outlines the general principles and guidelines for making risk-based decisions. Through this 
policy, we continuously strive to implement risk management best practices to protect and create value. It ensures a 
balanced and holistic view of exposures to achieve business objectives, thus strengthening our position as a risk-
resilient organisation. Complementing this policy is the PETRONAS Resiliency Model, which provides an integrated and 
holistic view of the overall strategy for more effective risk management. It focuses on three areas of business resilience, 
namely Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), Crisis Management (CM) and Business Continuity Management (BCM).

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is integral to managing the business. It acts as a guide to systematically 
identify, assess, treat, monitor and review risks, as outlined in our ERM process. It aims to improve our ability to 
reduce the likelihood and/or impact of risks that may affect the achievement of our business objectives.
Through the ERM process, risk profiles are established, together with the corresponding risk mitigations and key risk 
indicators, all of which are monitored at the corporate level and by the respective units across PETRONAS Group.
PETRONAS Risk Appetite articulates the type of risks we are willing to accept to guide strategic decisions at the 
corporate level. It reflects our position, propensity and acceptability to take risks in various areas, namely strategic, 
financial, operational and reputational while adhering to legal and regulatory compliance. The risk appetite for each 
area is determined by its respective tolerance and threshold levels.
At the corporate level, the PETRONAS Corporate Risk Profile and Risk Appetite are monitored and reported 
quarterly to the RMC, ELT, RC and the Board. 
Risk assessments are conducted at key decision points to:
• Ensure decisions that significantly impact our business operations and strategies are made through consideration 
of risk-reward trade-off; and 
• Create risk-reward conversations at respective decision platforms and/or approving authority.
Crisis Management (CM) is an integrated process that aims to prepare our domestic and international operations 
to respond to and manage crises in risk areas, to protect the People, Environment, Assets and Reputation (PEAR). 
Under CM, we adopt a three-tiered response protocol that demarcates the roles and responsibilities of the emergency 
site management, operating unit management, corporate and internal or external response agencies and/or authorities. 
We also conduct Testing and Exercising (T&E) via simulation of test scenarios to ensure the effectiveness of response 
strategies and promote continuous improvement, as identified in the Emergency or Crisis Management Plan.
Business Continuity Management (BCM) aims to build our capabilities to recover and continuously deliver 
products or services at acceptable, predefined levels following any prolonged disruption. The Business Continuity 
Plan (BCP) is key to this framework, which enhances our preparedness to recover and restore business-critical 
functions within a reasonable period, sustain activities and minimise disruptions to stakeholders. Through 
simulation of test scenarios, we also conduct T&E to validate the effectiveness of recovery strategies as well as 
maintain a high level of competence and readiness as identified in the BCP.

Managing Our Principal Risks 
Our ability to create long-term value is subject to several factors, including those beyond our control. Whether known 
or unknown, these and other risks may present threats that could adversely impact our operations and our 
stakeholders. Nevertheless, they may also present opportunities that can be leveraged for strategic benefit to pursue 
growth opportunities and build the right capabilities for business sustainability. The principal risks are set out below 
together with the key mitigation measures to manage them. This list is not exhaustive and the order in which we 
outline these risks does not necessarily reflect the likelihood of occurrence or magnitude of their impact.
In 2022, Sustainability Risk is included as one of the principal risks to reflect the significance of managing 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) related exposures including climate change risk to the business strategies 
for long term growth. Given the exposures climate change risk present to PETRONAS’ business operations and 
strategies, it has been considered as input to some of the principal risks.
In addition, the Risk Management in Action section features our focused efforts in effectively managing selected 
principal risks against the backdrop of a dynamic and uncertain operating environment. 
We are strengthening our risk management efforts and related disclosures to ensure consistency with global 
sustainability frameworks and standards. Aligning our disclosures with the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) is in progress and can be accessed in the Safeguard the Environment section. Work is also ongoing 
to ensure alignment of our disclosure with the World Economic Forum’s Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics.

Risks Linked to Creating Value


Impact on Value
Impact on Value
• The geopolitical situation, particularly the Russia-Ukraine war and the prolonged impact of COVID-19 have influenced the fluctuation of 
commodity prices and customers’ demand leading to implications on areas such as our project viability, financial performance and 
returns to shareholders.
• It also impacts the ability of our counterparties such as vendors, partners and contractors to fulfil their contractual obligations to the 
Group as commercial arrangements are pegged to commodity prices. Consequently, this could impede our growth prospects and have a 
long-term impact on the sustainability of our business operations.
• Meanwhile, changes in customer preferences brought about by the energy transition result in increased competition in the energy 
industry, indirectly affecting our value chain.
• Fluctuations in exchange rate stemming from our global operations and the difference between reporting currency in Ringgit Malaysia 
and transactions that are dealt in US Dollar may lead to increased cost of operations and revenue erosion.
Impact on Capitals
Impact on Capitals
Financial Capital: 
External uncertainties resulting from changes in market conditions can undermine our capacity to realise consistent returns and may impact 
the Group’s capability to sustain business operations and pursue growth.
Manufactured Capital: 
Identifying assets that form the core engine to support current and future operating models may also be at risk of changing market 
demands and external regulations.
Intellectual and Human Capitals:
Existing intellectual capital required to support the business can be made redundant in the face of rapid changes in technology and the 
market environment.
Natural Capital: 
Prospective oil and gas investments and efforts to prolong existing assets and economic life of reserves may become uneconomical should 
there be changes in the market environment and outlook.
Market Risk
What It Means
The Group’s financial performance is exposed to risks caused by the volatility of commodity prices, changes in customer demand and 
fluctuation of the exchange rate, influenced by factors such as macroeconomy, geopolitics, supply demand balance as well as the 
lingering effects of COVID-19. 
Additionally, the energy transition driven by climate change will impact customers’ preferences as demand for renewable energy and 
more sustainably sourced products gain prominence, thus, increasing pressure on us to diversify into new areas beyond our core 
business.

Mitigation Strategies
Mitigation Strategies
1. Undertake regular reviews of strategies, prioritise resources to 
areas of the highest importance for the organisation and 
conduct rigorous efforts to secure new demand within the core 
and new business in response to the wide-ranging market risks 
and the corresponding challenges in generating value from our 
business.
2. Undertake regular monitoring and review of our portfolio 
composition and counterparty performance to identify critical 
issues and specific interventions to limit the exposure to 
PETRONAS, for example securing new demand aligned to the 
strategic thrusts, business diversification requirements and 
identified building blocks to realise NZCE 2050 targets.
3. Manage market risk exposures namely commodity price and 
foreign exchange exposure through hedging activities to protect 
value and margins.
4. Implement prudent financial governance through PETRONAS 
Financial Policy (PFP), supported by the PETRONAS Financial 
Standards (PFS) which outlines the principles and requirements 
that promote effective implementation of financial management 
including financial risk management practices to ensure financial 
resilience over the long term. PETRONAS Financial Risk Appetite 
was implemented across the Group with specific financial 
thresholds to ensure that business decisions are undertaken 
within the approved thresholds.
5. Ensure continuous engagements with targeted stakeholders to 
advocate our business strategies and instil awareness, ensure 
buy-ins and obtain support from the relevant stakeholders.

Concerns regarding the supply security following the Russia-Ukraine war underpins the global oil price volatility, adding further pressure to 
an already tightening crude market with OPEC+ producing lower than planned. Upward price momentum is also partially tempered by 
China’s continued Zero-COVID policy, global recession fears and strong US dollar. These concerns led to increased exposures on market 
risk and are managed through the approved mechanism and risk appetite.
Opportunities
Opportunities
1. Defined strategic direction coupled with price volatility and changes in customer demand have steered PETRONAS to accelerate 
diversification of our energy mix to timely capture new market opportunities, including establishment of Gentari as our clean energy 
solutions entity.
2.  The uncertain geopolitical situation provides opportunities to enter new markets, explore new supply bases and establish new 
partnerships across the supply chain.
3. The volatile commodity market provides opportunities for PETRONAS to actively pursue trading opportunities and provide additional 
value by capturing pockets of favorable volatility. Furthermore, heightened ESG awareness provides an opportunity for the inclusion of 
ESG-linked products in hedging and trading activities in line with the Global Energy Market’s trajectory towards sustainability.
4. Accelerating the utilisation of digital tools and technology, enhancing trading and supply chain models, as well as pursuing cost 
management tools enable us to counter the short term impact of volatility.

objectives and support the Group’s business growth. Review and 
monitor our liquidity position regularly aligned to the risk appetite 
established for liquidity and indebtedness levels.
2. Execute the following to manage Liquidity Risk, similar to 
managing Market Risk:
• 
The PFP and PFS guide us to ensure that adequate financial 
management and risk management practices are 
implemented.
• 
The Portfolio Commodity Hedging Programme protects value 
and margin against adverse price movement.
3. Establish a Liquidity Risk Contingency Protocol (LRCP) which will 
act as a liquidity crisis management plan to ensure PETRONAS’ 
responsiveness in safeguarding the Group’s financial 
sustainability. 
4. Establish a trust fund (Decarbonisation Fund) and continuous 
contribution to safeguard the availability of funds for its intended 
utilisation for decarbonisation and clean energy in achieving NZCE 
2050 targets.
5. Engage key stakeholders regularly, including banks, current and 
potential investors and counterparties to ensure the readiness for 
external funding and borrowing including ESG related funding, 
should it be required. Where needed, conduct ongoing 
assessments on credit position and review of counterparties to 
ensure their creditworthiness in fulfilling their financial obligations.

Hydrocarbon reserves and resources indicators remain stable with the proactive interventions and mitigations focusing on ensuring 
effective management of reserves and resources to meet commitments to our stakeholders.
Hydrocarbon Reserves and Resources Risk
What It Means
Our ability to supply oil and gas depends on finding and managing sufficient reserves and resources to meet our commitments to 
stakeholders. This will depend on exploration success, project maturation, reservoir or field performance, asset acquisition or 
relinquishment and commercial factors. 
However, our exploration activities face uncertainties like technical challenges and limited information. Meanwhile, fields already in 
production also face challenges like declining pressure and equipment reliability issues. Changes in government policies can also affect 
the value of our assets.

Risk Management in Action 
PETRONAS’ Post-Pandemic Recovery Efforts
Globally, 2022 saw a period of continued recovery from the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Combined with 
geopolitical uncertainties, global demand and supply were negatively impacted leading to a high-cost and high-price 
environment. A shortage of raw materials and services as well as increased demand consequently led to competition for 
these limited resources. 
From a human capital perspective, the global workforce evolved rapidly post-pandemic and demand for flexibility in the 
work environment was heightened. The pandemic disrupted the organisation’s usual way of working and accelerated 
ongoing evolutions such as telework and digitalisation.
As part of our post-pandemic recovery efforts, we focused on managing the implications of supply chain disruptions 
and facilitating our workforce to adapt to the new way of working.
1. Managing global supply chain disruptions
The oil and gas industry faced a limited supply of key resources leading to competition for resources such as marine 
vessels, fabrication yards, drilling rigs and skilled talents. Combined with the scarcity of vendors in the market as well 
as financial challenges faced by some vendors, these factors may adversely impact the pace and cost of project 
delivery for PETRONAS.
In managing the associated implications, we closely monitored the progress of project delivery to enable relevant 
intervention on project cost and schedule to be undertaken in a timely manner, while ensuring project compliance 
with internal standards and requirements in delivering project quality. These efforts culminated in projects delivered 
according to On Time, On Budget, On Scope (OTOBOS) while some were completed ahead of schedule, ultimately 
delivering value to PETRONAS through cost reduction, operational efficiency and cash generation. 
In addition, targeted efforts to strengthen supply chain resiliency, focusing on vendor and contract management have 
been implemented. These efforts include establishing strategic collaborations with government bodies and other industry 
players in shaping the Oil and Gas Services and Equipment (OGSE) industry. We extended support to vendors by 
enhancing capacity and capability development as well as facilitating access to financing from Malaysian financial 
institutions. We also identified alternative reliable supply points to diversify access to key materials and services. Lastly, we 
also developed innovative contracting strategies to enhance contract efficiency and promote a competitive market.
2. Adapting to a new way of working
The pandemic has challenged and transformed the idea of a conventional workplace and hybrid working has become the 
new norm. While we continued to deliver business targets and preserved operational efficiency during these extraordinary 
circumstances, some employees have struggled to adapt, leading to a deterioration in employees’ mental well-being.
In addressing this, key initiatives were introduced, such as the Flexible Working Arrangement (FlexiWork) to support 
work-life balance for employees to manage their professional and personal commitments, empowering them to 
achieve productivity and continue delivering for the organisation. 
We also strengthened the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) 2.0 by extending its benefits to employees’ direct 
family members as a proactive measure to address mental health concerns among our employees, as we recognise 
family members as their strongest support system. 
The pandemic has also accelerated the adoption of digital technologies and PETRONAS has adapted. The increased 
reliance on digital technologies as part of the new way of working has expanded the digital footprint. This expansion, 
coupled with the evolution of digital threats has increased our exposure to cyberattacks.
In response, we focused on establishing specific key cybersecurity capabilities to ensure employees can work safely 
and securely, regardless of location or device they are working from. 
On top of the requisite security governance, infrastructure, processes and cyber defensive capability, we ramped up 
efforts to strengthen security of Internet access and device, with around-the-clock support from the Security 
Operations Centre. We increased communication and awareness activities around behaviours of working remotely in a 
secure manner, keeping staff updated with the latest threats. These efforts were key in supporting both organisational 
and employee resilience in the face of new emerging threats, resulting from technological and digital shifts across the 
business and in adapting to the hybrid working arrangement as a new norm.

PETRONAS Energy Transition Strategy
Energy transition is happening and is gaining momentum.
The energy transition journey is not linear given many moving parts – evolving policies 
and regulations, changing customer preferences for low-carbon energy solutions and 
increasing expectations of investors and financiers.
PETRONAS as a leading global energy company aims to play a key role in the energy 
transition, focusing on energy security and at the same time delivering energy solutions 
responsibly.
We have developed our Energy Transition Strategy centred on creating value for our 
customers and stakeholders. Our Energy Transition Strategy will steer PETRONAS to 
strengthen our Core Business, capture new growth opportunities for New Business and at 
the same time responsibly manage carbon emissions to realise our NZCE 2050 Pathway.
Our priority is to strike the right balance between growth in our Core Business and New 
Business while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in order to thrive in the energy 
transition. We will allocate our capital resources with discipline and nurture a strong 
talent bench to deliver this strategy.
We will remain resolutely progressive to ensure a sustainable future.
The world needs more energy to support a growing 
population and economic expansion, but this demand must be 
met with reduced emissions for a sustainable future.
Oil and gas will continue to be relevant in the energy mix until 
2050, with gas playing a major role as a transition fuel, given 
growing demand for gas to fulfil global energy security needs.
PETRONAS is in an advantageous position in this energy 
transition as two-thirds of its hydrocarbon portfolio is made 
up of gas. PETRONAS will continue to serve global LNG 
demand as one of the leading LNG players in the world.
PETRONAS’ efforts to strengthen its Core Business will help 
sustain the vibrancy of the oil and gas integrated value chain, 
local Oil and Gas Services and Equipment (OGSE) ecosystem 
and adjacent industries.
Our Core Business continues to be an anchor for PETRONAS 
as it is expected to generate steady cashflows to help finance 
our decarbonisation efforts and investments in new businesses.
We will produce oil and gas in a differentiated manner, safely, 
reliably, with focus on reducing carbon emissions and at a 
competitive cost.
We will continue to strengthen our Downstream assets to 
capitalise on the favourable commodities outlook and expand 
product offerings with a focus on customer-centricity.

Executive Officer, Upstream
In 2022, the world leaned on oil and gas to meet its energy needs in 
light of the geopolitical turmoil. This led to record high energy prices 
and an uptick in upstream activities against the backdrop of increased 
costs. And the industry responded, delivering the energy security needed 
in a sustainable manner.
A renewed focus on the home front rendered a string of successful 
exploration discoveries which grew Malaysia’s resource base. We also 
sanctioned a slew of projects and activities to continue safeguarding the 
country’s energy security and guaranteeing the vibrancy of its oil and gas 
industry. Internationally, the reshaping of our portfolio is ongoing 
through growth in some of the world’s most prolific basins. We also 
undertook a series of high-grading efforts, driven by a relentless focus 
on value and delivering differentiated barrels.
Finally, we made great strides in decarbonisation and carbon capture and

As at 1 January 2023, PETRONAS’ total petroleum 2P reserves stood at 9.25 Bboe, an increase of two per cent 
from 2021. The improvement in reserves performance is primarily due to the healthy maturation of contingent 
resources to reserves. PETRONAS' total contingent resources (2C) stood at 15.50 Bboe, an increase of one per

• We expect the market to remain challenging this year. The ongoing geopolitical tension in Europe continues to 
influence economic development and trade as we cope with high inflation and increasing interest rate environment. 
•  Closer to our industry, the strengthening of regulations in relation to emissions will require a radical approach and 
closer collaboration by the industry players to ensure compliance. 
•  Notwithstanding the continued challenging outlook, 2023 is filled with opportunities for MISC. We see ourselves 
shifting gears both in terms of the execution of current projects and advancement towards achieving our 2050 
objectives whilst being selective on strategic client positioning, strong recurring cash flows and cleaner energy 
solutions.

Sustainability at PETRONAS
Sustainability Governance
Our commitment to sustainability starts at the core of our operations and extends throughout our value chain. We 
understand that countries face an energy trilemma, with security, affordability and sustainability concerns that require a 
unique spectrum of solutions. Therefore, a collective approach among governments, energy players, public and private 
sectors is necessary. By working together, we can leverage each other’s strengths to achieve a sustainable, low-carbon 
future in a just and responsible manner.
To ensure accountability and integrity, we have established a dedicated governance structure with clear reporting lines 
that drives our sustainability strategies, action plans, and initiatives. This structure ensures that our sustainability 
principles and priorities are fully integrated across the organisation, embedded in decision-making and execution of our 
sustainability-related matters. With this structure, we delineate roles and responsibilities clearly, enabling effective 
oversight, decision-making and efficient execution.

Memberships and Associations
As we move forward in supporting the global agenda, we believe that building relationships through trust and 
respect is crucial. We continuously explore and actively participate in professional associations, events, and 
memberships to strengthen our sustainability efforts, aligned with our strategic direction and Net Zero Carbon 
Emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050) Pathway. Through our participation and engagements, we are able to better 
understand the concerns that need to be addressed and identify ways in which we could do to help. Our aim is 
to contribute to the nation-building of Malaysia and create a positive impact across industries and society.
In 2022, we further demonstrated our commitment to the industry through three additional involvements. We 
became a member of the Energy Transitions Commission where we aim to strengthen our leadership role in 
championing the energy transition agenda in Malaysia as well as in the ASEAN region.
We also affirmed our methane commitments by joining United Nation’s Environment Programmme (UNEP) Oil and 
Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP2.0) Framework. It is a comprehensive, measurement-based reporting 
framework that improves the accuracy and transparency of methane emissions reporting in the energy sector.
We also joined the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)’s Alliance for Industry Decarbonisation 
alongside other global companies across industrial sectors. The Alliance aims to contribute to the achievement of 
country-specific net-zero goals, foster action for decarbonisation of industrial value chains and enhance 
understanding of renewables-based solutions and their adoption by industry.

Sustainability Statement


Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions
Why Is It Important? 
Climate science plays a significant role in driving the 
transition to renewable energy sources and low-carbon 
technologies. As awareness of the need to mitigate 
climate change grows, there is increasing demand for 
cleaner, sustainable energy. This shift creates both risks 
and opportunities for PETRONAS.
We risk being left behind as the world transitions to a 
low-carbon economy, leading to stranded assets, lost 
revenue streams and reputational damage. However, we 
see opportunity to lead in the energy transition, leveraging 
our legacy, expertise and resources to develop greener 
technologies and business models.
What Is Our Approach?
PETRONAS is dedicated to our role as custodian of 
Malaysia’s hydrocarbon resources and to meet customer 
energy demands, while contributing towards the climate 
ambitions of the Paris Agreement. Our NZCE 2050 
Pathway was launched in November 2022, outlining the 
actions needed to achieve our net-zero ambitions. The 
development of the NZCE 2050 Pathway was informed by 
our business context, national policies, international 
frameworks, and scientific consensus on climate change.
In driving a focused delivery of the NZCE 2050 Pathway, 
20 per cent of total capital expenditure will be allocated 
for decarbonisation projects and expansion into cleaner 
energy solutions from 2022 to 2026. We will also track 
our GHG emissions to ensure we are on the right 
trajectory to meet the targets.
We aspire to proactively strengthen transparency in 
reporting while shaping the national climate-related risk 
disclosure practice in Malaysia. We have commenced to 
apply the framework recommendations put forward by the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
to our assessment of climate risk. By aligning our strategic 
assessment of risk with TCFD, we strive to effectively 
manage and capitalise on climate-related risks and 
opportunities and accelerate progress towards our path to 
net zero.
Safeguard the 
Environment
We continue to accelerate our climate actions to 
realise our Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 
(NZCE 2050) Pathway. Throughout 2022, we ramped-
up our efforts to advance our performance. With a 
resolute focus on driving progress, we will continue 
bridging the emissions gap and work with 
stakeholders to embrace the changes on the path to 
net zero.
Aligned to:
1 
Governance 
We recognise that climate change is a critical business issue, contributing to a set of risks and opportunities. We are 
taking more deliberate actions to elevate sustainability, especially climate-related discussions at the Board, to shape the 
long-term strategic direction of the company.
[The role of the Board in climate-related matters can be referred to in the Sustainability Statement section on page 155]
2 
Addressing Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities 
In November 2022, we defined our NZCE 2050 to accelerate and advance groupwide actions and commitment. The 
NZCE 2050 Pathway – with its short-, medium- and long term targets – will steer the group towards realising our 
ambitions.
The Pathway is two-pronged, reducing operational GHG emissions and increasing investments in business growth 
opportunities in the low carbon economy. PETRONAS will implement activities through four main decarbonisation levers 
– zero routine flaring and venting, energy efficiency, electrification and carbon capture and storage (CCS) – to reduce 
operational emissions as far as possible and offset remaining hard-to-abate emissions with nature-based climate 
solutions.

Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities
Risk management accountability and oversight is an 
integral part of our governance including Climate Change 
governance. The Board reviews and considers our 
principal risks in the PETRONAS Corporate Risk Profile, 
covering operational and strategic risks based on periodic 
updates. The updates include an overview of the principal 
risks, a summary of material changes, as well as updates 
on mitigations and performance against key indicators. 
The Risk Management Committee, Executive Leadership 
Team (ELT) and Risk Committee assist the Board with the 
oversight of risk management including environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) and climate-related risk 
management.
 
[Further details on risk governance can be referred to in the Risks 
Linked to Creating Values section on page 86]
We apply a groupwide approach to the management of 
risk through the establishment of the PETRONAS Risk 
Policy and complemented by the PETRONAS Resiliency 
Model, which the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
Framework is part of. These policies and frameworks 
provide an integrated and holistic view of the overall 
strategy towards effective risk management.
[Details of PETRONAS Resiliency Model can be referred to in the Risks 
Linked to Creating Value section on page 87]
 
Our ERM includes requirements and guidance on the tools 
and processes involved to systematically identify, assess, 
evaluate, manage, report and monitor all types of risks. 
The ERM process requires a thorough assessment of 
entities and functional risks, including climate-related risks. 
It also includes an impact and likelihood assessment, 
which supports consideration of the relative significance of 
risks. Principal risks are identified and approved by 
management as pertinent risks to the entity and requires 
close monitoring. 
 
[Details of Sustainability Risk and other principal risks can be referred 
to in the Risks Linked to Creating Value section on page 90]

Recognising the exposure of climate-related risks to our 
business operations and strategies, the impact of climate 
change has been taken into consideration and reflected in 
the development of relevant principal risks such as 
Sustainability Risks, Financial Liquidity Risk, Market Risk and 
Legal and Regulatory Risks. We are also strengthening our 
climate-related risk management efforts and corresponding 
disclosures to ensure they align with global sustainability 
frameworks and standards. Our efforts are positioned to 
align with the TCFD recommendations and the World 
Economic Forum’s Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics.
 
We have been actively addressing climate change for 
almost a decade with our Climate Change Position and 
Framework which is the impetus of our climate change 
risk assessments that have been conducted since 2015. 
However, increasing stakeholders’ expectations towards 
energy companies to align the climate risk assessment 
with global sustainability standards and frameworks has led 
us to progressively review and enhance our climate-
related risk assessment approach.
We have adopted TCFD’s categorisation of climate-related 
risks into two major categories which are transition risks 
and physical risks.

Transition Risks
Transition risks refer to potential risks arising from the 
global shift towards a more sustainable, net-zero 
economy, which encompasses policy, regulatory, market 
and technological changes that could impact our business 
operations.
One of the transition risks identified is the impact of oil 
and gas pricing or margins, which may reduce commercial
returns stemming from the change in consumer 
preferences, regulatory pressure and/or our approach to
sustainability. This in turn may result in diminished 
revenue, cash generation and returns realisation.
 
International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios provide oil and 
gas prices, which are built on underlying assumptions of 
socio-economic growth and climate policies and 
commitments’ development. For instance, oil prices are 
expected to be the lowest in the Net Zero Emissions by 
2050 Scenario (NZE), due to reduced demand for oil. This 
would have a material impact on our upstream business. 
We also recognise carbon pricing as a means of driving 
emissions reduction across economic activities. Carbon 
pricing is used to assess our potential cost impact based 
on the different climate scenarios. 
Furthermore, the energy transition calls for better 
disclosures and enhanced transparency given the impact 
of significant climate-related issues or risks to our 
financials. Our inability to respond at pace will lead to 
reduced access to capital, inflated capital cost and limited 
investment types. In addition, a downgrade of our ESG 
score may lead to higher borrowing costs, which further 
limits capacity to access capital markets.
Strategic measures to manage the implication of transition 
risks to our organisation are highlighted in the Our 
Approach to Climate-related Risks and Opportunities 
section. These measures are aligned with the mitigations 
and Key Risks Indicators of the identified principal risks in 
the PETRONAS Corporate Risk Profile, which are 
Sustainability Risk, Financial Liquidity Risk, Market Risk, and 
Legal and Regulatory Risk in the Risks Linked to Creating 
Value section.

risks by our businesses can be referred to in the Business Review 
section]
Risks and Opportunities Quantification on Financial Performance
We have identified certain risks and opportunities to our business based on the three International Energy Agency (IEA) 
scenarios – Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), and Net Zero Emissions by 2050 
Scenario (NZE). The scenarios were chosen based on their breadth that consider the world’s different states based on 
energy makeup and carbon dioxide emission levels. They present three climate pathways, with temperature rise ranging 
from below 2°C to 2.7°C by 2100, providing granular and regional data breakdown. 
The time horizons used were short term (2024), medium term (2030) and long term (2050). Identified risks relate to 
how oil, gas and carbon prices will impact PETRONAS Group EBITDA*, based on analysis for Upstream, Gas and 
Downstream businesses for FY2030. We have identified opportunities in renewable energy, hydrogen and green mobility 
based on their impact on our EBITDA for the New Energy business for FY2030. The chosen scenarios and the 
corresponding climate outcomes are summarised as below:

assume future strengthening – or 
weakening – of future policy action, 
except where there already is 
specific evidence to the contrary.

Physical Risks
Physical risks resulting from climate change can be in the 
form of acute risks due to one-time events or chronic 
risks due to longer-term changes in climate patterns such 
as rise in sea levels and average global temperature, water 
shortages, and intense precipitation. Our physical assets 
and ongoing projects are exposed to physical risks as we 
have presence in more than 30 countries globally. Thus, 
we are not and will not be spared from the direct and 
indirect damages brought about by the impact of physical 
climate-related risks.
While actions are ongoing to manage physical risks, we 
continuously re-assess implications, taking into 
consideration the changing outlook for geographical 
locations where we are present. The re-assessment 
outcome serves as an imperative to strengthen our 
existing mitigation strategy in ensuring robustness and 
sustainability of our organisation moving forward.
Taking into account these factors, we will continue to 
pursue a deliberate energy transition strategy, balancing 
Core Business and New Business with our NZCE 2050 
Pathway aligning with changing customer preferences, 
evolving regulations and increasing expectations by 
stakeholders for low-carbon energy solutions.

Metrics and Targets
We have revised our carbon emissions accounting method to adhere to international frameworks and sector specific 
guidance to give us a robust basis for Scope 1 and Scope 2, and a better understanding of Scope 3 GHG emissions. 
The financial year 2022 marks the beginning of disclosures of GHG emissions through both operational control and 
equity share approaches. 
In charting our NZCE 2050 Pathway, PETRONAS has adopted the equity share approach to account for our emissions 
inventory and performance against mid- and long-term milestone targets, with 2019 as the base year.
Our 2024 short-term GHG emissions target and all methane emissions reduction targets are based on the operational 
control approach. This allows us to track performance of all assets under our control and to drive immediate climate 
actions for direct and effective change.
The equity share approach will guide our assets and investments to be in line with our Pathway and be reflected in our 
annual integrated report. This methodology allows for business’ long-term energy transition pathway development and 
portfolio transition tracking.
As a result of our enhanced emissions accounting practices, which includes a change in organisational boundary, we 
have adjusted our 2019 baseline reference to 54.87 Million tCO2e via equity share approach.
The Pathway has short-term and mid-term targets focusing on absolute GHG and methane emissions. The short-term 
target is to cap Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to 49.5 Million tCO2e by 2024 for PETRONAS operated assets in 
Malaysia.
We have set a mid-term target to reduce 25 per cent GHG emissions for Scope 1 and Scope 2 under equity share 
approach by the year 2030.
A key area of our net-zero efforts is to reduce methane emissions. Methane is a primary component of natural gas and 
a more potent GHG than carbon dioxide. Thus, we have specified targets for methane emissions reduction as part of 
our broader GHG targets.
The target is to reduce methane emission groupwide by 50 per cent by 2025 and by 70 per cent by 2030. Additionally, 
we are committed to drive down methane emissions beyond PETRONAS’ own operations within our industry. To this 
aim, we have established a 50 per cent methane emissions reduction target for Malaysia’s natural gas value chain by 
2030. The methane emissions reduction targets will support Malaysia’s commitment to the Global Methane Pledge of 
reducing national methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030.
Moving forward, PETRONAS is updating internal standards and procedures, and building capabilities in GHG and 
methane emissions management. Commencing in 2023, PETRONAS will commission third party assurance of Scope 1 
and Scope 2 GHG emissions.

2022 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Management
As part of the embedment process and to ensure 
sustainable GHG management practice across PETRONAS 
operations, several initiatives were undertaken during 2022:
1 
Enhancement of GHG Management System
Following the mainstreaming of GHG Management as part 
of PETRONAS HSE Mandatory Control Framework (MCF) in 
January 2022, PETRONAS has conducted four internal 
assurance activities – second line assurance and internal 
reviews – based on a risk-based approach. This activity 
helped to identify key gaps and enablers to improve GHG 
accounting and reporting.
2 
GHG Digital Tools
PETRONAS has improved and automated the quantification 
of Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions in Gas business 
by linking activity data from plant information systems to 
the calculation tool, eliminating the need for human 
intervention in the process.
3 
GHG Capability
PETRONAS has identified GHG Management as a crucial 
skill set to be developed as an enabler to realise our 
NZCE 2050 Pathway. A new discipline has been 
established under the HSE skill group with a set of 
competency requirements, recommended trainings and 
required resources across corporate and business 
functions.
4 
Physical Impacts of Climate Change
A vulnerability assessment was conducted on PETRONAS’ 
assets covering 1,140 locations in Upstream, Gas and 
Downstream in Malaysia as part of Malaysia’s Fourth National 
Communication Report (NC4) to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 
Through this assessment populated in a Geographic 
Information System (GIS) system, climate hazards data such 
as sea level rise, coastal floods, river floods, droughts and 
temperature rise were gathered and forecasted up to year 
2100 for Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak. This 
initiative has created value by identifying high risk assets and 
serves as an input to our adaptation strategy.
PETRONAS also has completed vulnerability assessments in 
South Africa for Downstream refinery and retail operations. 
Key climate hazards are floods and storms. A training and 
upskilling session was conducted for Engen staff to enable 
them to develop and maintain an adaptation plan.
Accelerating Methane Emissions Management in 
PETRONAS
We align our methane emissions management with the 
Methane Guiding Principles (MGP) that prioritise key actions 
along the natural gas supply chain.
As a signatory member of the Methane Guiding Principles, 
we commit to advancing robust performance across gas 
value chains, enhancing the accuracy and quality of methane 
emissions data, advocating best practices, sound policies, 
and regulations on methane emissions, capability building 
and increasing the transparency of methane emissions to 
better manage them.
In 2022, PETRONAS became a member of the United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP) Oil and Gas Methane 
Partnership 2.0 (OGMP2.0) Reporting Framework, a multi-
stakeholder initiative established by UNEP and the Climate 
and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC). OGMP2.0 provides a 
comprehensive, measurement-based reporting framework 
that improves the accuracy and transparency of methane 
emissions reporting in the energy sector.
1 
Advancing Techniques for Methane Measurement 
Acknowledging the importance of reporting accurate 
methane emissions to facilitate effective reduction, 
PETRONAS is improving our quantification beyond the 
main emissions sources of flaring, venting and 
combustion. Rigorous efforts were made throughout 2022 
to improve methane data accuracy for PETRONAS’ natural 
gas value chain covering 11 common sources below:
Intended Releases:

Safeguard the Environment
Methane quantification was based on best available 
operational data guided by internal and international 
standards from Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 
(OGMP2.0) and Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI). 
Additionally, PETRONAS’ Group Technical Solutions 
department have developed a quantification tool using 
location specific operational data and emission factors 
from the American Petroleum Institute (API) Compendium 
to perform the detailed quantification of methane 
emissions covering 11 common methane emissions 
sources.
Major methane sources i.e., flaring and venting, were 
measured using direct measurements (flowmeters) or 
quantified using detailed engineering calculations based on 
specific process parameters. For the remaining methane 
sources, improvements were made to the quantification by 
inventorying the equipment and components. Methane 
emissions were then estimated by multiplying the respective 
emission factors according to the equipment type with the 
number of equipment of the same type. 
We are improving quantification of fugitive emissions by 
moving away from an estimation approach using 
production values, to a more detailed quantification 
method at component level, or using actual leak survey 
data where available. This method provides a better 
understanding of methane emissions from each source. A 
key finding was that quantified fugitive methane emissions 
using granular data were lower than calculated estimates. 
We also have a better understanding of our emissions 
from compressor seals and pneumatic devices, which 
were never quantified previously.
 80 per cent to 90 per cent of our methane emissions 
along the natural gas value chain can be attributed 
to hydrocarbon venting, flaring and gas-driven 
pneumatic devices. We prioritise our mitigation 
measures to these areas through our current GHG 
emissions reduction projects. 
2 
Advocating for Methane Management to Partners
As the regulatory body overseeing Upstream operations in Malaysia and collaborating with partners across the ASEAN 
region, PETRONAS has initiated methane advocacy efforts nationally as well as internationally with the aim to increase 
awareness among our partners to effectively manage methane emissions. Through Malaysia Petroleum Management 
(MPM), PETRONAS rolled out the Exploration and Production Minimum Environmental Specification (MES) that outlines 
the requirements on methane emissions measurements, quantifications, and reporting by all upstream operators that are 
operating in Malaysia. Adhering to these standards ensures that reported methane emissions are accurate and 
consistent, thereby driving efforts towards reduction.
The ASEAN Energy Sector Methane Roundtable
Hosted by PETRONAS and supported by Thailand’s PTT Public Company Limited (PTT) and Indonesia’s Pertamina.
Objective:
To set a networking platform among the oil and gas players in Southeast Asia to advocate and promote effective 
methane emissions management. 
Outcome:
 Attended by participants from ASEAN national oil companies, several energy companies, as well as international, multilateral and 
non-governmental organisations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), World Bank, United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP) and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF).
 Strong network presence at the roundtables set the foundation for promoting capability building and technical knowledge sharing, 
improving methane emissions management practices and transparency in performance reporting, aligned with internationally 
recognised frameworks and standards.

Accelerating Competency for Methane Management
Since 2020, we have increased our efforts to raise awareness, build skills, and take action to reduce methane 
emissions throughout our operations. We conducted training sessions to improve employee knowledge on methane 
management and put into practice internal standards. These standards were aligned with industry expectations and 
guidance on managing methane emissions.
In addition, we developed e-learning modules on methane management to promote self-learning and increase 
awareness on achieving methane reduction targets.
Harnessing the Power of Technology to Aid GHG Emissions Reduction
PETRONAS is continuously finding opportunities to reduce its carbon emissions to meet our NZCE 2050 Pathway 
through various climate actions. In 2022, we achieved GHG emissions reductions of 0.6 Million tCO2e and 
cumulatively since 2013, we have reduced 18.1 Million tCO2e of GHG emissions from our operations. PETRONAS has 
classified its operational emissions reduction efforts into four decarbonisation levers as follows:
In 2022, PETRONAS conducted five upskilling sessions on methane emissions management for 84 internal 
practitioners aimed at strengthening their understanding in support of operationalising our internal standards, 
aligning to industry expectations and guidance on methane emissions management. In addition, methane 
e-learning was also developed to create an avenue of self-development that could accelerate awareness on 
methane emissions management.

Safeguard the Environment
In 2022, PETRONAS completed 44 projects and initiatives 
mainly covering zero routine flaring and venting 
reductions, energy efficiency, and electrification categories 
as follows: 
1 
Zero Routine Flaring and Venting
PETRONAS had conducted three flare reduction and one 
vent reduction projects in Upstream Business in Malaysia 
where 0.18 Million tCO2e was reduced in 2022. The 
projects were conducted using technologies that recover 
the hydrocarbon gas and monetise it.
 Three Flare Reduction: Kinabalu (0.003 Million tCO2e), 
Bintulu Integrated Facilities (0.09 Million tCO2e), Sabah 
Oil and Gas Terminal (0.05 Million tCO2e); and
 One Vent Reduction: Dulang (0.04 Million tCO2e)
2 
Energy Efficiency
40 energy efficiency and optimisation efforts throughout 
PETRONAS have also reduced 0.44 Million tCO2e in 2022.
 Upstream: Three projects and 0.09 Million tCO2e
 Gas: 15 projects and 0.19 Million tCO2e 
 Downstream: 22 projects and 0.16 Million tCO2e
3 
Electrification
The intent of electrification is to either increase efficiency 
or to switch to an electric source with a lower GHG 
emission factor compared to the existing practice. In 
2022, Malaysia LNG Sdn Bhd signed a Power Purchase 
Agreement with Syarikat SESCO Bhd, a subsidiary of 
Sarawak Energy, for 90MW of hydroelectric power import 
to PLC in Bintulu. This will result in about 40 per cent of 
PLC to be powered by renewable energy and reduce 
Scope 1 GHG emissions. 
4 
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) 
CCS efforts in PETRONAS are driven by the need to develop 
high carbon dioxide (CO2) gas fields. PETRONAS has been 
conducting research and development (R&D) on various 
capture technologies and patented a single and multi-stage 
membrane technology for onshore and offshore application 
in the past years. PETRONAS has also identified potential 
storage sites in offshore Malaysia. This has become an 
enabler to the development of CCS projects in PETRONAS.
Upstream business has embarked on a CCS project in the 
Kasawari gas field in offshore Sarawak to reinject the 
inherent CO2 from the gas reservoir into a neighbouring 
depleted oil and gas field. The CCS facility is expected to 
be in operation in stages starting from 2024 (Phase 1), 
with first injection in 2026 (Phase 2).
When operations are in full swing, the Kasawari project can 
potentially store 3.3 Million tonnes of CO2 per annum in a 
depleted reservoir making it the largest offshore CCS 
project in the world. 
In 2022, PETRONAS signed several Memoranda of 
Understanding (MoUs) on CCS to partner and explore 
opportunities across the CCS value chain. Moving forward 
PETRONAS is also looking into building a CCS hub and 
becoming a leader in the CCS business within the region.
Methane Emissions Management
PETRONAS continues to explore the optimal top-down 
methane measurement via various MoUs to assess emerging 
technologies. Among the technologies tested in 2022 were 
satellite and drone to measure methane emissions from 
onshore and nearshore facilities. Based on the evaluations, 
suitable top-down measurement technology will be selected 
to enable reconciliation with bottom-up measurement and 
meet OGMP2.0 Gold Standard expectations.
We tested satellite technology to measure methane 
emissions where the results showed no emissions above 
the detection threshold of 100kg/hr at PETRONAS sites.
PETRONAS is pursuing another remote sensing technology 
through strategic collaborations with a local drone service 
provider to test methane sensors on drones (multi-rotor 
type) at selected sites i.e. gas transmission assets, refineries 
and regasification terminals.
PETRONAS also entered into a collaboration to test a 
technology that enables continuous monitoring of methane 
emissions from the assets through visualisation as well as 
measurement capabilities.
Striving Towards GHG Emissions Reduction Targets
As a result of our enhanced emissions accounting practices, 
which includes a change in organisational boundary, we 
have adjusted our 2019 baseline reference to 54.87 Million 
tCO2e (previously calculated 57.73 Million tCO2e) via equity 
share approach.
PETRONAS’ short-term GHG emission target is to cap 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 operational emissions to 49.5 Million 
tCO2e by 2024 for PETRONAS operated assets in Malaysia. 
In 2022, operational emissions in Malaysia amounted to 
46.11 Million tCO2e (2021: 44.12 Million tCO2e).
In 2022, we achieved 0.6 Million tCO2e GHG emissions 
reduction from projects and cumulatively since 2013, we 
have reduced 18.1 Million tCO2e of GHG emissions from 
the implementation of decarbonisation activities for 
PETRONAS Groupwide assets under operational control.
170
PETRONAS Integrated Report 2022
Our Sustainabilit y Journey
171


The mid-term target for 2030 is to reduce 25 per cent of PETRONAS’ Groupwide Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 
under equity share approach, compared to the base year of 2019. To date, the reduction amounts to 8.49 per cent, 
delivered through projects addressing flaring and venting reduction and energy efficiency.
Our short-term methane target is to reduce 50 per cent of methane emissions from our natural gas value chain 
operations by 2025 compared to 2019. In 2022, we reduced absolute methane emissions by 49.88 per cent from 2019 
levels, with Upstream flaring and venting reduction efforts playing a significant role. These efforts included setting flaring 
and venting targets, operational campaigns, and implementing capital expenditure projects. We plan to further reduce 
our methane footprint through continued reduction efforts and improved quantification accuracy.
Special Highlights
PETRONAS’ commitment to the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 (ZRF) Initiative and UNEP’s OGMP2.0 can be 
presented using the three key metrics below – Upstream GHG intensity, share of methane in total GHG emissions and 
reduction of hydrocarbon venting.
Upstream GHG intensity for 
total upstream operations has 
reduced by 32.73 per cent from 
2019 driven by zero continuous 
flaring and venting requirement 
in PETRONAS Carbon 
Commitments.

Responsible Waste Management
Why Is It Important?
Waste management is a major challenge for society, as the overproduction of waste negatively impacts the environment, 
health, and economic growth. Effective waste management can reduce operational costs and environmental impact 
while improving reputation and stakeholder trust. 
What Is Our Approach?
We practice the concept of waste management hierarchy, namely remove, reduce, reuse, recycle, recover, and dispose 
in order of most to least environmentally preferred. Across all our sites, activities that generate waste are categorised 
and identified according to type, quantity, frequency of generation, handling requirements, treatment and disposal 
methods. Our waste management plans are regularly reviewed, while performance indicators are submitted monthly to 
a central reporting platform, which helps measure progress and performance. Typical waste generated from operations 
include oily sludge from tank cleaning activities, sludge from wastewater treatment plant, spent catalyst and spent oils.
In 2022, PETRONAS generated 144,620 tonnes of hazardous waste, an increase of 19,736 tonnes from 124,884 tonnes 
in 2021. The higher amount of waste generated in 2022 was contributed by scheduled maintenance and tank cleaning 
activities. The total amount of waste recycled or recovered during the year in review was 73,643 tonnes of which 
63,133 tonnes was attributed by operations in Malaysia. These are equivalent to waste recycling and recovery rates of 
51  per cent for the Group or 77 per cent for Malaysia operations.
Guided by international principles, frameworks and standards:
 Host country requirements on waste management
 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards on waste reporting
Waste Management

Managing Waste 
 
 In 2022, despite facing increased waste generation, we found opportunities to improve our waste management 
practices and increase our waste recycling and recovery rate, contributed largely by a close and continued 
collaboration between our operations and waste treatment technology and waste management service providers.
 
 Quarterly assurance assessments were also carried out at all off-site waste treatment and disposal facilities owned 
by our waste management contractors to verify that they meet both regulatory and our requirements. 
2 
Reducing and Reusing Hazardous Waste 
Oily sludge is one of the most common waste of our 
operations. In collaboration with the Shimizu Institute 
of Technology, we embarked on a pilot project to 
use carbonisation technology to treat hazardous 
waste, including oily sludge generated from the 
refining process. The initiative aims to explore broader 
means of a circular economy by reducing hazardous 
waste and reusing it for other purposes instead of 
merely disposing it to a licensed facility. The pilot 
project was funded by the Japan Cooperation Center 
for Petroleum and Sustainable Energy (JCCP), utilising 
selected sites provided by the Malaysia Refining 
Company Sdn. Bhd. (MRCSB).
During the Phase 1 pilot (50kg kiln), the identified 
hazardous waste types generated by MRCSB were 
tested in batches and was extended to other types of 
hazardous waste including Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO), 
used activated carbons, spent clay and effluent 
treatment sludges. The Phase 1 pilot test was 
completed in December 2022 and preliminary results 
showed promising results with 99.6 per cent to 99.9 
per cent of oil recovered from oily sludge samples 
and a weight reduction range of 84 per cent to 97 
per cent for all samples. Phase 2 pilot testing is 
planned in 2023, utilising 500kg kiln capacity. The 
pilot results will determine the feasibility for full-scale 
implementation.

Circular Economy
PETRONAS’ Circular Economy Definition
A circular economy is a systemic approach that 
moves away from a linear (take-make-waste) 
economy to one that extends the life cycle of 
materials and resources, ultimately reducing waste 
to a minimum.
For PETRONAS, circular economy is integral to 
our sustainability approach, embedded across the 
group to
i. 
enable a low waste future
ii. steward natural resources
iii. minimise our carbon footprint 
while creating value.
We aim to contribute to a circular future, 
providing impactful solutions to our stakeholders 
and the betterment of our society through 
innovation and collaboration. 
Why Plastics?
Plastics have become a vital component in the economy 
given its usefulness in our everyday lives. It is a durable 
and lightweight material that has been used widely across 
industries worldwide. However, when it is used or 
disposed in an irresponsible manner, it becomes a 
significant problem as it is made of non-biodegradable 
material. Plastic waste is a significant part of the problem, 
and we are addressing it by promoting a circular economy 
and moving toward a New Plastics Economy (NPE). By 
recycling plastic products, we are minimising waste, 
promoting innovation, and creating new business 
opportunities. This supports a circular supply chain, 
reduces carbon footprint, conserves raw materials, and 
lessens the use of fossil fuels, all of which contribute to a 
more sustainable future.
We are addressing this by promoting circular economy 
and moving towards a NPE. By recycling plastic products, 
we are minimising waste, promoting innovation, and 
creating new business opportunities. We believe that our 
shift towards circularity will have a positive multiplier 
1 
PETRONAS’ Positioning on Plastics
The increasingly harmful impact of plastic pollution on 
life and the environment is prompting regulations to 
crack down on plastic pollution, both globally and 
nationally, and has intensified in the last year alone, with 
industries facing the greatest risk and pressure to act. 
Plastic’s wide range of applications includes medical, 
hospitality, construction/building, as well as fittings and 
furnishings. What makes plastics ‘problematic’ are 
single-use plastics (SUPs), such as plastic bottles, cutlery, 
and containers that are almost certainly littered. These 
are the primary sources of plastic pollution, with plastic 
bottles accounting for the greatest volume.
This year, we introduced PETRONAS’ Position on 
Single-Use Plastics, which centres on our strategic focus 
on phasing out single-use plastics. 
As we have a wide footprint across the plastics value 
chain, both as producers and consumers, this presents a 
wide range of opportunities for us to transition according 
to our circular economy principles and sustainability 
approach. Through this positioning, we acknowledge that 
plastics are still useful in industries such as food 
packaging, medical equipment, household appliances, etc. 
and recognise the need to take steps to strengthen their 
design and end-use sustainability. This will be done by 
phasing out problematic and unnecessary SUPs. In 
addition, we will also develop systemic plastic collection 
and recycling mechanisms at our operations to stop 
plastic waste from polluting or leaking into the 
Value Creation in 2022
effect, as we have in place a long value-chain that serves 
our ecosystem partners and broader society. Our ability to 
do this supports a circular supply chain, reduces carbon 
footprint and renders better stewardship of raw materials.
What Is Our Approach?
Through the circular economy approach, we have taken a 
waste-to-products approach, where we convert waste to 
base materials or other products to create sustainable 
value. However, we believe that the circular economy is 
not just about recycling and reusing but, instead, solving 
the problem at its source to eliminate waste and pollution. 
This will help us realise our NZCE 2050 Pathway.
We also continue to deepen our research and technology 
to identify gaps and accelerate our circular economy 
initiatives, as this will ensure sustainable consumption. Our 
ability to do so will lead to creating a more resilient 
economy.
environment. This creates value by regenerating end-of-
life plastic into valuable materials hence closing the loop 
in plastic circularity.
PETRONAS has a considerable footprint in the plastics 
value chain, both as a producer and a consumer, 
which means there are opportunities for us to 
transition according to our circular economy principles 
and our approach to sustainability. This enables 
PETRONAS to continue protecting value while also 
being a force for good.
PETRONAS Chemicals Group (PCG) leads the NPE 
initiative as it has embarked on Operation Clean Sweep 
(OCS), which is a global programme to eliminate 
plastic resin leakage to the environment during 
production and distribution.
In support of this, PETRONAS Lubricants International 
(PLI) launched the Bag-In-Box in Europe. This is a new 
20-litre format made with recyclable cardboard and 
plastic, which guarantees loading, safety, and 
palletisation advantages, including an integrated tap.
Based on the recently launched Plastics Positioning, 
plastics will now be viewed as a force of good where 
we leverage circularity to encourage collaborative 
solutions that generate sustainable plastics, moving 
away from the traditional linear approach.

Producing Waste-based Fuels
We participated in the Mid-Term Review of the 12th Malaysia Plan (RMK-12) – Technical Working Group (Oil and 
Gas and New Energy) Workshop by the Ministry of Economy. We presented a paper on the development of 
bio-economy in Malaysia, where we communicated our capabilities in leading Malaysia’s bio-economy industry as a 
part of Malaysia’s decarbonisation journey in achieving NZCE 2050. Through this presentation, we highlighted 
Malaysia’s capabilities in being a regional leader in producing waste-based biofuels, especially Sustainable Aviation 
Fuel (SAF), Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO) and other biofuel products via our first bio-refinery in Pengerang. 
This biorefinery aims to achieve Final Investment Decision (FID) in 2023 and be commissioned by 2026.
The establishment of this bio-refinery will create a bio-economy ecosystem in Malaysia, including the full value 
chain for feedstock sourcing and biochemicals. Once fully operational, this bio-refinery is expected to drive the 
local economy, generate more than 5,000 new jobs, benefit more than 1,000 SMEs and attract more than USD2 
billion in green Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Malaysia.

Developing Plastic Modified Bitumen
We introduced our latest technology, Plastic Modified Bitumen (PMB), consisting of plastic waste mixed with 
bitumen. This mix of repurposed waste gives it extra strength and higher cohesiveness while reducing the 
maintenance lifecycle, making it a favourable material for infrastructure.
We tested these solutions at two separate locations, namely PETRONAS Research Sdn Bhd (PRSB) in September 
2021 and at the Malaysian Federal roads, Jalan Simpang Pulai-Lojing-Blue Valley in December 2022. 
Given the promising results, we will be collaborating with several government agencies in 2023. We will also be 
showcasing this technology to potential local and international partners. 
5 
Achieving a Circular Economy for Plastic Waste in Malaysia
Through PCG, we have set a target to recover 100 per cent of plastic waste equivalent to domestic polymer sales 
by 2030. To achieve this, we will focus on four key areas: innovation, infrastructure, education and clean-up. We 
are collaborating with various stakeholders, including waste management concessionaires, recyclers and technology 
providers, to create innovative solutions and enable a plastic circular ecosystem in Malaysia. This will enhance the 
recyclability of plastic materials and regenerate end-of-life plastic into valuable materials.
Under the innovation workstream, we collaborated with Plastic Energy Ltd to develop innovative solutions for 
plastic waste. This involves turning low quality, mixed plastic waste into pyrolysis oil, which can be further 
processed to produce certified circular polymers. 
To strengthen the infrastructure system, we partnered with waste management companies; namely Alam Flora, 
KDEB Waste Management, One Biosys and E-Idaman to unlock the value of plastic waste ecosystem in Malaysia. 
Through these partnerships, we can ensure a secure supply of plastic waste, which is a crucial feedstock for 
converting plastic waste into circular polymers.
 PMB will extend the lifecycle of pavement and roads by 25 per cent.
 Every 100 metres with plastic-modified bitumen utilises a minimum of 79kg of plastic waste.

PETRONAS’ Environmental Focus Areas
Why Is It Important?
Managing environmental quality is essential to the preservation of our planet and the protection of our natural 
ecosystem. Irresponsible business activities can have severe consequences, such as oil spills, air pollution and resource 
scarcity. These consequences not only affect the health and well-being of humans, but also pose a threat to 
biodiversity and the sustainability of our planet. Managing environmental quality involves responsible resource utilisation, 
pollution prevention and sustainable practices which can help mitigate these environmental consequences. 
From a business perspective, effective management of environmental quality can result in significant cost savings and 
improved operational efficiency and enhanced reputation. Minimising our environmental impact through responsible and 
sustainable practices can reduce waste, conserve resources and limit exposure to environmental liabilities. It also builds 
trust among our employees and reinforces our position as a corporate citizen.

In 2022, the Group’s sulphur oxides emissions 
increased to 60,116 tonnes compared with 47,954 
tonnes in 2021. The increase in emission load was 
attributable to higher gas production in Sarawak’s 
Upstream asset and gas processing plant.
Total nitrogen oxides emissions for 2022 stood at 
62,790 tonnes from 133,962 tonnes in 2021, mainly 
due to omission of emission load data from ships due 
to ongoing review of reporting method, and revision 
in calculation methodology for floating LNG and 
power plant.
What Is Our Approach?
At PETRONAS, we recognise the important role we have 
in managing our relationship with the environment. 
Throughout our operations and business, we implement 
various assessments, practices and site-specific actionable 
plans to protect the environment.
We continue to make significant investments to reduce 
our environmental impact by implementing and inculcating 
a strong environmental protection culture throughout our 
supply and value chain. As we work with a broad range of 
suppliers, partners and vendors, we ensure they are also 
optimising their environmental footprint in key areas. We 
do this by encouraging them to adhere to our sustainable 
practices and improve their own environmental footprint 
as well. We also pursue collaborations with our stakeholders 
to ensure we gain a wider reach. By working together 
with our partners and stakeholders, we can create a 
positive impact on the environment and protect it for 
future generations.

Biodiversity
Why Is It Important? 
Biodiversity is the total sum of life on Earth comprising 
flora, fauna, microorganisms, ecosystems and habitats as 
well as the interdependent relationships between all of 
them. We depend on this web of life, both terrestrial and 
marine, to gain access to fresh water, food, medicine and 
a stable climate – all of which help sustain livelihoods, 
human health and economies. 
Our inability to conserve and protect biodiversity will adversely 
affect the benefits it provides. For example, forests and 
wetlands are essential in our efforts to combat climate 
change by sequestering carbon while providing a habitat for 
various species, protecting coastlines and supporting 
surrounding communities as sources of livelihood. Where 
PETRONAS is concerned, our relationship with biodiversity 
is one of the impacts and dependencies where our 
activities could potentially impact the biodiversity around us.
At the same time, PETRONAS also depends on biodiversity 
and ecosystem services such as water, land and marine 
resources for the continuity of our operations. 
As such, we are responsible for protecting and, where 
necessary, reversing biodiversity loss to avoid irreversible 
damage, which may impact our ability to deliver on our 
business goals and Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 
Pathway. Within this context, protecting Malaysia’s 
biodiversity is important to PETRONAS, given our large 
operational footprint in the country and its large potential 
for forest-based carbon offsets and the fact that Malaysia 
is one of the 17 mega diverse countries in the world, 
despite its small land mass.

What Is Our Approach? 
In 2022, PETRONAS established our Position on Nature 
and Biodiversity (the Position) to improve oversight on our 
nature and biodiversity footprint at enterprise level and 
strengthen our attainment of NZCE 2050 aspiration. In 
establishing the Position, PETRONAS was guided by 
various international agreements and national policies such 
as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and 
Malaysia’s National Policy on Biological Diversity 2016-
2025, as well as industry best practices from organisations 
such as Ipieca (i.e., the global oil and gas association for 
advancing environmental and social performance across 
the energy transition), the International Association of Oil 
and Gas Producers (IOGP) and the World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). The Position 
consists of five areas of action that demonstrate visible 
leadership in nature and biodiversity conservation, 
harnessing the right expertise and resources to positively 
impact the nation and the ASEAN region.

We proactively conduct HHRA beyond facility fencelines 
to evaluate community exposure to chemicals in the 
ambient environment. Since 2018, we have been 
conducting baseline HHRAs at selected operations and 
continued our efforts in 2022 to establish the 
environmental health risk profile for our global operations. 
From the baseline HHRAs, we have identified areas of 
improvement to reduce chemical exposures in air 
emissions and groundwater, going beyond regulatory 
compliance.

Services (BES) Working 
Group, the National 
Biodiversity Roundtable and 
the Malaysia Platform for 
Business and Biodiversity.
We believe that nature-based 
climate solutions form an 
important lever to offset 
residual and hard-to-abate 
emissions. Going forward we 
will identify investments that 
will generate high-quality 
carbon credits which will 
benefit the community and 
conserve the nature and 
biodiversity of the area. 
*  Outstanding Universal Value means cultural and/or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries 
and to be of common importance for present and future generations of all humanity. As such, the permanent protection of this 
heritage is of the highest importance to the international community as a whole. The Committee defines the criteria for the 
inscription of properties on the World Heritage List.
PETRONAS’ Position on Nature and Biodiversity 
The introduction of our nature and biodiversity position enables us to accelerate our momentum in establishing plans 
and ensuring internal alignment on nature and biodiversity matters. We will shape the necessary work processes, 
systems and establish a centralised database to ensure the smooth implementation of this positioning, which will be 
enforced in 2024. To operationalise the Position during 2023, PETRONAS will also strengthen our capacity and 
capability on nature and biodiversity, including setting up a dedicated Centre of Excellence (CoE). Moving forward, we 
will continue to focus our efforts in making progress in the below key focus areas: 
Establishing 
voluntary 
exclusion zones
Managing 
nature and 
biodiversity risk
 Ensure no new operations or 
projects are conducted in 
UNESCO World Heritage Sites 
commencing 2024, in 
recognition of the Universal 
Values* of these sites. 
 Ensure no or minimal impact on biodiversity due to our operations 
and projects. 
 Achieve net positive impact (NPI) on nature and biodiversity from 
2024 onwards for new projects in Protected Areas and Key 
Biodiversity Areas.
 Develop a Biodiversity Action Plan for new projects in Protected 
Areas and Key Biodiversity Areas from 2024 onwards. 
 Existing “Very High” and “High Risk” operations identified through 
the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (BES) risk profiling, will also 
have Biodiversity Action Plans. 
 Establish a site-specific inventory of important biodiversity features 
at existing sites, with due consideration given to additional 
conservation measures using a risk-based approach. 
We will ensure governance 
mechanisms are embedded 
within our internal processes 
to ensure no new investments 
are made in UNESCO World 
Heritage sites, effective 2024. 
We completed the BES Risk Profiling for domestic operations in 
2020. We also conducted Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services 
Risk Assessment (BESRA) and prepared the Biodiversity Action 
Plan (BAP) for BES sites identified as “Very High” and “High Risk”. 
A preliminary desktop assessment was conducted for our existing 
international assets via the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment 
Tool (IBAT). We also performed further assessments to determine 
the risk rating, including via Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA), for projects located near environmentally-sensitive areas.

Health and Safety
Why Is It Important?
The health and safety of our employees and contractors is 
of paramount importance to us. Given the nature of our 
industry, our people are exposed to a range of health and 
safety risks, such as hazardous environments, exposure to 
pressurised hydrocarbon, gas and chemicals, as well as 
heavy machinery and equipment. Workplace injuries and 
incidents can lead to severe impacts for both our business 
and stakeholders.
The consequences of poor health and safety practices are 
far-reaching and can result in regulatory fines and 
penalties, stop-work orders and reputational damage.
But above all, our people’s physical and mental well-being 
are at stake, affecting their quality of life and ability to 
work and care for their families. Poor health and safety in 
the workplace can even lead to loss of life, with 
devastating effects on loved ones.
Four fatalities were recorded despite the increased focus 
on safety culture and improving safety practices. The 
fatalities reported were from fire, electrocution, dislodged 
pipeline and diving activity. Following these tragedies, we 
conducted four groupwide Health, Safety and Environment 
(HSE) stand-downs attended by 54,000 participants, 
underscoring our continuous commitment to prioritising 
the health and safety of our people. Immediate 
interventions have been implemented to address key 
issues and reduce incidents by strengthening frontliner 
and contractor competency, compliance to HSE 
requirements, as well as intensifying learning culture. 
We also observed a 33 per cent increase in employee 
Total Recordable Occupational Illness Frequency (TROIF) 
compared to 2021. Food poisoning was one of the 
contributors with 35 cases reported. To avoid recurrences, 
interventions were implemented to ensure our external 
caterers for food and water supply are verified by the 
Ministry of Health (MOH). 
]For more information about our health and safety performance, 
please refer to page 253]
Given the inherent risks in our industry, the ability to 
effectively promote a culture of safety throughout our 
operations enables employees and contractors to achieve 
their full potential, as they feel safe, secure and engaged. 
This will lead to a more high-performing and productive 
work environment. Moreover, investments in health and 
safety will strengthen our position as a caring and 
responsible organisation to retain top talent in the industry.
We have a comprehensive list of policies, guidelines 
and standards that ensure a culture of health and safety:
 PETRONAS HSE Policy
 PETRONAS Substance Misuse Policy
 PETRONAS HSE Management System (HSEMS)
 PETRONAS HSE Mandatory Control Framework (MCF)
 PETRONAS Technical Standards (PTS) 
 PETRONAS Technical Guidelines (PTG)
 Hazard Effect Management Process (HEMP) 
 Process Safety Loss of Primary Containment 
Reduction (PSLR) Framework
 Fire Prevention and Mitigation Framework (FPMF)
 PETRONAS Contingency Planning Standard
 Crisis and Incident Management System
What Is Our Approach?
At PETRONAS, we continuously reinforce a culture of safety 
across our operations, taking cue from the learnings gained 
over the last few years. This is important given the 
transformation in our work environment as the country 
transitioned into COVID-19 endemicity. We drive impactful 
interventions, mainly enhancing competencies and driving 
culture and assurance, enabled by digital technology. We 
continuously scale up contractor management and 
strengthen the implementation of the Generative HSE 
Culture (GC) programme at all levels through Accountability 
and Behaviour Reinforcement Programme (ABR). The ABR 
encourages HSE Desired Behaviours across our operations, 
and minimises undesired behaviours.
In addition to the current standards, guidelines, systems 
and processes, we pushed ahead on improving HSE First 
Line Assurance to drive HSE Management System and 
Legal Compliance groupwide, which included Self-
Regulation capability development. Meanwhile, Process 
Safety continues to experience further improvements with 
the establishment of the Loss of Primary Containment 
(LOPC) Reduction Framework and the Fire Prevention and 
Mitigation Framework (FPMF).
In terms of risk management, we subscribe to Hazards 
and Effects Management Process (HEMP) which ensures 
hazards and risks are controlled. We use As Low As 
Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) principle to set the control 
levels for risks. Additionally, we continue to leverage on 
HSSE Integrated Risk Assessment (HIRA), a one-stop centre 
for risk assessment located in myHSSE, which provides 
analysis, trends and also common issues that require 
efficient intervention.
As a leading integrated global energy company, we 
play a crucial role in shaping the future. We take a 
collaborative approach to embedding sustainability 
into our practices, working hand in hand with our 
employees, suppliers, and communities to promote 
responsible growth.

Culture
Shaping Generative HSE Culture Towards Self-Regulation
We strengthened our safety culture by introducing the Generative HSE Culture (GC) Framework, which promotes 
accountability and pace to business units, operating units and assets based on site-specific needs. Themed 
“Doing Things Differently”, we collaborated with Institut Teknologi Petroleum (INSTEP) whereby INSTEP will fully 
manage and execute the GC training programmes, and work towards Self-Regulation (SR) certification. This was 
done to enable Group Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) to refocus on enhancing the overall effectiveness of 
this programme, maintain standards and quality, perform continuous improvements and measure impact based 
on its alignment to SR requirements and expectations.
Regular engagements with key stakeholders across all business units were conducted to ensure alignment with 
the Generative HSE Culture framework and strategy to drive the GC journey forward.
Generative HSE Culture Highlights:
Generative HSE Culture Highlights:
• 25 engagement sessions to drive GC forward.
• Developed three new GC modules to align with Self-Regulation Framework.
• Total number of 1,209 GC participants trained in 2022.
• Developed governance documents on GC trainings in collaboration with INSTEP.
HSE Accountability and Behaviour Reinforcement (ABR)
Good behaviours often go unnoticed. But when things go wrong, we are quick to jump and forget to consider human 
factors. With HSE Accountability & Behaviour Reinforcement (HSE ABR), it is different. 
PETRONAS continues the implementation of HSE ABR programme, which was rolled out in 2021 to elevate the HSE 
Culture towards achieving Generative HSE Culture. The HSE ABR is to ensure a consistent approach across PETRONAS 
when recognising and rewarding the Desired HSE Behaviour, and fairness when addressing Undesired HSE Behaviour. 
In 2022, through the HSE ABR implementation, we achieved the following:
• Evaluated Human Behaviour Categorisation (HBC) elements in 97 per cent of completed investigations on major HSE 
incidents and major HSE non-compliances.
• 100 per cent domestic operations and selected international operations have HSE ABR Committee (ABRC) established.
• Successful integration of other HSE Systems with the HSE ABR system, which improves management of positive and 
constructive reinforcements.
Value Creation in 2022
We continued to reiterate the importance of building a culture of Health and Safety throughout our operations and
processes, as this will protect our employees, improve productivity and strengthen our reputation in the industry.
Digital myHSSE at PETRONAS
The myHSSE digital platform serves as our one-stop knowledge centre for all PETRONAS Health, 
Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE) matters.
By adopting a single information platform that houses all 16 systems of our HSSE digital 
solutions, each of which addresses different business pain points for users’ easier access and 
fit-for-purpose usage.
We are also enabling users to harness the power of HSSE data to derive insights on HSSE 
performance, trends, emerging risks and other essential elements so that we can make 
proactive interventions. As we move towards our goal of realising predictive and even 
prescriptive HSSE analytics. Group HSE endeavours to improve this further.

Crisis Management Information System (CMIS)
Launched in 2019, Crisis Management Information System 
(CMIS) is a digital solution that minimises human actions 
and communications errors by providing technology and 
systems to manage emergencies and crises at enterprise 
level.
CMIS has allowed us to enhance crisis management best 
practices as it provides real-time emergency response 
updates to internal stakeholders seamlessly transfer data 
and information. We have also integrated state-of-the-art 
oil spill consequence modelling tool (OILMAP) into CMIS 
to enable swift and comprehensive emergency response 
to oil spill incidents.
 Conducted 16 CMIS trainings and 2 webinars across 
PETRONAS Group. 
 Utilised in 8 Tier-2 and 2 Tier-3 emergency exercises, 
with positive feedback from stakeholders.
COVID-19 Reporting and Monitoring 
As Malaysia transitions towards endemicity and business 
activities resume, we ensured seamless and safe normalcy 
interventions on readiness and implementation of processes 
and procedures to return to office through 50 per cent 
work in office and 50 per cent work from home rotation 
and subsequently 100 per cent with Flexi-Work 
Arrangement, including opening up for unvaccinated and 
partially vaccinated employees, without disruptions.
As part of our COVID-19 reporting and monitoring, 
Strategic Crisis Management in collaboration with 
Occupational Health (OH) division, spearheaded the 
introduction of Microsoft Forms and a digital dashboard to 
replace the conventional Notification Form (NF) used 
previously to report COVID-19 cases. The dashboard 
provided overall insights into the latest COVID-19 situation 
across our businesses and operations. With this in hand, 
the Executive Leadership Team and Corporate Command 
Centre (C3) were able to make data-driven decisions and 
decide on the right approach to be taken by its Pandemic 
Preparedness and Response Team (PPRT). 
Our ability to make effective and swift adjustments amidst 
an evolving environment is considered to have led to a 
significant reduction in COVID-19 cases, clusters and 
deaths following the introduction of stringent measures 
and effective communications across all businesses and 
operations. 
Leveraging Digital Technology in Managing Crisis and Emergencies
PETRONAS Communication and Control Centre (COMCEN)
COMCEN is PETRONAS’ one-stop centre for incident and crisis management, as well as the designated centre to 
coordinate and respond to emergencies and crisis. This one-stop centre manages numerous HSE and Security-related 
incident notifications and crisis, including issuance of various HSE advisories and warnings across our businesses.
We implemented measures to protect the health of our 
workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic while ensuring 
business sustainability through effective collaborations 
between Pandemic Preparedness and Response Team 
(PPRT) COVID-19 members, internal and external 
stakeholders including government and private bodies.
Prioritising Industrial Hygiene
One of our topmost priorities is to ensure the health of 
our employees and contractors within and beyond the 
workplace. We go beyond regulatory compliance and 
implement global best practices to deliver sustainable 
value and ensure a dedicated, productive and high-
performing workforce. This include continuous efforts to 
address all workplace health hazards and respective risks 
such as chemical hazards, physical hazards (i.e., noise, 
radiation, thermal and vibrations), as well as biological, 
ergonomic and psycho-social hazards.
In 2022, we made progress on the following areas:
Hazardous Chemical Management
We strengthened the management of hazardous chemicals 
aimed to reduce overexposure to hazardous chemicals and 
increase compliance. One such initiative is an online digital 
platform named eCHEMS that manages and tracks the 
procurement, receiving and storage of hazardous chemicals. 
The digital system minimises human-interface manhours 
spent on verifying compliance of incoming procured 
hazardous chemicals and ultimately reduce the possibility 
of rejection at the receiving end. 
 Reduced 94 per cent of manhours to produce 
daily COVID-19 reports and achieved cost 
avoidance of up to RM300,000.
 Zero business and reputational interruptions recorded.
 Achieved 99.8 per cent primary vaccine uptake 
and booster uptake as compared to 49.7 per cent 
for Malaysia’s overall population.
In scaling up our efforts to improve safety performance, we proactively implemented various initiatives and measurements 
to ensure safety precautions are embedded throughout our businesses and operations.
Achieving HSE Compliance Through Self-Regulation (SR)
We continue to improve on our Self-Regulation practices and strived to achieve Self-Regulation certifications as this 
would result in a higher level of compliance towards legal and safety standards, as well as effective implementation 
measures to control hazards and minimise incidents.
We focused on driving key engagements and alignment of the Self-Regulation Implementation Masterplan with key 
stakeholders and completed the necessary pre-certification audits and Self-Regulation culture assessments. We also 
ensured Self-Regulation Department (SRD) personnel obtained the required certifications to strengthen SRD as a 
qualified third-party auditor for Self-Regulation implementation and surveillance audit in PETRONAS.
In terms of governance, we officialised the Self-Regulation Tripartite comprising members from Regulator (DOSH), 
Occupiers (PETRONAS OPUs) and Third-party Service Providers (Institut Teknologi PETRONAS (INSTEP) and Universiti 
Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP)) as a platform that advocates Self-Regulation governance and regulations to support and 
sustain SR Programme journey towards operational and compliance excellence. We also completed the integration of 
PETRONAS Self-Regulation System (PSRS) with other relevant PETRONAS systems namely PETRONAS Risk-Based 
Inspection (PRBI), myAssurance and Health, Safety, Security, and Environment (HSSE) Monitoring and Reporting System 
(MARS), creating an integrated digital platform for the SR programme implementation which was deployed to all OPUs 
embarking on the programme.
Compliance
Conducted SR Implementation Masterplan engagement with 24 CEOs and OPU Heads including leaders from 
Upstream governance departments, as well as Department of Occupation, Safety and Health (DOSH) state 
representatives to share and roll-out the Masterplan. 
Achieved certification for 22 out of 27 SRD personnel with ISO45001 as Lead Auditor by Chartered Quality Institute 
(CQI) and International Register of Certificated Auditors (IRCA) in preparation for SRD to become the SR Qualified 
Third-Party for PETRONAS. 
Conducted 10 stakeholder engagements and workshops with OPUs and DOSH representatives to facilitate and 
provide the necessary advisory on the development and implementation of Self-Regulation programme. 
Completed seven audits and Culture Baseline assessments in four OPUs as part of their overall journey 
towards SR certification.

done through Noise Engineering Control studies targeting 
identified high noise-emitting equipment and enhanced 
controls.
Digitalising the Health Risk Assessment (HRA) 
Health Risk Assessment (HRA) was digitalised and 
integrated into HSSE Integrated Risks Assessment (HIRA). 
We implemented the enhanced HRA methodology, 
focusing on operationalisation and integration into other 
Safe System of Work (SSOW). The enhanced methodology 
includes a newly-developed psychosocial risk assessment 
(PsyRA), improving how workplace psychosocial risk 
factors are being identified and assessed.
 Operationalisation of HRA output within other 
Safe System of Work, and overall company health 
risk profile.
Advanced Ergonomics Risk Assessment (ERA)
We fortified the Ergonomics Risk Management by 
implementing the Advanced Ergonomics Risk Assessment 
(ERA) Tool, which is known as Humantech and 
Ergonomics Control Inventory. 
 Reduced ergonomic risk from 60 per cent in 2021 
to 20 per cent in 2022 and achieved time saving 
for 50 tasks in 12 locations through Advanced ERA. 
Improved Risk Management Related to Industrial Hygiene
We continue to conduct First Line Assurance for Business 
Units, OPUs and our assets, which looks into managing 
risks related to Industrial Hygiene that are linked to 
day-to-day operational activities. We achieved increase in 
overall compliance as follows: 
Reduced noise  
exceeding limit by
60%
and zero cases in 
noise overexposure. 
 Seven Second Line Assurances and 17 
unannounced visits were conducted at selected 
sites to strengthen site compliance of HSE 
requirements.
 As an effort to better understand the human 
performance aspects that contributes to incidents, 
PETRONAS has introduced the Categorisation of 
Incident Causes (CIC) that further defines 
categories of Human Factor for every incident 
investigation.
 This led to improved site discipline and interventions:
– Experienced a 55 percent increase in Stop 
Work Authority (SWA) from the previous year.
– Reported a 20 per cent increase in Unsafe Act 
Unsafe Conditions (UAUC) from the previous 
year.

Proactive Security Risk Management
The robustness of our security controls and practices is 
vital to how we do our business. Gap closure efforts, 
assurance activities, penetration tests and security drills 
were some of the key activities carried out in the year 
under review covering selected domestic and international 
assets. A key effort included fortifying and streamlining 
compliance to our Security Policy via execution of the 
PETRONAS Group Management Framework, with roll-out 
planned in 2023. The Groupwide undertaking to enhance 
governance and assurance marks a formalised approach to 
accelerate security excellence in all that we do, through 
clear, concerted and coordinated initiatives, supported by 
improved communication on demarcation of roles and 
responsibilities. 
Additionally, we continued to provide proactive security 
insights to facilitate informed management decision that 
take into account evolving external vulnerabilities.
2 
Partnering for Greater Security
We believe in fostering closer ties with various 
stakeholders in Malaysia, including enforcement agencies, 
to strengthen security excellence for propelling energy 
security. 
In 2022, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding 
(MoU) with the Royal Malaysia Police to further strengthen 
collaboration on security awareness and the integration of 
best practices via cooperation in training and operational 
support. This aims to spur collective knowledge sharing 
and enhanced capabilities for PETRONAS’ onshore and 
offshore assets in Malaysia. 
The aim is to strengthen our resilience and robustness as 
we navigate a more dynamic business environment. 
We also worked with various enforcement agencies to 
strengthen maritime security, deploying a range of assets 
for optimum surveillance of our offshore interests 
including unmanned platforms. The joint operations led to 
zero intrusion cases between June and December 2022. 
We also leveraged our Auxiliary Police (AP) personnel at 
our onshore assets in Malaysia. The APs are entrusted with 
enforcement powers as stipulated in the Police Act 1967. 
The coverage of PETRONAS’ APs also includes certain 
offshore platforms that have been identified as national 
Value Creation in 2022
critical infrastructure. Targeted joint operations with the 
local enforcement agencies were carried out on several 
occasions. 
Additionally, we partnered with the industry players to 
drive collective action via the Sahabat Maritim programme 
to drive awareness on the dangers of vessel 
encroachment within the 500 metre safety radius 
surrounding our offshore operation. The programme 
ongoing since 2015, also educates local communities in 
Sabah and Labuan on wider security and safety 
implications.

Preventing Substance Misuse
Substance misuse can result in security issues, leading us 
to embark on Tempat Kerja Bebas Dadah (TEKAD), a 
programme under the Agensi Antidadah Kebangsaan, 
AADK, Malaysia.
TEKAD is a strategic partnership to promote a workplace 
free of substance misuse. It promoted discussions across 
multidisciplinary teams on illegal, prohibited substances 
and arising complexities if mismanaged.
The awareness programme involving staff and contractors 
also included a Training of Trainers (ToT) for our Auxiliary 
Police (APs) to undertake urine screening for drug 
detection. This was conducted as per the Police Act, P.U.A 
461/1970 and relevant clauses/sections from Act 234 
(Dangerous Drugs Act 1952) and Act 283 (Drug 
Dependants (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Act 1983). 
5,108
staff and 
contractors were

We are fully committed to implementing a high-level, well-coordinated and integrated 
security approach that safeguards our assets, ensures the safety of our people wherever we 
operate and provides sustainable value for our stakeholders.
Security
Why Is It Important? 
Persistent geopolitical tensions, global economic 
uncertainties, increased competition, extreme weather 
patterns and accelerated technological development have 
increased security concerns. Given our wide geographical 
spread and the asset-heavy nature of our operations, we 
are strengthening our security preparedness further to 
withstand the changing risk environment.
Our business value chain including offshore and onshore 
assets are exposed to protests, violence, crime, insider 
threat, terrorist attacks and geopolitical conflicts. The 
increasing use of technology has also led to cybersecurity 
threats and consequently cyber-crimes which call for a 
holistic focus on enterprise security management. These 
interruptions may lead to incidental exposures, operational 
disruptions, supply chain breakdowns, ransomware, price 
risks and decreased productivity, which lower our ability to 
deliver sustainable stakeholder value. We are committed to 
maintain a high-level, well-coordinated and integrated 
security approach for the integrity of our assets and safety 
of our people, wherever we operate.
What Is Our Approach?
Our emphasis is on ensuring security excellence 
throughout our value chain. We continuously elevate our 
in-house security culture, harnessing physical security 
infrastructure and technologies to optimise business 
efficiencies and productivity whilst providing a conducive 
workplace. We also embed a security mindset into our 
organisational culture, supported by coordinated cross-
functional awareness measures. 
We are governed by the laws and regulations of the 
countries where we operate. Our practices are supported 
by robust internal governance stipulations that are 
regularly updated to help us adapt to the ever-changing 
external operating environment. With the rising focus on 
digital security, we fortified our priority on digitalisation, 
operational and strategic security acumens, steered by 
governance, compliance, capabilities, communications and 
technology application. 
We established a security academy with targeted 
programmes to hone a pool of capable security personnel 
and equip them with suitable capabilities. We offer timely 
security training and ground exposure that prepares 
colleagues to manage security effectively, particularly at 
our high-risk operations. 
We also pursued industry-wide engagements to uphold a 
conducive working environment and prevent maritime 
security threats on our shores in Malaysia.

Strengthening Security with Technology
Our security personnel are our frontliners protecting our 
assets, information, employees and communities to ensure 
uninterrupted operations. Hence it is vital that we equip 
them with the latest security equipment and cutting-edge 
technology.
In 2022, we completed a pilot project in in Pengerang, 
Johor, to maximise our AP’s enforcement powers by 
expanding their focus into marine, investigation and air 
units. In addition to testing a drone surveillance and 
monitoring system at the PETRONAS Twin Towers and the 
East Coast Region, we introduced a facial recognition 
system at the PETRONAS Twin Towers to improve security 
at our headquarters. Concurrently, we engaged relevant 
authorities and agencies on proactive counter-drone 
measures – exploring the feasibility of drone jammers the 
need for streamlined standard operating procedures on 
drone management activities for the corporate sector in 
Malaysia. 
We also enabled centralised monitoring with an Integrated 
Security Control Centre, equipped with an Emergency 
Communication Centre (ECC), Mobile Monitoring Control 
System (M2CS), and drone technology. PETRONAS was 
also among pioneering corporate organisations to deploy 
body-worn cameras at our headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia, thereby safeguarding our premises.
 Obtained certification for 81 identified 
personnel (73 APs and eight executives) as drone 
operators, aligned with the Civil Aviation 
Authority of Malaysia (CAAM) regulations.

Positive Social Impact


What Is Our Approach?
Identifying exposure to potential human rights risks and impacts, mitigating and addressing them are important in our 
operations. Salient potential human rights issues material to PETRONAS are:
Labour and Working 
Conditions
  Forced and trafficked 
labour in contractors’ and 
subcontractors’ workforce. 
 Child labour.
  Condition of employment 
and work.
  Discrimination in hiring 
and contractual terms. 
  Freedom of association 
and collective bargaining.
  Workers’ health and safety. 
  Workers’ camp conditions. 
Community Well-being
 Community health and 
safety. 
 Access to natural 
resources for health, 
cultural needs and 
livelihood.
 Land acquisition and 
involuntary resettlement 
with/without economic 
displacement.
 Indigenous peoples.
 In-migration.
Supply Chain
 Contractor/supplier 
performance related to 
labour and working 
conditions, community 
well-being and security.
Responsible Security
 Use of force and conduct 
of third-party security. 
 Provision of Human 
Rights training for staff 
and third-party security.
Our human rights approach is embraced and advanced by 
our leaders, with clear governance processes to ensure 
implementation and accountability. Our commitment is led 
from the top, our work in human rights is overseen by the 
PETRONAS Board and ELT.
The Board and ELT regularly discuss human rights as part 
of our approach to sustainability, reviewing issues with 
actual or potential impact, where a business-critical 
decision needs to be taken, or where substantial financial 
investment may be needed to address the impact.
Efforts to uphold human rights are integrated throughout 
our organisation and extend to our broader ecosystem, 
including suppliers, contractors, partners and the 
communities we serve.
Our Due Diligence
To minimise social risks and their impact on our 
employees, partners, contractors and communities, we 
have established technical standards and guidelines on 
due diligence that include assessments on indigenous 
peoples, cultural heritage, land acquisitions and involuntary 
settlement as well as grievance mechanism. Our Social 
Performance technical practitioners lead our due diligence 
programmes, identifying, mitigating, tracking, and 
monitoring potential human rights issues.
We also require human rights due diligence for potential 
mergers and acquisitions. As we transition to a low carbon 
future, we ensure our processes, tools, and practices 
remain updated and applicable in identifying how new 
energy infrastructure and developments impact human 
rights. We also share best practices with our supply chain 
partners to ensure the effective implementation of human 
rights due diligence.
Throughout 2022, there were no reported violations 
involving indigenous peoples’ rights. There was also no 
activity on land acquisition and involuntary resettlement.
As part of our policy, we do not practice discrimination 
on any grounds. We continuously conducted reviews, 
strengthened policies and practices to ensure employees 
rights on equality and non-discrimination were upheld.
There were no complaints of discrimination received in 
2022, based on our Industrial Relations data.
Access to Remedy
Grievance mechanisms create channels for dialogue, 
problem-solving and investigation and are applied to 
provide timely and fair remedies when needed. Workers 
and other rightsholders can raise complaints freely and 
with the expectation of obtaining effective and transparent 
resolutions. It also helps to identify country-specific 
solutions and actions to avoid recurrence.
Our grievance mechanism covers HSE, security, labour and 
working conditions, and supply chain concerns where we 
operate. We have designated personnel, community liaison 
officers and online complaint channels to manage grievances.
Additionally, PETRONAS contractors are required to 
establish a grievance mechanism for their workforce within 
our value chain. This mechanism shall be made known 
and communicated in relevant languages, providing a way 
to report grievances while ensuring that the identity of the 
person filing the grievance is protected. The grievance 
mechanism must adhere to the United Nation Guiding 
Principles (UNGP) ‘access to remedy’ pillar.
Positive Social Impact
Human Rights
Why Is It Important?
Respecting human rights is essential for our social license to operate. It is our responsibility to manage human rights 
risks and impacts arising from areas of our operations while contributing to society in a responsible, ethical and 
transparent manner.
PETRONAS is committed to respecting human rights in areas of our operations, complying with our Code of Conduct 
and Business Ethics (CoBE) and all relevant legal requirements. 
Respecting human rights across our value chain, inclusive of employees, suppliers, contractors, partners and 
communities where we operate is very important to PETRONAS in upholding our duty as a business enterprise. Human 
rights is the foundation of sustainable development and creating positive social impact comes with proper management 
of social risks. Upholding human rights through fair and ethical practices is fundamental to our business. It creates a 
safe and secure operating environment that complies with laws and regulations and meets the expectations of our 
stakeholders. Respecting human rights is also essential to achieve our purpose in being a progressive energy and 
solutions partner, enriching lives for a sustainable future. 
To support our Human Rights Commitment, we integrate controls throughout our systems and processes including risk 
management, procurement and supply chain, HSE, human resource management, business operations, legal and 
security. The following standards, policies and guidelines guide us:

We conducted several engagement sessions with our employees to raise awareness of the risks associated with child or 
forced labour practices. We also collaborated with the Department of Labour Peninsular Malaysia to share our initiatives 
and gain a deeper understanding of the revised regulations.
New Suppliers Screened Using Social Criteria
Under the PETRONAS Contractors 
Code of Conduct on Human Rights 
(CoCHR), we require our contractors to 
respect internationally-recognised 
human rights and comply with the 
PETRONAS Code of Conduct and 
Business Ethics (CoBE). We expect our 
contractors and suppliers to adhere to 
labour and working condition principles: 
freedom of labour, prevention of child 
labour, wages and benefits, working 
hours, grievance mechanism, non-
discrimination, freedom of association, 
humane treatment and foreign and 
migrant workers.
1. From 2018 to 2022, PETRONAS 
conducted CoCHR Self-
Assessments for identified new 
contracts and performed CoCHR 
Compliance Assessments based on 
the Self-Assessment results.
2. In 2022, the CoCHR survey was 
sent to 510 contractors.
3. Out of the 510 contractors, we 
identified 22 contractors with high 
risk exposure on human rights in 
2022 and we completed 100 per 
cent CoCHR compliance on those 
contractors to understand their 
situations and challenges. 
Generally their gaps were on 
informal grievance mechanism 
within their workforce and lack of 
grievance management within their 
supply chain.
Results from the online surveys conducted from 2019 – 2022 indicated that 
we managed to maintain more than 90 per cent awareness building among 
contractors for two consecutive years. Using CoBE as our baseline, the gap 
has narrowed to less than 5 per cent in 2021 and 2022, compared to about 
20 per cent in 2019 and 2020.

We continue to reinforce our commitment to human rights across our value chain, by assessing compliance on 
our Contractors Code of Conduct on Human Rights (CoCHR). The CoCHR is our supply chain due diligence on 
labour and working conditions, requiring ethical practices from our contractors in compliance with the PETRONAS 
Human Rights Commitment. We value contractors who share our commitment to integrity, anti-bribery and 
anti-corruption practices and sustainable development. Compliance with the CoCHR, including the principle of 
freedom of association and collective bargaining, is mandatory for all contractors. This requirement has been 
embedded into our procurement processes in Malaysia, where respect for human rights has become a contractual 
obligation for all goods and services providers who participate in our procurement process.

In 2022, we updated the PETRONAS CoBE to include 
a human rights section under Part III: Workplace, 
Culture, and Environment. The revised policy 
mandates all employees, contractors, partners and 
those involved in our operations to uphold the 
principles of respect for human rights and take 
measures to mitigate social and human rights risks, 
prohibit child labour, engage in or support human 
trafficking or modern slavery, including forced, 
bonded, or involuntary labour.

Sustained PETRONAS’ Commitment to Zero 
Forced Labour and Child Labour in Malaysia-
Based Supply Chain
We continue to uphold our pledge to eradicate 
forced and child labour in all our operations as part 
of our firm commitment to respecting human rights. 
We comprehensively assessed our contractors 
performing high-risk activities from 2019-2022 to 
ensure full compliance with our human rights 
policies and practices. Bureau Veritas Certification 
(M) Sdn Bhd, a third-party verifier, assessed our 
supply chain due diligence on qualitative and 
quantitative data related to our key performance 
indicators for the PETRONAS Contractor Code of 
Conduct on Human Rights (CoCHR). The results 
affirmed that PETRONAS has adequate supply chain 
due diligence, and there was no evidence of child 
or forced labour practices within our supply chain.
We found no incidents of child and forced labour in 
the reporting year. To further strengthen the 
awareness and understanding of risks related to child 
and forced labour among our employees, we have 
organised an engagement as well as a Masterclass on 
Forced and Child Labour on 5 July 2022, with a 
speaker from the International Labour Organisation 
(ILO), and a Masterclass on Standard and Industrial 
Research Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM) 501 Social 
Accountability Standard on 17 November 2022.  
Value Creation in 2022
These efforts were organised to promote and elevate 
our employees’ awareness and knowledge of child 
and forced labour risks. Understanding the child and 
forced labour indicators and why they are essential, 
ensures our employees can identify potential child 
and forced labour risks in their respective operations.

Strengthened Social Risk Assessment 
Implementation
An evaluation on the effectiveness of social risk 
assessment (SRA) implementation was conducted by 
sampling 20 per cent of total SRAs for the past five 
years. No deviations were found from our SRA technical 
standard, indicating effective implementation of the 
assessment process. Enhancements were also made to 
our digital SRA tool from the review, with an upgrade of 
the SRA documentation from guideline to standard.

Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) in India 
 
We reviewed the adequacy of controls to manage 
potential child and forced (bonded) labour risks in our 
operations across India. 
The risk of child or forced labour is low due to 
compliance with regulatory requirements, strict 
penalties, and limited activities for contractors in our 
facilities in India. We have recommended further 
improvements to minimise our risk exposure, as listed 
below:
• Enhancement of contractor management to 
include human rights awareness briefings, and 
fit-for-purpose contractor self-assessments on 
labour, potential collaborations with partners or 
within joint ventures (JVs) on respect for human 
rights initiatives, revision of Codes of Conduct and 
relevant processes to align with revised CoBE, 
assessment of adequacy of controls on forced or 
bonded labour risks across the value chain, as well 
as assessment of forced and child labour risks 
across key contractors and suppliers. 
• These include source material to comply with 
regulatory requirements such as the Factories Act 
1948, The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) 
Act 1986, Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976 
and The Payment of Minimum Wages Act 1948.

SIRIM 50 is a Malaysian social accountability standard that assesses an organisation’s compliance with health and safety 
regulations and Malaysian labour laws and ethical practices. It defines social accountability requirements consistent with those in 
other international social standards such as ISO 26000 and SA 8000.

Social Risk Assessment with Local Communities 
Social risk assessments were conducted throughout our 
projects and operations to ensure we could identify, 
assess and mitigate any social and human rights risks 
which may affect the communities where we operate.
In 2022, we conducted seven Social Risk Assessments at 
our projects and operations. Based on the findings, there 
were no significant actual and potential violations involving 
rights of the communities surrounding our operations.
Grievance Management 
Evaluation of Effectiveness of First Line Assurance
We have a Grievance Mechanism First Line Assurance (GM 
FLA) that acts as the first point of contact for resolving 
issues, thus addressing complaints swiftly and effectively.
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the grievance 
mechanism (GM) implementation was conducted by 
sampling 100 per cent of GM FLA. Results found that 97 
per cent of operating units comply with the GM 
requirements, with a 47 per cent increase in assurance 
implementation from 23 per cent in the previous year. 
First line assurance by the operating units
is risk-based.

All seven grievance cases were closed in 2022. The 
number of grievances do not necessarily describe the 
effectiveness of the system as it is the outreach, trust and 
confidence in the system that is critical to us.
The evaluation on the effectiveness of our grievance 
mechanism processes in 2022 shows positive results, and 
we also acknowledge that there is room to further 
encourage our rightsholders to continue using our GM 
channels towards managing potential risks and impacts to 
the community, employees and contractors where we 
operate.

Screening for a Sustainable Supply Chain 
PETRONAS’ suppliers and contractors are encouraged to embrace sustainability principles and be accountable for its 
implementation. 
Our suppliers are at various stages of implementing sustainability practices across their respective businesses. We 
provided our assistance through multiple engagements and training programmes to help them progress. 
We organised the 101 Sustainability Awareness session, in collaboration with Yinson Holdings Berhad and SOLS Energy 
Sdn Bhd to strengthen our vendors’ understanding and responsiveness towards sustainability. We conducted a second 
sustainability awareness session titled Shifting Towards Sustainability, later in the year in collaboration with our Strategic 
Research division, Sustainability Energy Development Authority (SEDA) and Kenanga Suria Sdn Bhd.

Simplifying Procurement with Technology
Our supply chain productivity and efficiency have been greatly enhanced through technology adoption. By digitising 
and automating our procurement process, we have been able to optimise our resources, reduce costs and effectively 
respond to disruptions. Our focus was process automation to enable contactless buying experience for low value 
purchasing activities.
As a result of these efforts, as well as internal cost optimisation and efficiency initiatives, we enabled local OGSE 
industry players to serve PETRONAS more efficiently while improving the pace of the end-to-end procurement process.
 342 participants attended 
the 101 Sustainability 
Awareness programme to

A Resilient and Agile Supply Chain is Essential for our Operations and Stakeholders. 
Supply Chain Management
Why Is It Important?
PETRONAS relies on a range of products and services 
throughout our value chain, sourced from a vast global 
network of suppliers. 
Ethical and sustainable supply chains aid in product 
development, safeguard workers’ rights, and enhance 
operational safety. We view our supply chain as an 
opportunity to contribute to positive socio-economic 
impacts. It allows us to channel financial capital into 
businesses, including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), 
empowering their growth in environmental protection, 
responsible sourcing and procurement practices.
What Is Our Approach?
Our suppliers must adhere to policies and standards in 
managing environmental and social impacts across our 
integrated oil and gas value chain. 
We have zero tolerance towards non-compliance, 
including our environmental and social standards. We 
conduct capacity building and engagement sessions to 
build capability and strengthen the resilience of the 
industry. To this end, we have been collaborating with 
nine financial institutions on the Vendor Financing 
Programme (VFP) to facilitate access to funding for 
vendors since 2018. We have also introduced Special Oil 
and Gas Services and Equipment (OGSE) Financing which 
targets underserved vendors with less than five years of 
experience. In driving sustainability, we partnered with 
industry players and government agencies by participating 
in the National OGSE Industry Blueprint roadshows in the 
Klang Valley, Sabah and Sarawak. We also participated in 
strategic forums such as the National OGSE Sustainability 
Forum.
We collaborated with OGSE industry players through our 
Vendor Development Programme (VDP) and SMEs to 
promote local entrepreneurship to contribute to socio-
economic growth and improve communities through an 
increase in employment opportunities.

Positive Social Impact


Why Is It Important?
Product stewardship is a vital aspect of ensuring that our 
products meet customer needs and sustainability 
considerations. When developing innovative products and 
solutions, we take a life cycle approach in meeting 
stakeholder expectations through minimising impact on 
health, safety and the environment throughout a product’s 
entire life cycle.
Product stewardship in PETRONAS comprises a range of 
cross-functional disciplines, including product safety and 
regulatory compliance, toxicology, ecotoxicology, 
environmental health, product sustainability and life cycle 
assessment. We also collaborate with stakeholders across 
extended product supply chains, going beyond compliance 
to improve our offerings, ensuring safer and sustainable 
products that are in line with customer preferences.
What Is Our Approach? 
We remain steadfast in our commitment to managing risks 
and enhancing the performance of our products across 
their entire life cycle. Our approach to Life Cycle Thinking 
ensures that we take comprehensive steps to 
systematically assess, control, and communicate product 
HSE risks. These elements are integrated into our 
operations, from R&D and raw material sourcing to 
manufacturing, distribution, product application, consumer 
use and disposal.
Product safety and risk assessments are regularly performed, 
updated when necessary and communicated in order to 
ensure we do our part in safeguarding the environment 
and enabling our products to have a positive social impact 
through responsible use and application. We conduct 
comprehensive raw material assessments and product Life 
Cycle Assessments (LCA) to add value to products by 
meeting emerging stakeholder expectations and managing 
future product risks effectively. These practices are 
embedded into our standards and systems to ensure 
robust and responsible governance processes are in place 
which enables continuous improvements to product 
stewardship performance. 
In addition to ensuring efficient procedures and effective 
communication with our partners and customers, we leverage 
digital and toxicology laboratory technology to safeguard our 
product compliance (licence to operate) in new markets, 
build customer loyalty and drive technical competency. Our 
commitment to managing product risks and enhancing 
performance is integral to our continued success.

Improving the Industry Through Our Supply Chain
As an integrated energy solutions provider, we play an important role in promoting Malaysia’s OGSE industry 
development, guided by the National OGSE Blueprint 2021-2030. This is to ensure we meet market demand, harness 
efficiency and drive innovation and opportunities for local companies to expand into new markets. The aim is to 
promote a healthy ecosystem, improve competitiveness on a global scale while safeguarding strategic national interests 
and contributing to the country’s economic growth. 
Our activities included hosting the Vendor Financing Programme (VFP) Conversation Day in collaboration with Malaysian 
Oil, Gas and Energy Services Council (MOGSC) and Malaysia OSV Owners’ Association (MOSVA) at Putrajaya to help 
develop Malaysian OGSE players by presenting opportunities for funding.

 Strengthening Product Safety and Regulatory 
Compliance Governance
Operating internationally through integrated supply 
chains with a broad spectrum of products poses its 
own unique challenges. We place importance on 
product safety and regulatory compliance governance 
to ensure alignment with PETRONAS’ overall 
objectives and aspirations. We have leveraged 
PETRONAS Group product stewardship situational 
assessments in order to:
• Identify areas of risk and enhance internal product 
stewardship standards with leading practices to 
ensure our products continue to be safe for 
intended use through evidence-based approaches. 
• Identify areas for simplification and/or optimisation 
in managing our product regulatory compliance 
processes, as evident in the roll-out of a dedicated 
emergency response number to ensure any 
product-related emergency calls are professionally 
managed, with adequate coverage internationally. 
5 
Raw Material Compliance 
As part of our efforts to drive product safety and 
sustainability, product raw material assessments have 
been identified as a key lever. With the introduction 
of our Raw Material Information Request (RAWMIR) 
process, key product stewardship information 
regarding presence of Substance of Very High 
Concern (SVHC) and conflict minerals1 have been 
curated for the majority of our products and specific 
cases for phase out or substitution have been 
initiated.
Due diligence on 250 raw materials used in PCG’s 
products revealed that no conflict minerals were 
supplied to PETRONAS. Efforts are ongoing to 
complete conflict minerals due diligence across the 
wider Downstream and Upstream businesses.
 
The RAWMIR process was also extended to Oil Field 
Chemicals (OFCs) in order to obtain key 
environmental performance related to the Offshore 
Chemical Notification Scheme (OCNS). Data 
pertaining to aquatic toxicity of OFCs was obtained to 
enhance our efforts to reduce risk from produced 
water discharges.
6 
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) 
 
 We continued to drive and embed Life Cycle Thinking 
across our businesses and operations, as well as for 
new projects and product development. The LCA 
approach was also used to quantify and prioritise the 
usage of low environmental impact raw material 
formulations, including formulating products with 
lower carbon footprint. This allowed us to capitalise 
on new business opportunities and generate income 
for PETRONAS.
 
 
We conducted a cradle-to-gate assessment, 
beginning from resource extraction (cradle) to the 
factory gate (before it is transported to the 
consumer). This approach is aligned with our 
integrated value chain, ranging from extraction to 
downstream product completion.
 
 Engagements with relevant stakeholders were 
conducted to encourage knowledge sharing on the 
concept of LCA and gain the necessary information to 
develop life cycle inventory data. In the absence of 
suppliers’ information, we leverage our experience in 
developing the PETRONAS LCA database.
1 In politically unstable areas, conflict mineral trade can be used to finance armed groups, fuel forced labour and other human rights 
abuses, and support corruption and money laundering. Conflict minerals are tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold (refer to EU Regulation 
2017/821).
Product Stewardship and Toxicology
Key Highlights of 2022

Operation Clean Sweep
Working closely with the Malaysian Plastics 
Manufacturers Association (MPMA), PETRONAS 
Chemical Polyethylene Sdn Bhd and PETRONAS 
Chemical LDPE Sdn Bhd officially registered our 
pledge under Operation Clean Sweep® (OCS) which 
is the global plastics industry initiative that aims to 
reduce polymer pellets, flake and powder loss to the 
environment. PETRONAS Chemicals Group Berhad 
(PCG) became the first OCS signatory in Malaysia, 
demonstrating our commitment to safeguard the 
environment in this important area by performing 
detailed onsite assessments and implementing 
solutions to prevent polymer loss to the environment. 
Recognising the importance of industry-wide 
participation, moving forward we endeavour to drive 
this important agenda by encouraging wider adoption 
of OCS within our polymer supply chain.
2 
 Establishing PETRONAS’ Maiden Toxicology 
Laboratory 
 
 We are establishing PETRONAS’ first toxicology 
laboratory to support R&D of safer and sustainable 
chemicals. The laboratory will enable early screening 
of key health and environmental hazards of candidate 
chemicals at pre-prototype stage. This will provide a 
feedback loop for product design improvement to 
create less hazardous products and minimise impact 
on the environment and human health. The 
laboratory emphasises non-animal test methods to 
ensure wider regulatory compliance as well as future 
regulatory preparedness.
3 
Ecotoxicology Assessments 
 
 We continuously assess the environmental performance 
of our products to promote the use of safer and 
sustainable chemicals. Data from internationally 
accepted and reliable ecological tests based on the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) test guidelines were utilised to 
improve relevant product hazard profiles.
 
 Produced water risk-based assessments continued to 
be conducted at our selected onshore terminals in 
order to address the ecological risk of discharged 
produced water on sensitive receptors in coastal and 
marine ecosystems.
36 LCA studies 
completed for products 
across Downstream and

Positive Social Impact


Creating an Inclusive Culture 
We remain focused on creating an intentionally inclusive 
culture. We do this by reinforcing the right behaviours and 
mindset to sustain an environment that will help us 
progress and accelerate our ability to deliver on our 
commitments. Our talent composition in 2022 comprised 
of 29 per cent women, which was an improvement from 
28 per cent in 2021. We employ over 100 nationalities 
and 40 per cent of our total population is aged 35 years 
and below.
Driving Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) 
Diverse ideas, views and backgrounds create a more 
progressive work environment which in turn delivers better 
outcomes. In creating an intentionally inclusive culture, we 
drive change through leadership and governance, 
communication, education and culture. 
1 
Leadership and Governance 
The Board of Directors approved our baseline and 
targets as we work towards more focused efforts on 
D&I. We are governed by requirements in areas where 
we operate and aim to seek and nurture local talents 
for senior management roles across the Group. 
We collaborate through reputable associations and 
organisations, such as the International Association of 
Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP), World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the World 
Economic Forum (WEF) to network and benchmark 
global practices of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
(DEI). In 2022, our Senior Vice President of Group 
Human Resource Management was assigned the role 
of Commissioner in the Business Commission to 
Tackle Inequality (BCTI) by WBCSD.
In ensuring diversity of thought at all levels, 
myTalentX was introduced in 2022 as a digital 
platform to identify potential leaders through a 
process of transparent and effective succession 
planning.
2 
Communication 
Strategic conversations with the Board were held on the 
topic of ‘Equity’. The conversations covered the 
foundation and fundamentals of Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion (DEI), leading best practices, priorities and 
commitment going forward on the matter. The Board 
were also updated on PETRONAS’ progress and efforts 
towards D&I.
3 
Education
The Conscious Inclusion Programme was rolled out 
to raise awareness on the importance of D&I to 
PETRONAS. We conducted engagement sessions with 
the Board and upskilled and trained more than 250 
PETRONAS leaders groupwide.
We launched e-Learning modules on Inclusive 
Mindset for middle managers and executives which 
were attended by 278 participants.
 282 employees received counselling with a total 
of 954 hours, a 15 per cent increase from 2021.
 70 per cent of employees who received counselling 
reported the therapy to have been effective.
 Digital coaching increased by 119 per cent from 
533 individual sessions in 2021 to 1,166 individual 
sessions in 2022. 
 Number of callers to the EAP Careline dropped 
14 per cent to 700 from the previous year’s 811.
Employee Well-being 
Why Is It Important?
Our people are our most valuable asset and their well-
being is our priority. As we recognise that a healthy 
work-life balance is essential for our employees’ 
productivity and job satisfaction, we encourage flexible 
work arrangements, provide access to wellness 
programmes and offer a range of other initiatives to 
promote employee well-being. By investing in our 
employees, we promote a more motivated and engaged 
workforce that is better equipped to contribute to our 
business success.
In addition to promoting employee well-being, we are 
also committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in our 
workplace. We believe that embracing diversity brings new 
perspectives, fresh ideas and a wealth of talent to our 
organisation. This allows us to tap into a wider pool of 
talent, foster innovation and improve decision-making. Our 
commitment to create an inclusive work environment 
where everyone feels valued, respected and supported will 
contribute to wider positive societal impact, and is also a 
key driver to our progress. A diverse and inclusive 
workplace is essential for creating value and driving 
sustainable growth.
What Is Our Approach?
We take the time to understand the unique needs of our 
employees and introduce relevant programmes anchored 
on PETRONAS Cultural Beliefs and Shared Values to create 
an environment where they can thrive and help us achieve 
our strategic priorities.
We believe that connecting with peers both within and 
outside their scope of work allows employees to nurture 
their professional and personal interests. We encourage 
participation in various clubs, company-wide initiatives and 
volunteering activities that contribute to a positive workplace 
culture — instilling a sense of belonging, safety, passion 
and purpose over the long term.
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is guided by 
the PETRONAS Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) programmes, 
focusing on four key areas: gender, multinational, age and 
culture. Meanwhile, our Wellness Steering Committee 
oversees employee health and well-being, including 
mental health. 
PETRONAS also has processes and controls in place to 
ensure we comply with applicable wage laws. We 
conducted market analysis to ensure competitive 
compensation. In Malaysia, compensation is on average, 
20 per cent above minimum wage thresholds. 
Value Creation in 2022 
Empowering People through Flexibility
Flexible Working Arrangement (FlexiWork)
We introduced FlexiWork to allow our people to balance 
between their professional and personal commitments, 
ultimately being their best selves while delivering for the 
organisation. We put in place safety measures to ensure a 
smooth back-to-office transition for our employees post 
COVID-19 pandemic. We reinforced awareness on the 
existing FlexiHours and FlexiWear that complement the 
current FlexiWork Arrangement.
We also established the PETRONAS Work Hub to enable 
employees who work either from home or the office to 
access information on best practices, digital tools and 
available support to help them sustain and where 
necessary improve their productivity levels. Consistent 
communication was also carried out on COVID-19 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure the safety 
of our employees and those that they encountered, at 
work and at home. 
Caring for Our People’s Support System
Employee Assistance Programme (EAP)
The EAP named myFriends was launched together with 
our MESTIFit4Health wellness programme in 2017 as part 
of PETRONAS’ effort to care for the welfare of our people 
by providing psychological interventions to build personal 
resilience, reduce emotional distress and destigmatise 
mental health issues. In 2021, Enhanced EAP or EAP 2.0 
was introduced, integrating our EAP with advances in 
psychology and coaching programmes via a digital 
platform accessible all day with comprehensive 
multidisciplinary support by digital physical and mental 
health care provider, Naluri Hidup Sdn Bhd to employees 
and sponsored students globally. 
We extended the EAP 2.0 in 2022 to family members to 
help them cope with their mental well-being as an 
important measure to support our employees’ overall 
health and performance.
4 
Culture
In strengthening a culture of D&I, we rolled out the 
D&I module via the PETRONAS e-Survey to encourage 
employees to speak up on the topic. We conducted a 
forum on building an inclusive workforce featuring 
internal and external speakers. It was attended by 
1,600 employees virtually and in-person.
We introduced myCareerX, an integrated HR platform 
that enables employees to take charge of their own 
career journey. The platform promotes transparency 
within the organisation and gives employees equal 
opportunities to explore other roles available across 
PETRONAS. This allows for a more diverse and 
inclusive talent pool as we work towards developing 
the workforce of the future.

continued to bridge the gender gap across our 
business and operations. We collaborated with 
industry players by leveraging the Malaysian Women 
in Energy (MyWiE) network to host a sponsorship 
programme with university students. Through this 
programme, three PETRONAS leaders participated in 
the Speed Mentoring and panellist session at the 
Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) Asia 2022, 
and five representatives joined the Women in Energy 
Reception hosted by the United States (US) Embassy.
We initiated conversations on careers in the energy 
industry by taking part in the Women’s Global 
Leadership Conference on Energy (WGLC).
We also believe in the value that neurodivergent 
individuals can bring to the organisation, hence we 
intend to create a robust ecosystem to engage and 
retain neurodiverse talent and tap into their full 
potential for PETRONAS’ growth.
We foster a sense of belonging among our 
employees through the establishment of various clubs 
and associations within the organisation. Through 
clubs such as the PETRONAS Sports and Recreation 
Club (KSRP), Association for Wives and Women Staff 
of PETRONAS (PETRONITA) and the Young 
Professionals Club (YPC), activities catering to diverse 
interests are organised and carried out.
Cultivating the Right Behaviour and Mindset
We recognise that resilience is a key factor that will help 
us overcome our future challenges. Therefore, it is 
important to reinvigorate and improve the way we do 
things, bravely expanding beyond our traditional business 
areas, guided by our Statement of Purpose, Shared Values 
and PETRONAS Cultural Beliefs.

PETRONAS Organisational Culture Survey (POCS) 
We actively listen to the voices of our employees through 
POCS, where employees were given the opportunity to 
provide feedback about the organisation. It also helps 
to identify challenges that hinder high performance. 
The response rate for POCS 2022 was 90 per cent.

Top Leaders Dialogue (TLD)
Recognising that the right behaviour and mindset start 
at the top, the Top Leaders Dialogue (TLD) sessions 
were conducted to facilitate continuous engagement, 
alignment and collaboration on business direction. We 
collaborated with the PETRONAS Leadership Centre 
(PLC) to conduct several sharing sessions with well 
known industry thought leaders to enhance the 
enterprise perspective of 180 of our top leaders 
comprising senior general managers and above.

Continuous Improvement (CI) Mindset
The Continuous Improvement (CI) mindset is an 
essential component in sustaining our presence as a 
Fortune Global 500® company, and needs to be 
embedded in our people’s mindset and behaviours as 
we progress. We focused on streamlining our business 
processes through simplification to drive performance.

Positive Social Impact


Our aim is to redefine the talent experience by focusing on people, processes and platforms. We want to create an 
empowered, agile and enabled workforce that can make meaningful progress and have a sustainable impact. To 
achieve this, we focus on developing future skills in areas such as analytics, sustainability and digitalisation. We also 
encourage our employees to take charge of their career progression by enhancing relevant talent management 
principles and processes.
In developing future talents, we provide education sponsorships to students as well as industrial and technical training 
opportunities for new graduates. We offer talented young people learning opportunities at our industry-recognised 
learning institutions such as Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP), Institut Teknologi Petroleum PETRONAS (INSTEP) and 
Akademi Laut Malaysia (ALAM) that provide energy industry-related curriculum and training programmes.
Value Creation in 2022 
Existing Talent
For our existing talents in the company, we focused on the 
five key Capability Development Priorities, supported by our 
in-house learning institutions and platforms, enhanced talent 
ecosystem and a sustainable pool of leaders.
Sustainability 
We scaled up efforts in building our people’s knowledge 
and capabilities in the area of sustainability to accelerate 
our ability to deliver our NZCE 2050 Pathway and fortify 
trust among stakeholders.
Sustainability Capability Development Framework 
The Sustainability Capability Development Framework was 
developed as part of our efforts to equip employees with 
sustainability-related knowledge, practices and processes. 
We also identified learning pathways and priorities for 
leaders and top talents, functional sustainability 
practitioners and the broader employee population.
Advancing Sustainability Conversations 
Engagement with Leaders
We engaged leaders through conversations to raise 
awareness on the need for change and to improve 
understanding of how the organisation’s performance 
can be enhanced. 
We engaged with members of the PETRONAS Board and 
the Board of Directors of our public-listed companies to 
help oversee sustainability-driven strategies and guide 
stakeholder-oriented long-term goals. Executive leaders 
received guidance in developing a strategic direction that 
is aligned to organisational purpose, strategy and business 
models that contribute towards society and the 
environment. 
One of the Top Leaders Dialogue sessions in 2022 
featured the launch of our NZCE 2050 Pathway and 
provided our leaders with greater clarity on sustainability 
challenges and targets. As a result of this dialogue, leaders 
felt more engaged, aligned, inspired and united in 
purpose.
On a global level, we also took part in sustainability 
conversations and leadership programmes provided through 
our membership in the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development (WBCSD), a network of around 
200 leading companies committed to advancing sustainable 
business practices.
Improving Sustainability Knowledge and Skillsets 
Colleagues from across the Group benefitted from a range 
of learning opportunities made available to enhance 
relevant knowledge and functional skills to drive and 
shape future sustainability practices.
 101 employees completed training programmes 
on sustainability delivered by the Cambridge 
Institute of Sustainability Leadership, Yale School 
of Management, Harvard Kennedy School, 
Institute of Management Development and Centre 
for Sustainability and Excellence.
 132 sustainability change agents were appointed.
 84 employees were upskilled with Level 1 
Methane Emissions knowledge.
 289 employees including top leaders, have 
attended sustainability masterclasses.
We also carried out awareness-building initiatives for all 
employees to ensure they were able to apply the 
knowledge obtained on sustainability, its drivers, tools and 
approaches in their daily actions. Towards this end, a 
sustainability e-learning module was also made 
compulsory for all new hires.
Talent and Future Pipeline
Why Is It Important?
We are currently in the midst of an era of energy transition, which is predominantly driven by the need to transform 
the global energy system for a low carbon future. To capitalise on opportunities that the transition brings, our most 
valuable asset – our diverse group of talented employees – must be equipped with skills, capabilities and experience 
that are relevant for the future.
As competition for talent increases, we are focused on transforming our workforce to be ready to achieve our strategic 
priorities, including delivery of our Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050) Pathway. By empowering and 
nurturing existing and potential talents, we can create a more equitable and sustainable future and contribute to 
economic growth, while positioning ourselves as a preferred employer in the industry.
What Is Our Approach?
We believe in upholding a high-performance culture, where we attract and retain talents with critical skills and offer 
opportunities for upskilling and reskilling. We recognise that our employees are crucial for business sustainability and we 
want to ensure that they are equipped with the right skills, mindset and behaviour; hence, we invested RM264 million 
in employee training and development in 2022.
Our five key Capability Development Priorities for developing our people to meet evolving needs are:
Sustainability
• Elevate sustainability practices by expanding awareness programmes.
• Equip or acquire talents with technical expertise to embed sustainability into decision-
making and daily operations.
Continuous 
Improvement (CI), 
Agile and 
Innovation
• Agile and Innovation skills to ideate, incubate and scale new ideas. Continuous 
Improvement (CI) play a big role in delivering business results to maximise cash flow and 
improve efficiency.
Digital
• Accelerate digital solutions through digital literacy programmes.
• Equip or acquire talents with technical expertise in automation and advanced analytics to 
improve productivity, enable better decision-making and utilise data for competitive 
advantage.
Technical and 
Functional
• Technical and functional capabilities needed to grow our businesses.
• Equip or acquire talents with expanded technical and functional expertise.
Leadership
• Nurture leadership at all levels to ensure talents deliver desired results expected from their 
roles, establishing a robust and sustainable succession plan for driving Core and Growth 
business respectively.

culture, learning modules and engagements are seeded 
into key activities, events and digital platforms such as the 
Knowledge Series, information sessions, Venture Build 
Fireside chats, and exhibitions throughout the year. 
Shaping a Digitally-Competent Workforce 
In our efforts to shape a digitally-competent workforce, 
we conducted upskilling sessions and introduced tools, 
techniques and methodologies on analytics that can be 
applied to better solve business pain points and improve 
day-to-day operations.
 More than 100 ideas were registered from 
Innovation Masterclasses, with more than 30 
high potential opportunities progressing into 
Incubation and Venture Build stages.

Digital
Digitalisation and technology play a heavy role in our 
transition towards net zero carbon emissions. We 
recognise that the future of work will involve increased 
cross-functional collaborations and automation to improve 
productivity and decision-making, supported by data to 
drive competitive advantage. Therefore, we need to equip 
our employees and acquire new talents with the right 
technical depth, tools and methodologies in automation 
and advanced analytics to harness value from digital 
solutions.
Collaboration with Industry Players
We collaborated with Microsoft and Tata Consultancy 
Services to share new perspectives in our Knowledge 
Series webinars. We strengthened our position in the 
digital segment over the long term, partnering with 
Accenture to develop a customer-centric approach to 
building digital products. We also co-hosted the Amazon 
Web Services (AWS) User Group Meet-Up, where we 
extended our PETRONAS Cloud Community of Practice

Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak, Sabah, Labuan 
including Kesatuan Pekerja-pekerja Optimal 
Chemicals Malaysia Sdn Bhd (KEPKO), attended 
our sustainability-themed engagements and 
information sessions.
Agile 
In response to the dynamic pace of change experienced 
across the energy industry, we intensified efforts to 
develop more agile capabilities through our Agile 
Leadership and Capability Programmes. This will enable 
our people to ideate, incubate and scale new ideas and 
deliver customer solutions at pace.
As part of our goal to strengthen talent capabilities, we 
continued to enhance the Agile Coaching Enablement 
(ACE) programme by integrating it into the PETRONAS 
Leadership Centre to improve agile-based knowledge 
and application. We also strengthened the agile 
leadership platform by improving exposure to outside-in 
good practices on business agility through key 
engagements and learning programmes. In addition, we 
infused agile leadership topics into key leadership 
programmes and engagements such as the Top Leaders 
Dialogue sessions.
Continuous Improvement (CI), Agile and Innovation
We believe that being agile and innovative are critical 
factors in realising our transition towards a low carbon 
future. At the same time, we also need to effectively drive 
business performance and maximise cash flows. 
Continuous Improvement (CI)
As a business entity, we continue to equip our people with 
the right knowledge, methodologies, skills and mindset to 
understand and improve our current business processes. 
This will ensure sustainable operations and cost efficiency 
in meeting customer needs and business objectives.
Since PETRONAS Lean Six Sigma (PLSS) was introduced in 
2016, production performance has become more 
sustainable, with reduced cost, increased productivity and 
enhanced customer satisfaction. We have upskilled more 
than 11,000 employees on CI Awareness and developed 
almost 2,000 PLSS practitioners.
The PLSS process is subject to an annual Maturity 
Assessment to sustain the deployment of LSS across the 
organisation. In 2022, six operating units reached the 
status of PLSS Matured Organisation, namely Project 
Delivery and Technology (PD&T), Malaysian Refining 
Company Sdn Bhd (MRCSB), Global HR Services (GHRS), 
Engen Limited, Malaysia LNG Sdn Bhd (MLNG) and 
PETRONAS Chemicals Methanol (PC Methanol).
 143 PLSS improvement projects were executed.
 Saved 216,821 manhours.
 Over 4,000 employees upskilled in CI Awareness.
 299 practitioners were certified in PLSS: 228 
Yellow Belts, 66 Green Belts, five Black Belts.
 185 practitioners were trained in PLSS: 148 Green 
Belts, 31 Black Belts and six Master Black Belts.
 Achieved 57.77 per cent Process Cycle Efficiency (PCE).
Nurturing Innovative Capabilities
We continued to strengthen our employees’ capabilities 
in order to build an innovation ecosystem across the 
Group. Taking advantage of the rapid progress made in 
building the foundation for innovation in 2021, the 
PETRONAS Working Backwards (PWB) Methodology and 
innovation framework was expanded to business 
divisions in PETRONAS and the Innovation Masterclass 
was established as a permanent offering at the 
PETRONAS Leadership Centre (PLC). 
As a result, innovation practitioners are actively ideating 
and incubating high potential projects, contributing to 
the innovation opportunity funnel and boosting new 
business possibilities for growth in Core and New 
Business areas.

Powering Innovation
We recognise the need to change the way we think and 
work as an organisation as we navigate towards a just 
transition. Towards this end, we have created an 
ecosystem where ideas are incubated, tested and scaled 
to market by supporting key PETRONAS innovation 
initiatives, namely PETRONAS Innovation Garage (PING), 
SEEd.Lab and FutureTech Accelerator.
Driving Sustainability 
In line with our net zero carbon emissions 2050 pathway 
commitments, PLC serves as a platform to upskill leaders 
in sustainability and at the same time build sustainability 
advocacy across the organisation, from the environmental 
and human capital perspectives. We have also designed 
and built a new campus to drive our sustainability efforts.
PLC hosted
500
leaders on 
sustainability 
matters via 
various 
engagements 
throughout the 
year
PLC also hosted several key events, namely the 
PETRONAS Race2Decarbonise Hackathon and a roundtable 
forum on Road to COP27: Alignment on Energy Sector 
Decarbonisation to support National Narratives on Net 
Zero GHG Aspirations, with the Malaysian Government’s 
Economic Planning Unit (EPU) to demonstrate our strong 
commitment in lowering our carbon footprint in support 
of Malaysia’s environmental agenda. 
Sustainability Efforts at PLC 
Aligned with PETRONAS’ approach to sustainability, PLC’s 
campus is built with a green vision. It is environmentally 
responsive with energy-saving architecture as well as 
green and digital technologies in place. Our campus has

Biodiversity
• Total area of 35 acres (including lakes, streams and 
landscapes) to provide habitats for flora and fauna 
such as indigenous plants, butterflies and 
dragonflies.
• 2,160 trees planted, which can potentially absorb 
64.8 tCO2e equivalent to the amount of carbon 
dioxide produced by 127  air conditioners running 
for a year.
 
Wastewater Management
i. Greywater
• Wastewater generated from hand-washing basins 
is collected, filtered and used for toilet flushing, 
which reduces water demand and costs.
ii. Rainwater Harvesting Tank
• Rainwater is stored in four storage tanks with a 
maximum storage capacity of 1,368 m3 and is 
used for landscape irrigation. This capacity can 
wash up to 228,000 linen bedsheets.
 
Waste Management
• A maximum of 150,124 kg of food waste per year 
can be fed into a vessel composting system. This 
generates an estimated 10,509 kg of compost per 
year that may be used as fertiliser for PLC’s 
landscape.
 
Reduction of Heat Island Effect
• Man-made lake with water volume of 14,203 m3 
(equivalent to approximately 5.7 Olympic-sized 
swimming pools), reduces the air temperature 
surrounding the building.
• Main building facade is orientated north-south to 
minimise solar heat gain.
 
Energy Generation
• 4,066 photovoltaic (PV) panels installed to generate 
an estimated 2.3 million kWh/year, equivalent to 
the ability to power up 327 double-storey houses 
per year.
 
Daylight Harvesting and Glare Control
• Reduce reliance on artificial lighting through 
specially designed glass panels which are 
strategically placed for optimum natural light.
• High performance glazing to reduce energy 
consumption through the building envelope.
 
Electric Vehicle (EV) Chargers
• 17 Gentari EV charging points are available at PLC.
 
Health and Well-being
• Open spine area allows for well-ventilated social 
spaces.
• Use of MERV 13 rated air filters for better indoor 
air quality. 
• Selection of Low Volatile Organic Compounds 
(VOCs) paints and adhesives.
• CO2 sensors to maintain the quality of fresh air 
within air-conditioned building environment.
 
Efficient Systems
• Air Conditioning and Mechanical Ventilation (ACMV) 
system with high system co-efficient performance.
• Lighting system with automated light (lux) sensors 
and motion sensors.
Technical and Functional
We focused on strengthening the foundational capabilities 
of our people in our efforts to further grow our traditional 
portfolio of oil and gas, as well as prepare them in our 
pursuit of non-traditional growth to ensure PETRONAS’ 
long-term survivability. To achieve this, we aim to increase 
our capability strength to 75 per cent by 2025.
 Recorded a 62.5 per cent capability bench strength 
for Technical Skill Group (SKG) and 40.4 per cent 
for Business SKG.
We recognise that capability building is especially 
important for our new businesses such as Renewable 
Energy; carbon capture and storage (CCS); and Remote 
Autonomous Operations (RAO). As such, we continued to 
upskill our people via formal learning and On-the-Job 
learning (OJL).
Various upskilling programmes were also conducted and 
tailored to the needs of the respective businesses as we 
continued to develop our people in strengthening our 
core business. Programmes included Multi-Skill 
Acceleration Programmes for technical non-executives 
from the Upstream business and digital marketing for the 
marketing and trading teams from the Downstream and 
Gas businesses, while Project Delivery and Technology 
(PD&T) employees were provided training based on our 
new focus areas. A Capability Development Framework 
review was conducted for Risk Management fraternity 
while Finance saw the establishment of the Finance 
Academy, a structured learning platform to strengthen 
core or niche skills in support of new business areas. 
Leadership Development
Continuous development of leaders at all levels is essential 
in creating a robust talent pipeline and sustainable bench 
strength for effective succession. Working with reputable 
partners, we focused on three key areas to develop 
leadership skills, equipping senior leaders to lead and steer 
the workforce towards achieving organisational goals, 
continuously building a pipeline of leaders and supporting 
competency upskilling or reskilling programmes and new 
ways of working for talents. 
In-house Learning Institutions and Platform
We continued to accelerate capability development by 
leveraging our specialised learning institutions namely the 
PETRONAS Leadership Centre (PLC), Institut Teknologi 
Petroleum PETRONAS (INSTEP), the Centre for Advanced 
and Professional Education at Universiti Teknologi 
PETRONAS (CAPE UTP), Akademi Laut Malaysia (ALAM), as 
well as the myLearningX virtual learning platform. In 
creating a future-relevant workforce, these learning 
institutions and platforms provide opportunities for our 
talents to be upskilled on leadership and the energy 
industry as a whole.
PETRONAS Leadership Centre (PLC)
The PETRONAS Leadership Centre (PLC), previously known 
as PERMATA when it was established in 1989, was created 
to develop progressive leaders that would not only make 
an impact on our organisation, but also the global energy 
industry. The new PLC campus was completed in 2022.
Developing and Nurturing Leaders 
The programmes at PLC are designed to equip leaders 
with the skills and knowledge required to tackle the most 
pressing challenges faced across their diverse functions 
and industries. Towards this end, we ensure that our 
content is consistently relevant and delivered via the latest 
learning and development practices.

Talent Ecosystem 
We empower and enable our people to drive their career 
progression through a robust talent ecosystem.
In 2022, we continued to enhance our principles and 
processes, particularly in the areas of employee 
performance management, career progression and 
personal marketability, all of which are supported by an 
integrated HR platform called myCareerX.
Refreshed Employee Performance Management 
(EPM)
We refreshed our EPM for the wholesome development of 
our employees and an enhanced end-to-end talent 
journey for them by nurturing a growth mindset and 
behaviour. The refreshed EPM aligns performance 
objectives with individual aspirations, commits employees 
to roles and responsibilities with the needed competencies 
and promotes a self-driven culture based on continuous 
feedback and coaching. 
The refreshed EPM via myCareerX has enabled easy 
access for our employees and their managers to monitor 
performance and facilitate continuous performance 
conversations.
We also enhanced the Underperformer Management 
system to proactively carry out early intervention for 
identified employees.
We changed the PETRONAS Cultural Beliefs Behaviour 
Evaluation (BePCB) Guidelines into a 360-degree 
evaluation from the earlier 180-degree version. With this 
change, our employees’ direct managers and team 
members were able to give feedback, as well as managers 
and members from other teams whom they have worked 
with.
We also embedded open and transparent values in BePCB 
to encourage employees to speak up in performance-
related conversations, with a focus on learning and 
development aspects.
Enhanced Career Progression Principles 
We introduced our enhanced career progression principles 
in late 2021, which enables role-based progression 
anchored on competency, and a simplified decision-
making process from 2022 onward.
We initiated a pilot programme within the Human 
Resource fraternity, focusing on the following areas:
• Enabling our people to progress within and across roles 
while balancing business and talent needs, in line with 
matching employees’ aspirations with organisational 
goals.
• Promoting competency-based progression through 
fit-for-purpose assessments, with performance managed 
through EPM.
• Simplifying the decision-making process by empowering

PETRONAS Education Sponsorship Programme for 
Postgraduates (PESP²)
The PETRONAS Education Sponsorship Programme for 
Postgraduates (PESP2) is an extension of PESP, serving as a 
platform for deserving students to strengthen their 
knowledge and capability through postgraduate studies in 
specific key areas that support PETRONAS’ growth 
strategies.
Since its inception in 2018, 83 scholars have benefitted 
from the programme in various areas of expertise such as 
Drilling, Fluid Tech Solutions, Autonomous System 
(Robotics), Renewable Energy and Carbon Capture.
 Invested over RM4 million, benefitting 
20  recipients.
Industrial Training Programmes 
We provide industrial training opportunities for graduates 
and tertiary students through the Graduate Employability 
Enhancement Scheme (GEES) and internship programmes 
for on-the-job learning (OJL). These will help prepare 
students for better employment opportunities which would 
contribute towards improving their standard of living 
ultimately contributing to the socio-economic upliftment 
of the community.
Graduate Employability Enhancement Scheme 
(GEES)
GEES provides graduates with actual working experience 
as part of our soft skills training programme, in support of 
the Malaysian government’s Protégé Ready-to-Work 
initiative. It is a 12-month on-the-job training that aims to 
enhance the employability of new graduates towards 
securing long-term employment. We do this by instilling 
positive work attributes, including entrepreneurial training 
to encourage them to establish and manage their own 
business. We also provide technical bridging training to 
upskill students in relevant technical skills to facilitate their 
transition into the job market.
Since its inception in 2011, the programme has benefitted 
4,683 participants.
PETRONAS Internship Opportunity Programme 
We provide undergraduate students with industry experience 
and learning under our internship programme where they 
are able to gain knowledge outside of their academic 
setting. Our aim is to enable students to integrate theories 
and knowledge obtained from learning institutions and 
actual work situations in a professional manner. 
Through this programme, students will gain their first 
working exposure in the energy industry and the 
opportunity to engage across various operational areas. 
This enables them to put their learning into action and 
equip themselves with useful skills upon joining the 
workforce.
We invested over 
RM30 
million in 2022 to 
train 1,760 
new graduates 
under our GEES 
programme.
1,403
students from local and 
international universities 
participated in our internship
programme.

insights on talent, succession planning and position 
requirements across PETRONAS, leveraging AI-enabled 
recommendations to identify best fit talents as successors 
for key positions. In addition, myTalentX provides real-time 
data on top talent for faster decision-making in meeting 
business demands. 
 Close to 20,000 employees were able to 
access Talent Profile to build their 
personal marketability.
 Over 10,000 users have used the Talent 
Profile to update their personal 
information and explore potential roles.
 Talent Profile was intentionally used for 
talent deliberation in PETRONAS.

have benefitted in areas such as Economics and Mechanical 
Engineering at University of California, Berkeley, University 
College London and Imperial College London.
During their undergraduate years, PESP scholars undergo
a structured development programme via the PETRONAS
Readiness for Employment Programme (PREP) to ensure
they are continuously nurtured until graduation. Students
are also given the opportunity to interact with our leaders
to inspire and help them achieve their potential.
 Invested more than RM174 million through 
education sponsorships awarded to 587 Malaysian 
students.
 64 per cent of our scholars were recruited to 
work for the organisation upon graduation.
 Seven per cent of our graduates were recruited 
by other companies. 
 Five engagement sessions between scholars and 
PETRONAS leaders were conducted both locally 
and internationally to inspire students to push 
their potential towards success. 
Enhancing Personal Marketability via Talent 
Profile 
We encourage our people to drive their own talent 
journey within the organisation. With this in mind, we 
introduced Talent Profile in myCareerX, which is a digital 
resume to allow our employees to be visible within the 
organisation, market themselves and attract managers and 
team leaders who are looking to build their team.

Community Engagement
Why Is It Important?
Active engagement and community development are 
essential for building trust, establishing goodwill and 
maintaining positive relationships with the communities 
where we operate. By engaging with local communities 
and stakeholders, we understand their needs, reduce 
conflicts and minimise the risk of project delays or 
cancellations. This demonstrates our commitment to 
sustainable operations and nurtures a positive reputation. 
Investing in local communities stimulates economic 
growth, improves quality of life and creates a more 
supportive environment for our business. Building strong 
partnerships creates shared value contributing to our 
overall success and sustainability.
What Is Our Approach?
At PETRONAS, we are committed to building strong, 
resilient and empowered communities through community 
engagement efforts. Our initiatives aim to improve the 
standard of living, enhance livelihoods, promote equitable 
growth and increase environmental awareness. We take a 
structured and systematic approach by developing a 
community engagement strategy that aligns with our 
business objectives and values while addressing the needs 
and aspirations of surrounding communities. Our Social 
Impact programmes focus on education, community 
well-being and development, and the environment, to 
encourage sustainable livelihoods and equip communities 
with the necessary skills for a just energy transition, a fair 
and inclusive process that aims to ensure no one is left

Value Creation in 2022 
Education – PETRONAS Powering Knowledge
Quality education is a fundamental building block for creating a strong workforce, empowering communities and 
supporting the nation’s socio-economic growth. To this end, we have developed a range of programmes that cater to 
students from primary to tertiary levels, as well as the general public, with a focus on Science, Technology, Engineering 
and Mathematics (STEM). We have also initiated programmes to improve educational and vocational opportunities for all.
In 2019, we set a target to achieve 24,100 beneficiaries from PETRONAS’ Educational Programmes by 2024. This was in 
line with our objective to provide access to quality education, as well as strengthening teachers’ capability in STEM and 
to serve as role models in enhancing higher order thinking skills through STEM which enables communities to progress 
collectively as a nation. In 2022, we managed to achieve the target two years ahead of schedule, reaching 42,839 
education beneficiaries cumulatively from 2020 to 2022. The education programmes include our PETRONAS Education 
Sponsorship Programme (PESP), Program Duta Guru (Teacher Ambassador programme) and the Vocational Institution 
Sponsorship and Training Assistance (VISTA) programme, among others. Moving forward, we aim to continue providing 
better opportunities with sustainable impact to underprivileged students, and are in the process of developing other 
Social Impact measurement systems. We will be focusing on high impact initiatives through strategic partnerships and 
collaborations, and aspire to include more beneficiaries both domestically and internationally, especially in the areas 
where we operate.

Breaking the Cycle of Poverty Among Malaysia's 
Indigenous Communities and Extreme Poor
PETRONAS collaborates with a dedicated government 
department for the indigenous community (Orang Asli), 
Jabatan Kemajuan Orang Asli (JAKOA) and NGOs for a 
programme aiming to uplift the lives of Orang Asli across 
Malaysia. The programme focuses on providing access to 
clean energy, clean water and education.
In 2022, installing solar power systems under the 
programme impacted 156 Orang Asli homes across six 
villages. Each household benefitted from six hours of 
additional electricity and light per night, adding six hours 
of productivity which the community can spend on their 
daily routines such as domestic chores and other 
community activities. The installations have also reduced 
the community's energy expenses to approximately RM400 
per month for each home. They previously purchased 
diesel fuel generator sets for their power supply. 
As of 31 December 2022, more than 232,000 productivity 
hours were achieved from the installations and a savings 
of RM406,152.
The programme was expanded in 2022 to include access 
to clean water and learning programmes. The pilot 
solar-powered filtration systems were completed in 
Kampung Gakuyah in Bera, Pahang. Three units of the 
system provide clean water to 12 homes for each unit. 
Access to clean water protected the community from 
waterborne diseases, reducing their healthcare expenses 
and improved the mortality rate among children. It also 
increased the community's awareness of personal hygiene 
and healthy living. 
Meanwhile, a pilot learning programme was completed in 
Kampung Kepong in Bentong, Pahang. This programme is 
ready to be scaled-up further in in 2023.
 The programme was expanded in 2022 to include 
access to clean water and learning programmes.

Environment – PETRONAS Planting Tomorrow 
We recognise that achieving environmental awareness is a 
continuous journey that requires collective action. 
Therefore, we constantly work with our local communities 
to support environmental conservation and minimise our 
impact on the environment. 
Environmental Conservation 
Through Yayasan PETRONAS, we contributed towards 
carbon sequestration via tree planting activities. We did 
this by working with local communities in 11 states 
namely Kedah, Penang, Perak, Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, 
Melaka, Johor, Terengganu, Pahang, Sabah and Sarawak, 
where we provided them with the appropriate education, 
supported the setting-up of nurseries, participated in 
planting activities and monitored the survival of the trees. 
These actions help in improving the community’s income 
levels and quality of life.
 Continued to support environmental conservation 
under the PETRONAS Walk4Trees Challenge, a 
nationwide tree-planting project. A total of 61,584 
trees have been planted across 11 states since this 
project began in September 2020. 
 Three peat swamp forests in Selangor, Sabah and 
Pahang were rehabilitated and irrigation control 
management was implemented as part of fire 
prevention.
 
We conducted the mangrove conservation programmme 
in Johor and Terengganu. In Johor, it was carried out in 
support of the Johor State Government’s plan to develop 
Sungai Johor Estuary into an ecotourism attraction by 
planting 14,500 mangrove trees. In Terengganu, this was 
part of PCG’s conservation and rehabilitation awareness 
programme along Sungai Kertih. The programme covers 
more than 14,000 square metres, with over 20,000 
mangrove trees planted. 
Biodiversity efforts:
 We are also doing various conservation efforts to prevent and minimise impacts to 
biodiversity and the ecosystem, while restoring and rehabilitating the ecosystems 
surrounding where we operate.
 
Our Upstream business planted over 15,000 trees, including mangroves, converted shipwrecks 
into artificial reefs, conducted coral restoration works and deployed mini unjam, a fish aggregating 
device, to provide alternative breeding grounds for marine life, especially fish. These efforts 
helped improve the marine ecosystem services to ensure food security, sustainable economic 
and coastal livelihood development (ecotourism) and shoreline protection.
Beach Cleaning Activities
We collaborated with several Non-Governmental 
Organisations (NGOs) and government ministries to 
clean up beaches. In Melaka, as part of our participation 
in World Clean-Up Day, we partnered with Solid Waste 
and Public Cleansing Management Corporation 
(SWCorp), the city council, Majlis Bandaraya Melaka 
Bersejarah (MBMB), and the state’s legislative assembly 
development and coordination committee, Jawatankuasa 
Pembangunan dan Penyelarasan Dewan Undangan 
Negeri (JAPERUN). 
The collaborative effort saw 100.2 kilogrammes of waste 
collected. In Terengganu, we collaborated with a local 
NGO, Geng Plastik Ija and the state’s Department of 
Statistics Malaysia branch to collect 1,897 kilogrammes of 
waste, with 844 kilogrammes of recyclable waste 
materials.

(Excludes Corporate and Others)
In reviewing and improving our GHG emissions accounting methods, the total GHG emissions for operational control 
changed from previous disclosures due to the change of organisational boundary during re-baselining activities 
conducted in FY2022. Changes in scope since 2021 disclosures cover the inclusion of VESTIGO* and Iraq operations 
and removal of Myanmar because of divestment.
Our emissions in 2022 were higher compared to 2021 due to increased operational activities along the value chain 
following recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The short-term target of capping GHG emissions at 49.5 Million tCO2e by 2024, includes the oil and gas value chain 
where more than 90 per cent of GHG emissions are contributed by activities in Upstream, Gas and Downstream 
Malaysia operations excluding Corporate and Others** activities. Furthermore, GHG emissions accounting for Corporate 
and Others require further refinements due to different organisational boundary used previously. Hence, subsequent 
analysis depicted below exclude Corporate and Others.
GHG Emissions Breakdown by Scope, Gases and Sources for Operational Control
(Excludes Corporate and Others)
In FY2022, total GHG emissions from Scope 1 and Scope 2 for Malaysia and International assets under operational 
control boundary is 49.58 Million tCO2e.
In the oil and gas value chain, GHG emissions from Gas business contributed 46 per cent, followed by 28 per cent 
from Upstream and 26 per cent from Downstream. 96 per cent of emissions were from Scope 1 where the sources 
were mainly from stationary combustion, flaring and venting. Meanwhile Scope 2 only contributed to 4 per cent of 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
GHG emissions from Malaysia operations have been showing positive improvements, as it remained below the cap of 
49.5 Million tCO2e. This was contributed by ongoing investment in GHG emissions reduction efforts from FY2019 to 
FY2022 despite economic downturn. For international operations, total GHG emissions from Scope 1 and Scope 2 
increased in FY2022 due to the increase in production from Iraq and Canada operations.

GHG Emissions Reduction from Projects (Million tCO2e/year)
GHG emissions reduction are calculated as per ISO 14064-2: 2019 and do not reflect the year-on-year GHG emissions differences. According 
to ISO 14064-2, GHG projects are activities that alter the conditions of a GHG baseline and which cause GHG emissions reduction or GHG 
removal enhancements.
Cumulatively since 2013, we have reduced 18.1 Million tCO2e of GHG emissions from our operations. Over the years, 
GHG emissions reduction was achieved through flaring and venting reduction initiatives in Upstream as well as energy 
efficiency improvements in Gas and Downstream businesses. Moving forward, electrification and CCS efforts will 
contribute more to meet our short-term and mid-term targets.

GHG Emissions – Equity Share
GHG Emissions – Equity Share
Total GHG Emissions Breakdown by Business (Million tCO2e)
Equity share reflects economic interest, which is the extent of rights a company has to the risks and rewards flowing 
from an operation. Hence, PETRONAS has set mid-term and long-term targets by referring to FY2019 as the base year 
on equity share approach. The GHG emissions for FY2019 is adjusted to be 54.87 Million tCO2e taking into 
consideration divestments and changes of equity ownership in Upstream business, as well as new information obtained 
from equity partners in Gas and Downstream businesses. In 2022, Gas business contributed the highest GHG emissions 
(37.50 per cent), followed by Upstream business (36.87 per cent), Downstream business (21.03 per cent), and Corporate 
and Others (4.60 per cent).

PETRONAS has started to calculate and disclose Scope 3 GHG emissions for Category 11: Use of Sold Products. 
PETRONAS has plans to validate the Scope 3 methodology and conduct external verification in subsequent years. 
Under operational control and equity share approaches, Scope 3 GHG emissions show a 6.09 per cent and 3.99 per 
cent increase respectively compared to 2021. This is due to the increase in energy demand post-COVID 19 recovery.

Commitment to Governance

Board Governance and Structure
PETRONAS has resolutely demonstrated a progressive and resilient performance despite the challenging global 
business environment. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant economic contraction, putting corporate 
governance practices of organisations worldwide to the test. PETRONAS, has remained resilient in its commitment to 
apply the best corporate governance principles across the Group.
Corporate governance plays a crucial role in promoting sustainability by providing the necessary framework for 
accountability, transparency and structure within the Group. In building a sustainable business, the Board is fully aware 
of its responsibility towards its shareholders and stakeholders. The Board firmly upholds effective leadership and 
unwavering ethical standards by providing the framework which serves as a basis for sustainable decision-making.
PETRONAS is led by a Board whose Directors are collectively responsible for creating and delivering long-term 
sustainable value for the business. A key responsibility of the Board is to balance the interests of the Group and our 
stakeholders including employees and the wider communities we serve. Our governance structure ensures role clarity 
by clearly delineating roles and areas of accountability and recognises the independent roles and duties required to 
effectively govern the Company. The governance structure aims to promote strategic alignment across the Group whilst 
facilitating efficient decision-making at all levels.
Corporate Governance at PETRONAS
Board Leadership
The Board provides effective stewardship and is responsible 
for the Group’s strategic direction and control of the 
Company. The Board exercises this control by way of a 
governance framework, effective delegation, risk 
management and a system of assurances regarding 
financial reporting and internal controls. The Board is 
accountable to its shareholders and towards a wider range 
of stakeholders such as employees, suppliers, community 
and the authorities.
Each Director has the duty to act in good faith and in the 
best interest of the Company. In discharging its roles and 
duties effectively, the Board is guided by the Board 
Charter, a document which sets out the authority, 
responsibilities and operations of the Board. 
The differing roles of the Chairman and the President and 
GCEO are acknowledged and provided for in the Board 
Charter. The Chairman of the Board is not a member of 
any of the Board Committees.
The Board exercises collective oversight at all times. In 
delegating its authority to the Board Committees, the 
Board does not abdicate its responsibilities. The Board 
further ensures that such delegation does not hinder or 
reduce the Board’s ability to discharge its functions. In this 
regard, the Board clearly sets out the division of 
responsibilities in the respective Terms of Reference (TOR) 
of the Board Committees.
Together with Management, the Board upholds good 
corporate governance culture within the Company by 
ensuring ethical leadership, prudence and professional 
behaviour in the conduct of its business and in all aspects 
of its operations.
How the Board Functions
The Board meets regularly, and additional meetings are 
arranged as and when circumstances dictate. Each meeting 
is conducted in accordance with a formal and structured 
agenda and Board papers are circulated on time to ensure 
that Directors are well-informed and that debates and 
decisions are constructive and robust. 
Access to Board papers by the Board members is carried 
out online through a collaborative software, with the aim 
of enhancing the efficiency of the Board process. Going 
digital allows the Directors to access, read and review the 
Board papers, as well as enables the Board members to 
confer with each other and with the Company Secretaries, 
electronically. Board Papers and presentations by the 
Management to the Board are prepared and delivered in a 
manner that ensures clarity and provide sufficient 
understanding of the subject matter.
In 2022, the Board met on 23 occasions of which almost 
all meetings were conducted physically. Although the 
quorum for the Board meeting is two, majority of the 
Board meetings were attended by all Directors.
Each Director has full access to the services of the 
Company Secretaries, who play an advisory role to the 
Board by providing guidance on corporate governance, 
ethical business practices, compliance to the Company’s 
Constitution, policies and procedures and the relevant 
regulatory requirements, guidelines and legislation. 
The Board may from time to time and if deemed 
appropriate, consider and approve urgent matters via 
Directors’ circular resolution. All circular resolutions passed 
by the Board are tabled at the next Board meeting for 
notation. 
The Board practises active and open discussions at its 
meetings so as to ensure that opportunities are given to 
all Directors to participate and contribute to the decision-
making process. Robust discussions and vigorous 
deliberations at the Board meetings ensure that the 
process of effective and healthy dialogue is achieved.
The respective Chairmen of the Audit Committee, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee and Risk 
Committee provide regular updates to the Board 
subsequent to the proceedings of their respective 
Committee meetings.
All proceedings of Board meetings are duly minuted, 
confirmed and signed. Minutes of each Board meeting 
accurately reflect the deliberations and decisions of the 
Board, including any dissenting views and if any Director 
had abstained from voting or deliberating on a particular 
matter. Minutes of the Board meetings are properly kept 
by the Company Secretary.
Matters Reserved for the Board
The Board has an approved and documented schedule 
of matters reserved for its decision as follows:
1. 
Strategy and Management – Strategy, policies, 
annual budgets and major investment decisions 
which include capital projects, mergers and 
acquisitions and funding requirements.
2. 
Financial, Governance and Risk – Financial 
reporting and control, and risk management.
3. 
Corporate Matters – Reputation and stakeholder 
management, Health, Safety, Security and 
Environment (HSSE), Board and Board Committees’ 
memberships, Directors’ remuneration and 
succession planning.

mitigations to manage or reduce the likelihood and impact of these 
critical risks. Key risk indicators which provide early warnings of risk 
manifestation were also reported to the Board.
To ensure risks undertaken in pursuit of business objectives are within 
Board acceptable level, the Board approved the Company’s risk 
appetite which sets its key operational boundaries. Any breach of risk 
appetite may jeopardise the Company’s business sustainability, hence, 
will be escalated to the Board for deliberation.

Board Strategic Conversation Series
In addition to the above meetings, the PETRONAS Board Strategic Conversation (BSC) Series are held periodically as 
part of the initiative to achieve a high performing Board. The BSC Series, which include Sustainability Series are 
conducted in-house or by external subject matter experts. 
It aims to provide updates and discussions on sustainability and market outlook. It also includes the deliberations on the 
Group’s strategic and growth plans for the purposes of enriching the Directors’ knowledge and for the Directors to 
keep abreast with the latest trends and development.
Board Balance and Effectiveness
Fit and Proper Policy
In September 2022, the Board had approved the 
establishment of the Directors’ Fit and Proper Policy (the 
Policy) as an enhancement of the existing PETRONAS 
Board Selection Criteria. The Policy aims to ensure that 
any person to be appointed or elected/re-elected as a 
Director of the PETRONAS Group shall possess the 
character, integrity, experience, competence, commitment 
to contribute in discharging his or her responsibilities 
required of the appointment in the most effective manner. 
Diversity
The Board recognises the importance of diversity and the 
value it brings to the PETRONAS Group. Diversity 
promotes the inclusion of different perspectives, raising 
the standards of good practice in Board leadership and 
enhancement of valuable insights in business judgment. 
Diversity is also important to ensure the Company 
remains relevant, resilient and sustainable in the rapidly 
transforming and evolving business environment.
Whilst it is important to promote diversity, the normal 
selection criteria of a Director based on an effective blend 
of competencies, skills, experience and knowledge in 
areas identified by the Board remains a priority so as not 
to compromise the effectiveness in carrying out the 
Board’s functions and duties. The Board is committed to 
ensure that its composition not only reflects diversity but 
will also have the right mix of skills and balance to 
contribute to the achievement of the Company’s goals 
and objectives.
Board Balance and Composition
As at the date of this report, the Board of Directors of 
PETRONAS comprises nine members; the Non-Executive 
Chairman, two Executive Directors and six Non-Executive 
Directors (NEDs), out of which four are Independent  
Non-Executive Directors (INEDs). The biographical details 
of the Directors are set out on page 259.
The size and composition of the Board is fundamental to 
its success in providing strong and effective leadership. 
The presence of Non-Executive Directors ensures that no 
individual or small group of Directors are able to dominate 
the decision-making process and that the interests of 
shareholders and stakeholders are protected. 
During the year under review, the Board saw some 
changes and new appointments to its composition.
In view of the retirement of Puan Zakiah Jaafar effective 
22 April 2022, Datuk Seri Asri Hamidin @ Hamidon and his 
alternate, Datuk Johan Mahmood Merican, were appointed 
to the Board of PETRONAS on 28 April 2022. Datuk Seri 
Asri Hamidin @ Hamidon and Datuk Johan Mahmood 
Merican had, however, resigned on 5 January 2023.
The Board wishes to record its appreciation and gratitude 
to Puan Zakiah Jaafar, Datuk Seri Asri Hamidin @ 
Hamidon and Datuk Johan Mahmood Merican for their 
contribution and commitment during their tenure on the 
Board.
The Board also welcomed Datuk KY Mustafa as a NINED 
on the PETRONAS Board effective 19 January 2022.
The current composition of the Board has a blend of 
skills, experience and knowledge which enables them to 
provide effective oversight, strategic guidance and 
constructive challenge, review and deliberation on the 
Management’s proposals. The NRC is responsible for 
reviewing the composition of the Board and assessing 
whether the balance of skills, experience, knowledge and 
independence is appropriate to enable the Board to 
perform effectively as a high performing Board.

Corporate Governance at PETRONAS


Board Independence
The Board assesses the independence of its NEDs annually. The independence assessment takes into account whether 
the NEDs have demonstrated an independent state of mind and objective judgment in their deliberations and decision-
making process. The assessment on the independence of the NEDs may be undertaken in the following circumstances:
1  Prior to the Appointment of 
Non-Executive Directors
2 Annual Review
3 Notice of Change of Circumstances
Prior to the appointment of NEDs, the 
independence of each individual candidate 
will be reviewed and determined by the 
Board based on the recommendations 
from the NRC upon reviewing his/her 
criteria per the PETRONAS Independent 
Directors Guidelines.
The Board determines the independence 
of each NED annually, based on the 
recommendations from the NRC per the 
PETRONAS Independent Directors 
Guidelines.
Each NED has an affirmative obligation to 
notify the NRC of any change in 
circumstances that may affect his/her 
independence status. Once notified, the 
NRC shall re-evaluate the independence 
status and make the necessary 
recommendations to the Board.
The INEDs have been appointed for their specific experience and expertise and are independent of management and 
free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent 
judgement. NEDs may serve on the boards of other companies provided this does not involve a conflict of interest and 
that the appointment does not restrict their ability to discharge their duties to PETRONAS in any way.
In line with the exemplary practices of corporate governance, the Board has adopted a tenure policy whereby an 
INED’s total tenure on the Board is capped at nine years. As at the date of this Statement, none of the INEDs has 
served the Board for more than nine years.
Conflict of Interest
In ensuring transparency and integrity of the decision-making process as well as to prevent any conflict of interest, a 
declaration of interest by Directors is a fixed agenda item at the start of every Board meeting. A Director who has direct 
or indirect interest in a transaction shall recuse himself/herself when required and abstain from deliberations and voting to 
allow unbiased and free discussions and decision-making. Disclosure of the nature and extent of the Directors’ interest 
and abstention from decision making proceedings are recorded in the minutes of the Board meetings. The Principles of 
Directorship for the PETRONAS Group was established to govern the way Directors conduct themselves in a conflict-of-
interest situation, which corresponds with the Companies Act 2016 and the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics (CoBE) 
of the Company. 
The Directors are also required to declare their interests annually, in line with the requirements on the disclosure of 
Director’s interests in the Company’s Audited Financial Statements.
Board Remuneration Policy
Given the highly competitive market, PETRONAS designed a robust fee structure to attract, retain and appropriately 
compensate the diverse and internationally experienced NEDs. The fee framework is illustrated below:

Board Onboarding and Professional Development Programme
The Board recognises the importance of ensuring that new Directors have a complete introduction to the business so 
that they are able to make a full and meaningful contribution to the Board. To that end, the Board has adopted a 
comprehensive and extensive onboarding programme for new Directors, including meetings with key senior leadership 
as teams, bespoke training on relevant regulatory and legal obligations and onboard procedures and processes. 
Directors have full access to roundtable discussions, seminars and other events, covering topics relevant to the Group 
and their roles. The Company provides Directors with the necessary resources to update their knowledge and 
capabilities throughout the year.
A suite of development programmes, known as the PETRONAS Board Excellence, tailor-made to the requirements of 
Directors across the Group, has been in place since 2016 to chart the Directors’ development plans in a structured 
manner.

*  The Foundational programmes only apply to the directors who are employees of the PETRONAS Group, thus, the PETRONAS Directors, 
upon their onboarding, will attend the Advanced programmes of the PBE.
The PETRONAS PBE programme is developed upon the 
occurrence of new concern for the Directors’ awareness 
and knowledge that may involve the Directors’ roles and 
responsibilities. Moving forward, sustainability has been 
identified for inclusion in the PBE programme, which will 
be carried out in 2023. In this instance the programme is 
intended to create awareness among the directors on the 
importance of sustainability and the accountabilities of 
Directors as part of the Environmental, Social and 
Governance requirements.
Qualified and Competent Company Secretaries
The Company Secretaries of PETRONAS are qualified to act 
as company secretary by virtue of Section 235 of the CA 
2016. Both of the Company Secretaries are legally qualified. 
They act as advisors to the Board, particularly with regard 
to the PETRONAS’ Constitution, policies and procedures 
and its compliance with regulatory requirements, codes, 
guidelines and legislations.
The Company Secretaries act as an important link 
between the Board and the Management. Through 
effective communication, they provide the Management 
with the understanding on the expectations of, and value 
brought by the Board.
 
The Company Secretaries ensure that discussions and 
deliberations at the Board and Board Committee meetings 
are well documented, and subsequently communicated to 
the Management for appropriate actions. The Company 
Secretaries update the Board on the follow-up of its 
decisions and recommendations. The Board is satisfied 
with the performance and support rendered by the 
Company Secretaries to the Board in discharging their 
functions in the financial year under review.
The Company Secretaries also constantly keep themselves 
abreast of the evolving regulatory changes and developments 
in corporate governance through continuous training. 
Board Evaluation
The Board, through the NRC, endeavours to conduct 
annual performance evaluation of the Board and its 
Committees, facilitated by the Company Secretary. 
Evaluation results are reported to the NRC. Individual 
Director’s evaluation results are made available to the 
NRC Chairman and reported directly to the Chairman of 
the Board. The Chairman of the Board will then conduct 
feedback sessions through peer-to-peer meetings.

Corporate Governance at PETRONAS


During the year under review, the NRC had engaged an 
independent third-party consultant to conduct the Board 
Effectiveness Evaluation (BEE). The process of the BEE 
involved a set of questionnaires consisting of evaluations 
by the Board, Board Committee and Self-Assessment 
which were developed to maximise the effectiveness and 
performance of the Board in the best interests of 
PETRONAS. The indicators for the performance of the 
Board include, among others, the Board composition, 
planning process, conduct, communication with the 
Management and stakeholders, as well as strategy and 
planning for the Company. The consultant thereafter 
performed an independent assessment on the findings 
and areas of improvement and presented to the NRC for 
its consideration.
The NRC reviewed the outcome of the 2022 BEE 
whereby the findings of the BEE indicated that the Board 
is committed to the highest standards of good 
governance and affirmed the effectiveness of the Board. 
Directors’ Indemnity 
PETRONAS continues to provide and maintain 
indemnification for its Directors throughout the financial 
year as allowed under the CA 2016 to the extent it is 
insurable under the Directors’ and Officers’ Liability 
Insurance (D&O) procured by the Company. Directors and 
Officers are indemnified against any liability incurred by 
them in discharging their duties while holding office as 
Directors and Officers of the Company. All Directors may 
opt to obtain D&O insurance to provide insurance 
protection (to the extent it is insurable) against 
unindemnified liabilities by the Company or uninsured 
circumstances. The premium to be paid by all Directors is 
determined by the insurance company.
Succession Planning 
The Board Succession Planning Framework had been 
adopted by the Board to assist the Company in ensuring 
a structured and timely identification and selection of new 
Non-Executive Directors in the event of an opening on 
the Board, whether such opening exists by reason of an 
anticipated retirement, the expansion of the size of the 
Board, or otherwise. Such structured succession plan 
addresses the composition and effectiveness of the Board. 
The Board, through the NRC, has the responsibility in 
ensuring appropriate succession planning of Directors and 
reviewing the Board’s required mix of skills and 
experience, as well as reviewing the tenure of INEDs on 
the Board.
In addition to succession planning for the Directors, the 
NRC also reviewed the succession plan of key management 
positions of the Company. The NRC continued to focus 
on conducting all relevant reviews and assessments of key 
management positions. 
Board Commitment to Sustainability
The Board acknowledges that the well-being of the 
employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders as 
well as the environment and the society at large is central 
to sustaining our long-term performance and continued 
relevance. Careful consideration of the needs of a broader 
universe of stakeholders ultimately drives value for the 
shareholders.
The heightened materiality of sustainability to the business 
requires the Board to factor in these sustainability 
components, risks and opportunities into its deliberations 
at all times. The Board, being the highest authority in 
sustainability governance, has taken the initiative in the 
establishment of the Company’s approach to sustainability 
and road map. During the year under review, the Board’s 
engagement and oversight of sustainability related matters 
were broadened.
Board’s Oversight of Climate-Related Risks and 
Opportunities
The Board recognises that climate is a critical business 
issue, contributing to a set of risks and opportunities. The 
Board is taking more deliberate actions in elevating 
sustainability, especially climate-related discussions to 
shape the long-term strategic direction of the company. 
Key oversight by the Board on climate-related risks and 
opportunities in 2022 are as follows:
• Endorsement by the RC on the PETRONAS Corporate 
Risk Profile considering climate-related risk and its 
mitigation on quarterly basis for Board’s approval.
• Approval of Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 
Pathway and alignment to the annual business plan and 
budget cycle.
• Approval of Nature and Biodiversity Position in support 
of the Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 Pathway.
• Approval of Nature-based Climate Solutions strategy.
• Approval of climate-related matrix as part of the 
long-term incentive plan for senior leadership. In 2022, 
20 per cent of the long-term incentive plan consists of 
ESG elements and this includes measurement of net 
carbon intensity as well as diversity and inclusion.
• Approved the formation of Gentari Sdn Bhd, an 
independent entity focused on providing clean energy 
solutions.
• Quarterly conversation series with global sustainability 
experts, with a dedicated session on climate change 
that includes Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosure (TCFD), human rights and just transition.

The RC supports the Board in reviewing principal risks 
and oversees the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk 
assessment and risk management system for the 
PETRONAS Group. The Committee also deliberates on risk 
mitigation strategies and measures, reviews investment 
proposals that are significant from the risk perspective as 
well as monitors the activities on integrity-related 
initiatives for the PETRONAS Group. 
Compliance
Tone from the Top
The compliance culture in PETRONAS is championed by the “tone from the top”, driven by the principles of PETRONAS 
Cultural Beliefs and Shared Values. The continuous messaging from the PETRONAS Board of Directors and PETRONAS 
Executive Leadership Team sets the values for the expected conduct and ethics. It shapes the behaviour and attitude of 
PETRONAS employees at all levels of businesses and activities across the PETRONAS Group.
Operationalising Compliance from the Ground
As PETRONAS operates in multiple jurisdictions worldwide, the Compliance Management Operations (CMO) team is 
structured to ensure compliance with domestic and global requirements by establishing offices at the PETRONAS 
headquarters in Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC), as well as regional offices in Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East 
and the Americas. The regional compliance management offices support PETRONAS’ compliance position by 
implementing adequate and effective controls, conducting compliance programmes and activities, and developing 
localised content in line with local laws and requirements. They achieve this through a risk-based approach and 
constant engagement with the headquarters while also ensuring alignment with PETRONAS’ compliance practices.
In ensuring compliance management operations are comprehensive and up-to-date, the Subject Matter Expert (SME) 
team would keep abreast with updated regulations, laws and enforcements guidance from all over the globe, as well as 
develop compliance policies, processes and procedures for PETRONAS businesses and activities. Additionally, the SME 
team would provide specialist legal advice, steer the strategic direction of PETRONAS business, and set up PETRONAS 
group positions.
The RC discharges its responsibilities through its 
scheduled meetings during the year in accordance with 
its fixed agenda which covers the matters under the 
purview of the RC. The RC met eight times in 2022.
[For more information about the RC’s attendance, please refer to

Similarly, for effective and efficient management of the compliance programmes and activities, the Compliance Strategy 
and Planning (CSP) team would develop and plan the PETRONAS’ corporate compliance strategy and programmes, as well 
as develop and maintain the overall compliance systems and tools. These will ensure seamless planning, consistent 
management and monitoring of corporate compliance status, programmes and activities across PETRONAS.
Together, the three teams form the Legal Compliance department of Group Legal, which delivers comprehensive and 
integrated legal compliance programmes and activities for PETRONAS, with the ultimate aim of protecting and 
safeguarding PETRONAS Group of Companies against any breaches of laws.
Digitalising Compliance
A digital solution called myCompliance, has been developed and deployed across PETRONAS Group of Companies for 
efficient and effective monitoring of legal and regulatory compliance. This digital compliance platform simplifies 
compliance management operations and has been linked with other relevant systems including myLearningX (on 
eLearning Modules), myASSURANCE (on Assurance programme) and myGOVERNANCE (on policies repository) to ensure 
the data is reliable, up-to-date and accurate.
The following are the five modules that have been deployed as part of myCompliance digital solutions:
a) Compliance Tracker – Tracking and analysis of compliance assurance programme.
b) Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) – Digitalisation of TPRM programme.
c) Training Tracker – Tracking the completion of mandatory compliance trainings.
d) Policy Management – Centralised policy development process and repository. 
e) Regulation Tracker – Centralised repository of laws.
The myCompliance digital solution reduces PETRONAS’ risk to potential threats such as incurring financial and non-
financial penalties, loss of business opportunities, and severe reputational impact on the enterprise. This is achieved 
through improved oversight and ease of operations, both directly and indirectly.
Focus Areas
PETRONAS focuses on Critical Legal Areas (CLAs) and Operational Legal Areas (OLAs) through a robust compliance 
programme as encapsulated in its Legal Compliance Framework (LCF), the overarching framework on ensuring compliance 
with laws and regulations that PETRONAS has identified. 
The CLAs are laws with extra-territorial effect. Any breach of the law could result in significant civil and criminal 
penalties, legal suits and severe reputational impact, which may pose enterprise risks to PETRONAS. The OLAs are 
operational laws that relate to business activities and operations, where any breach poses threats to the continuous 
operations of the business, including the loss of the license to operate.

The compliance programme and controls for CLAs have stabilised and matured since its establishment in 2018. Throughout 
this long journey, the focus is now on gap improvement and full compliance by PETRONAS Group of Companies with 
the requirements of laws under the CLAs. On the other hand, the compliance programme and controls for the OLAs 
are still in the development stage, as it was only established recently in May 2022.
The controls embedded by LCF are grouped into 5 Key Compliance Areas (5 KCAs) – an essential tool in strengthening 
and monitoring the compliance culture in PETRONAS. The status of controls under each of the 5 KCAs are reported on 
a quarterly basis to the top management of Group Legal and Group Risk Management via the Corporate Risk Profile/
Risk Appetite report, as well as escalated (where necessary) to PETRONAS Risk Committee (RC) and PETRONAS Board 
of Directors (Board). This ensures the top management is made aware of the progress of the implementation of Legal 
Compliance Control (LCC) across the PETRONAS Group of Companies.

PETRONAS establishes various governance documents, including policies, standards, guidelines, frameworks and 
manuals, as the foundation for internal controls to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. In FY2022, new 
governance documents were developed, and existing governance documents were enhanced for relevancy to current 
requirements. These governance documents are required to be adopted and implemented by PETRONAS Group of 
Companies.

PETRONAS continues to deliver enterprise-wide training and awareness programmes via digital platforms (i.e. eLearning 
Modules) and customised engagements through its compliance management officers to instil awareness among 
PETRONAS staff and directors towards compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. 
In 2022, more than 36,000 employees across PETRONAS Group of Companies have completed the mandatory 
compliance eLearning Modules. On top of the eLearning Modules, 256 additional focused training and engagement 
sessions were conducted in FY2022 for PETRONAS Group of Companies, with more than 17,000 participants benefitting 
from these customised sessions.

Given the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, online courses, webinars and virtual training dominated the first half of 
FY2022. Physical engagements started to increase in the second half of FY2022 as Malaysia entered the endemic stage 
in quarter two of FY2022. In total, 89 per cent of training and engagement sessions were conducted virtually, and 11 
per cent were completed physically (six per cent) or in hybrid mode (five per cent).
As PETRONAS Group of Companies deals with various third parties, including partners, contractors, vendors, suppliers, 
distributors and agents, the Company manages its third-party risks through its Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) 
framework. TPRM is a robust due diligence process to safeguard PETRONAS from any exposure to the breaches of the 
CLAs especially from any corporate liability due to any misconduct from third parties.
The TPRM enables PETRONAS to detect possible threats before any formal engagement or during the business 
relationship with third parties. It would also allow for mitigation or contractual safeguard against legal, financial or 
reputational damage risks. The TPRM applies to all businesses and needs to be embedded by PETRONAS Group of 
Companies.
TPRM documents and tools have been developed to guide the implementation of the TPRM process and for PETRONAS 
Group of Companies to embed and apply across all businesses and needs.

PETRONAS reviews its business practices and activities regularly and ensures these practices are updated and aligned 
with legal and regulatory compliance. It has also put pre-emptive measures that PETRONAS Entities must embed and 
implement to ensure that PETRONAS Group of Companies adopt the best business practices and activities.
Below are some examples of the pre-emptive measures:
1. Export Control Licensing;
2. Sanctions Licensing;
3. General Retention of Consent;
4. Retention of Personal Data;
5. Accuracy of Personal Data;
6. Employees’ Conflict of Interest Declaration;
7. Gift Declaration Form; and
8. Display of Privacy Notice.
PETRONAS verifies the adequacy and effectiveness of controls through rigorous monitoring and assurance activities. The 
control, oversight and monitoring of PETRONAS Group of Companies’ compliance towards CLAs are achieved through 
a structured annual compliance self-assessment under PETRONAS Integrated Assurance Programme. This has also been 
introduced to cover OLAs.
Group Legal (as one of PETRONAS’ Second Line Assurance Providers), along with Group Internal Audit (as one of 
PETRONAS’ Third Line Assurance Providers), effectively identify, evaluate and recommend an intervention to address 
potential non-compliances and unsound practices using PETRONAS’ Three Lines of Defence model. The results of the 
review or audit may lead to identification of new controls to be developed or existing controls to be enhanced to 
continuously improve the legal compliance posture of PETRONAS Group.
In 2022, PETRONAS completed three assurance programmes to ensure compliance with the requirements stipulated 
under Critical and Operational Laws.
1. First Line Assurance for Critical Legal Areas;
2. Second Line Assurance for Critical Legal Areas; and
3. First Line Assurance for Operational Legal Areas.
On an annual basis, the compliance status of PETRONAS Entities towards the establishment of Legal Compliance 
Controls will be reported to the management of the Entities, as well as the management of Group Legal. This ensures 
the top management is aware of any gaps in its control implementation and will strive to close the gap in the most 
practical and feasible way possible.
PETRONAS adopts zero tolerance for any form of bribery or corruption. The PETRONAS CoBE, 
PETRONAS Anti Bribery and Corruption Manual, and PETRONAS Whistleblowing Policy are in 
place to guide PETRONAS employees and third parties when dealing with potential or actual 
bribery and corruption situations or improper conduct in their day-to-day business activities.
PETRONAS has established an Integrity Governance Unit (IGU) or Group Integrity as per Arahan Perdana Menteri (PM) 
2018 (Prime Minister’s Directive of 2018) to perform the four (4) core functions, which are Complaint Management, 
Detection Verification, Integrity Strengthening and Governance. In support of Group Integrity, Integrity Focal Person 
(IFP)’s have been established to implement and report on Integrity Strengthening and Governance related matters.
In August 2022, PETRONAS’ Executive Leadership Team signed the “Ikrar Bebas Rasuah,” or Corruption-Free-Pledge to 
demonstrate Top-level commitment to the ‘TRUST’ principle of adequate procedure as one of the defences against 
Corporate Liability. The ‘TRUST’ principles are Top Level Commitment (T), Risk Assessment (R), Undertake control 
measures (U), Systematic review, monitoring and enforcement (S), Training and communication (T).
The PETRONAS Organisational Anti-Corruption Plan (OACP) 2022-2023 has been published with the aspiration of “Zero 
tolerance for corruption in the pursuit of a corruption-free organisation”. The OACP strategies focus on:
• Strengthening corporate governance on people and processes
• Increased confidence on the internal controls and improved business processes efficiency
• Holistic approach and pervasive communication on ethics and integrity
PETRONAS Holding Company Unit has been ISO 37001:2016 Anti Bribery Management System (ABMS) certified since 
November 2017. This demonstrates our commitment to managing any corruption-related (integrity-related) activities 
while adhering to all applicable laws and regulations.
Pursuant to the Corruption Risk Assessment, sensitive positions have been identified as one of the mitigations to 
manage the corruption risk. 
A significant increase in whistleblowing complaints indicates increased awareness of the channel and trust for people to 
report their concerns, serving as a preventive measure in managing integrity.
In collaboration with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Academy (MACA), PETRONAS continues to upskill our staff on 
integrity and governance through the Certified Integrity Officer (CeIO) programme.
Various integrity strengthening programmes are implemented on a regular basis across the group to raise awareness of 
integrity-related topics such as whistleblowing and corporate liability.

Segment Earnings
Businesses across the value chain took bold choices and displayed operational resilience to capture market uptrend, 
which resulted in a solid financial performance for the year 2022.
• The Group operated three core businesses in FY2022, namely Upstream, Gas and Downstream.
• Corporate and Others which complements our core businesses, comprising primarily the maritime and logistics 
segment; property segment and central treasury; project delivery and technology division as well as the renewables, 
hydrogen and green mobility businesses. 
Upstream
• During the year, Upstream business recorded a PAT of RM51.3 
billion as compared to RM34.5 billion in FY2021 primarily driven by 
higher revenue partially offset by higher taxation as well as product 
costs in line with higher prices.
• The increase in Upstream revenue was mainly attributable to 
higher average realised prices for crude oil and condensates and 
natural gas as well as higher natural gas sales volume.
• Total daily production average of 2,434 thousand barrels of oil 
equivalent (boe) per day in FY2022, increase from 2,275 thousand 
boe per day in FY2021 was mainly driven by overall improved 
demand for gas in Peninsular Malaysia coupled with realised 
opportunities and better performance from international operations.
[Further details on Upstream’s operational performance can be found on page 106]
Gas
• Gas business recorded a PAT of RM43.2 billion as compared to 
PAT of RM15.1 billion in FY2021 mainly contributed by higher 
revenue partially offset by higher product costs and taxation. 
• The revenue in FY2022 recorded an increase of 61 per cent 
against the previous year, contributed by higher demand from the 
power sector. PETRONAS has concluded 136 MMscfd of natural 
gas supply deals with new and existing customers from the 
non-power sector.

tax in line with higher prices. Despite the increase in 
the Group’s total costs, PETRONAS recorded a lower 
Group Cost to Revenue ratio of 75 per cent in FY2022 
compared to 81 per cent in the previous year, 
demonstrating our effective cost management efforts.

Group Financial Results and Position


Downstream
• Downstream business also recorded a PAT of RM7.5 billion against 
PAT of RM3.0 billion in FY2021 following the improved refining 
and petrochemical margins.
• During the year, Downstream business recorded stable operations 
with OEE sustained at 85.9 per cent, on the back of strong asset 
reliability.
• Petroleum products sales volume was 260.7 million barrels, higher 
by 1.7 million barrels following increased trading activities. Crude 
oil sales volume was 114.3 million barrels, higher by 4.6 million 
barrels mainly due to higher marketing volume. Petrochemical 
products sales volume was 8.3 million tonnes, higher by 0.1 million 
tonnes.
[More information on Downstream’s operational performance is available on  
page 126]
Corporate and Others
• Corporate and Other businesses recorded a PAT of RM0.2 billion, 
as compared to FY2021’s Loss After Tax (LAT) of RM1.5 billion. 
• Higher PAT recorded mainly due to higher revenue and favourable 
impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by higher operating 
expenditure.
• MISC Berhad (MISC) and KLCC Property Holdings Berhad (KLCCP) 
were the two major contributors to this segment. MISC recorded a 
PAT of RM1.8 billion during the year, mainly from increased freight 
rates in the Petroleum and Product Shipping segment as well as 
the Marine and Heavy Engineering segment turned profitable 
during the year in tandem with higher revenue coupled with 
recovery of COVID-19 claims and reversal of cost provisions for 
both on-going and post sail-away projects. KLCCP’s PAT increased 
to RM0.9 billion as compared to RM0.5 billion in the same period 
last year mainly due to the higher revenue of 24.6 per cent to 
RM1.5 billion.

Segment Capital Investments
• Amidst the continued volatility of the energy market and 
the call for energy transition, we remain steadfast in 
strengthening our portfolio through strict capital discipline, 
ensuring sufficient allocation for our cash generators, 
investments in growth, and transformation towards a 
low-carbon future. Overall CAPEX spent during the year 
was RM50.1 billion, higher compared with RM30.4 billion 
in FY2021.
• We continue to strengthen our core business and pursue 
CAPEX in the energy transition. RM12.5 billion or 25 per 
cent of total CAPEX was spent on New business. This 
includes the successful acquisition of Perstorp Holding AB, 
a leading sustainability-driven global specialty chemicals 
company based in Sweden. Decarbonisation projects such 
as Kasawari Carbon Capture and Sequestration were 
undertaken during the year.
• Moving forward, more allocation of CAPEX is projected in 
scaling up investment in the core business, lowering 
emissions as well as investing in clean energy to future-
proof the Group’s portfolio.
Upstream
• CAPEX for Upstream business accounted for 47 per cent 
of the the Group’s total CAPEX with a total spending of 
RM23.7 billion, an increase of RM9.0 billion as compared 
to FY2021. Upstream’s CAPEX for FY2022 was 
predominantly spent on exploration, development and 
production activities aimed at sustaining and growing 
production in Malaysia and international operations. 
• About RM10.5 billion or 44 per cent of Upstream total 
CAPEX was spent domestically to intensify efforts to 
enhance the recovery rate of existing fields as well as the 
development of new fields. Among the key projects in 
Malaysia are Kasawari Gas Field Development, Integrated 
Bekok Oil, and Bayan Gas Phase 2.
• Meanwhile, a total of RM13.2 billion was allocated towards 
international portfolio investments, key countries include 
Brazil, Canada, Iraq and Argentina. The highlights of the 
investments include the acquisition of 21 per cent 
participating interests in the Sepia field in Brazil, one of 
the world’s most prolific basins.
Gas 
• Gas business accounted for 11 per cent of the Group’s 
total CAPEX and incurred a total spending of RM5.6 billion 
in FY2022.
• CAPEX for FY2022 were predominantly spent on 
international ventures particularly for LNG projects in 
Canada. 
• Domestic spending during the year remains comparable to 
FY2021. Moving forward, the approved Final Investment 
Decision (FID) for the Sabah nearshore LNG facility will 
increase future domestic CAPEX, while monetising gas 
resources in an optimised and and more environmentally 
conscious manner.
Downstream
• Downstream business’ CAPEX of RM16.3 billion during the 
year, accounted for 33 per cent of the Group’s overall 
CAPEX allocation.
• The spending made during the year was mainly related to 
the acquisition of Perstorp as well as other operational 
and growth projects. 
Corporate and Others
• CAPEX spent by businesses under Corporate and Others 
during the year of RM4.5 billion, was lower by RM0.3 billion 
as compared to FY2021 with MISC accounting for 78 per 
cent of the total spending.
• During the year, MISC’s significant investments were mainly 
from Dynamic Positioning Shuttle Tankers (DPST) and Very 
Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) amounting to RM1.2 billion.
CAPEX by Strategy
(RM billion)
As the momentum for the energy transition accelerates, the Three-Pronged Growth Strategy (3PGS) was further 
crystallised into the PETRONAS Energy Transition Strategy. PETRONAS remains steadfast in the journey towards Energy 
Transition, achieving our NZCE 2050 aspiration and step-out opportunities beyond the Group’s current core business. 
25 per cent of total CAPEX in FY2022 was spent on New Business.
Capital Investments by Business and Geographical Segment
Domestic CAPEX increased by 24 per cent compared to FY2021, contributing to the growth of the Malaysian oil and 
gas industry. 
Excluding international acquisitions made during the year, the CAPEX spent is divided almost equally between Malaysia 
and international projects.
Included in the Corporate and Others business segment is CAPEX incurred for Gentari.
