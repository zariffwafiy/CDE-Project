Dear Stakeholder,
We are pleased to present the PETRONAS Integrated Report 
2022. In this report, we cover the challenges we faced, our 
strategic progress, financial and operational performance

provide a comprehensive and balanced view of our value 
creation process as we strive to fulfil our role as a 
progressive energy and solutions partner, committed to 
building stakeholder trust through transparency.
Scope and Boundaries
This PETRONAS Integrated Report covers the full calendar year from 
1  January to 31 December 2022, unless stated otherwise. The report 
includes all our operations and activities across PETRONAS and its 
subsidiaries (PETRONAS Group), joint operations and associates.
Following our integrated approach to value creation, this report extends 
beyond financial reporting. It also covers:
• Non-financial information, including data from our owned and operated 
businesses in line with industry best practices. 
• Details in areas we do not have operational control over are included in 
disclosures of the management approach. 
• Our financial reporting includes the above mentioned data, following 
the accepted and relevant financial reporting standards.
• Our greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) data is reported for operated 
assets and those in which we have an equity share.
Reporting Frameworks
We are guided by the following national and international guidance, 
frameworks and standards to ensure that our report is accurate, reliable 
and comprehensive:
• The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) <IR> Framework
• International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
• Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards (MFRS)
• Ipieca/API/IOGP Sustainability reporting guidance for the oil and 
gas industry
• Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards
• World Economic Forum’s Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics
• Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
Sustainability Reporting
We aim to integrate Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) principles throughout our business 
strategies and decisions. We view ESG as an integral 
part of delivering long-term stakeholder value. 
Therefore, this report accounts for our sustainability 
aspiration and performance. Additionally, where relevant, 
the information disclosed makes reference to the 
United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs).
Connectivity of Information
To provide an overview of how we create value for 
long-term sustainability, we conducted a high-level 
integrated capitals assessment of this integrated report 
to determine the linkages, impact and synergies 
between our financial and non-financial capitals, 
material topics, stakeholder expectations, strategic 
objectives, risks and opportunities.

words such as “believe”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “seek”, 
“will”, “plan”, “could”, “may”, “endeavour” and similar 
expressions used to represent our judgements and 
future expectations. These statements involve risk and 
uncertainty because they relate to future events and 
circumstances and should be considered in light of the

Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS) is a leading global energy company committed to powering society’s progress 
in a responsible and sustainable manner. With close to 50,000 employees and a global reach spanning over 100 
countries, we are ranked among the world’s largest corporations by revenue in the Fortune Media IP Ltd’s 2022 Fortune 
Global 500® list. 
As Malaysia’s national oil and gas company, we safeguard and manage the nation’s hydrocarbon resources to ensure 
national energy security and maximise value. We explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons as well as cleaner energy 
solutions. We have three core businesses, namely Upstream, Gas and Downstream, supported by Project Delivery and 
Technology division, which acts as an enabler. We recently launched Gentari, our new entity providing customers with 
cleaner energy and lower carbon solutions in three core offerings – renewables, hydrogen and green mobility alongside 
our core portfolio.
We remain committed to produce oil and gas in a differentiated manner, with focus on reducing carbon emissions and 
at competitive cost. Our hydrocarbon portfolio today is two-thirds gas, which puts us in an advantageous position as 
gas and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) will continue to play a vital role even as the energy system evolves. As one of the 
leading LNG players in the world, PETRONAS will continue to serve the global LNG demand.
As a responsible and conscientious global energy player, sustainability is at the heart of our business and how we 
operate. Our commitment to responsible business growth and positive contributions to society and the environment 
remains unwavering. Fuelled by our passion to be a partner for our customers in the journey towards a lower carbon 
energy future, every step we take brings us closer towards achieving our aspiration of Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 
2050 (NZCE 2050).
Our long-standing track record as a global energy and solutions partner 
with extensive reach
and underpinned by responsible governance 
is driven by a dedicated team of people 
that supports our expanding business and portfolio.

Competitive Advantage
Having transformed PETRONAS from a domestic-based national oil and gas 
company into a fully integrated global energy player, we have gained 
valuable experience that enable us to navigate the energy transition and 
further contribute to societal progress. 
PETRONAS, as a leading global energy company aims to play a key role in 
the energy transition, focusing on energy security and at the same time 
delivering energy solutions responsibly. We became Southeast Asia’s first oil 
and gas company to declare our aspiration to achieve NZCE 2050. We see 
our role as a catalyst to speed up the transition to net zero specifically in 
Malaysia and Southeast Asia, drawing on our experience and reach as a 
global energy company. Strengthening our core business will sustain the 
vibrancy of the local Oil and Gas Services and Equipment (OGSE) 
ecosystem.
We strive for the utmost integrity in all aspects of our business and 
operations, implementing robust policies, systems and protocols to uphold 
ethical business practices and good governance. We ensure our employees 
and contractors work together in creating a safe working environment for 
all.
Our people are our greatest asset and growth partners. They fuel our 
passion for innovation to advance towards sustainable energy solutions. 
Across the globe, our employees lead the way in executing our strategic 
goals, armed with the knowledge and capabilities to thrive in a lower 
carbon future. 
With a proven track record in oil and gas exploration, development and 
production both in Malaysia and internationally and supported by our strong 
financial performance, we are broadening our portfolio to encompass clean 
energy solutions in three core offerings – renewable energy, hydrogen and 
green mobility to align with changing customers needs.

Other Businesses
Our Upstream business explores and develops hydrocarbon resources and operates oil and gas production assets in 
Malaysia and over 20 countries. PETRONAS, through Malaysia Petroleum Management (MPM), is the country’s oil and gas 
industry shaper and investment enabler that spearheads the growth and development of the nation’s oil and gas industry. 
We continue to strengthen our Upstream performance by delivering focused exploration, efficient development of 
discovered resources and value-driven operations underpinned by a strong focus on Health, Safety and Environment 
(HSE) and integrity. We continue to adopt digitalisation and technology to deliver business excellence. 
We will continue to decarbonise our operations. In 2022, we reduced our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 14.4 per 
cent. We also pursued solutions such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), as evidenced by achieving Final Investment 
Decision (FID) for the Kasawari CO2 Sequestration project, to support PETRONAS’ Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 
(NZCE 2050) Pathway.
Project Delivery and Technology (PD&T) division serves as PETRONAS’ Centre of Excellence (CoE). We shape and support 
the Group’s growth strategies and realise our NZCE 2050 Pathway. We do this through best-in-class project delivery, 
extensive research and development in technology, technical expertise and novel digital solutions.
We continue safeguarding, shaping as well as advancing solutions and positioning future ventures. We are leveraging data 
as an asset, digital as an accelerator and technology as a differentiator. We strive for progress in decarbonisation, value 
creation and business expansion through a well-established and expanding innovation ecosystem to go beyond 
hydrocarbons.
The Gas business is a one-stop centre for lower carbon energy solutions, providing secure natural gas supply to 
customers in Malaysia and abroad through our integrated value chain. As a leading provider of natural gas and Liquefied 
Natural Gas (LNG), we are focused on sustaining world class operational excellence to maximise value from existing 
assets, pursue new projects and supply modes. This will allow us to create new markets and continue fulfilling the 
growing energy needs from power and non-power customers.
We are decarbonising our production footprint and delivering innovative solutions for customers.
With natural gas well-positioned as the transition fuel to shift towards a lower carbon economy, we will continue to take 
deliberate steps in strengthening customer-centricity, operational and commercial excellence, human capital and culture 
development as well as digital and technological innovations. This will be done in pursuit of realising our growth and 
NZCE 2050 Pathway, while supporting the energy security of our customers.
PETRONAS is committed to playing a key role in the energy transition. We are investing in decarbonising our operations 
to achieve our NZCE 2050 Pathway as well as growing our energy offerings as part of our New Business. To this end, 
Gentari was established to pursue opportunities in the energy transition.
Gentari offers cleaner energy solutions through three initial core offerings – renewable energy, hydrogen and green 
mobility, forming a portfolio of solutions cutting across the electron value chain. In the long term, Gentari aims to be an 
integrated clean energy solutions provider, creating greater value, connecting businesses and accelerating the journey to 
net zero.
The Downstream business focuses on enhancing the value of our energy resources, transforming them into high quality, 
value-added products that are distributed to over 90 markets worldwide. Our operations consist of refining, marketing 
and trading crude oil and petroleum products, manufacturing and marketing petrochemical products including derivatives 
and specialty chemicals.
With an extensive retail network of more than 1,000 PETRONAS stations in Malaysia, we offer high-quality fluids and 
lubricants as well as innovative non-fuel offerings such as Setel and Kedai Mesra in 800 locations to make our 
customers’ lives simpler and better. We also own and operate more than 40 Café Mesra that are also available beyond 
PETRONAS retail locations, offering premium quality coffee and pastries for customers on-the-go.
We are expanding our Downstream business by growing in the cleaner energy space with biofuels, circular economy, 
LNG bunkering as well as next generation fluids with PETRONAS Iona Range and installation of charging facilities at our 
PETRONAS stations for Electric Vehicles (EV) in line with our NZCE 2050 Pathway to meet the growing demand for 
lower carbon energy.
Our core businesses are complemented by other businesses, comprising primarily the maritime and logistics segment 
(MISC Berhad or MISC); and the property segment (KLCCP Stapled Group), comprising KLCC Property Holdings Berhad 
and KLCC REIT, constituting 32 per cent of the Malaysian REIT industry, is a subsidiary of PETRONAS that owns and 
manages top-quality assets.

Tan Sri Dato’ Seri 
Mohd Bakke Salleh
Chairman
Letter from the
Chairman
Dear Stakeholder, 
The year in review has proven that the challenges faced by the energy industry has 
never been more uncertain or complex – where heightened volatility is its only 
constant feature.
The world has emerged gradually from the pandemic, 
with most economic sectors steadily recovering. However, 
the Russia – Ukraine conflict has profound implications 
for the energy industry. The conflict unfurled even as the 
world contended with an uneven and still-fragile post-
pandemic recovery. 
Oil and gas supply disruption has pushed up energy 
prices causing widespread inflation throughout the world. 
Elevated general prices globally compelled central banks 
to tighten the monetary policy, even after two years of 
aggressive stimulus packages. 
The convergence of geopolitical instability, economic 
recovery post-pandemic and accelerated energy transition 
have shaped the contour of the energy market. 
Nevertheless, any perceived progress toward energy 
market equilibrium was observed as short-lived.
As a Group, PETRONAS navigated 2022 with a firm 
commitment to ensure the security of energy supply for 
Malaysia and our customers around the world. The 
responsibility was discharged with focused delivery of 
PETRONAS’ strategy, paired with strong integrated 
operational performance to maximise our cash 
generators, and grow the business portfolio. 
I am proud to recognise how our people continued to 
step up and delivered a strong performance for 2022, in 
line with our strategy of creating long-term sustainable 
value and achieving Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 
(NZCE 2050).

Fulfilling Our Amanah to the Nation and the Countries 
Where We Operate 
The PETRONAS Board and Executive Leadership Team were resolute 
in steering the organisation to responsibly manage the hydrocarbon 
resources entrusted to PETRONAS and to grow the size of the value 
pie for the benefit of our stakeholders. 
We contributed to our stakeholders in the form of cash payments, 
tax, export duties, state sales tax and dividends by adopting 
continued prudent financial management and discipline in reinvesting 
to generate profitable growth responsibly and sustainably. 
In 2022, PETRONAS made the scheduled dividend and additional 
dividend payment of RM50 billion in total to the Government of 
Malaysia after careful assessment of the Group’s affordability to 
continue to fund its operations, service its debts and meet its 
obligations as well as invest for the future growth of the 
organisation.
We were resolute 
in responsibly 
managing the 
hydrocarbon 
resources entrusted 
to PETRONAS and 
growing the size 
of the value pie for 
the benefit of our 
stakeholders. 
PETRONAS recognises its responsibility to also create a positive 
social impact for Malaysians and the communities in the 
countries where we operate. In 2022, PETRONAS contributed 
close to RM900 million for its Social Impact activations efforts 
under the pillars of education (Powering Knowledge), community 
well-being and development (Uplifting Lives) and environment 
(Planting Tomorrow). Over 1.5 million people at home and in the 
countries where we operate have benefitted from our Social 
Impact programmes during the year in review. 
PETRONAS also continued to contribute to federal and state 
agencies nationwide to aid flood preparedness efforts in view of 
the year-end monsoon season. The initiative is part of 
PETRONAS’ RM25 million flood assistance contribution 
announced in December 2021, to assist thousands displaced by 
heavy floods in many parts of the country.
PETRONAS’ commitment to Malaysians and the communities we 
serve remains intact, even as we continue to operate in a volatile 
and uncertain business landscape. Anchored on our Statement of 
Purpose, as a progressive energy and solutions partner, we 
recognise the importance of enriching the lives around us.
Seizing Opportunities in the Energy Transition
PETRONAS recognises the need for a responsible energy 
transition and the risk of climate change to its business. At the 
same time, the need to continue investing in reliable sources of 
energy is infinitely clear from the soaring energy prices that 
consumers are having to contend with. 
While oil and gas will remain as our core portfolio, it will be a 
key anchor contributor to cash generation which is especially 
important as the organisation is seizing opportunities to produce 
oil and gas as well as cleaner energy solutions as differentiated 
products that are produced safely, responsibly, cost-optimised 
and emissions-abated. 
Therefore, the decision to declare a NZCE 2050 aspiration was 
both to demonstrate our stronger commitment to sustainability, 
as well as galvanise us as an organisation towards the necessary 
shifts and changes that would be needed to achieve such a 
target. 
PETRONAS contributed 
close to 
RM900
million 
in 2022 for Social Impact 
activations.
Over 1.5 million

Upholding our Shared Values as a Trusted Partner
The PETRONAS Shared Values of Loyalty, Integrity, Professionalism and Cohesiveness have long been the defining 
qualities that have drawn collaborating parties into genuine partnerships with PETRONAS. We believe in recognising the 
aspirations of our valued stakeholders from the Federal Government of Malaysia, State Governments and the 
Governments of our host countries, industry partners and customers.
Over the years, PETRONAS is honoured and grateful to have the strong support of our stakeholders as we strive to 
continue realising their aspirations through commercial arrangements and contributions.
In this respect, at this time of uncertainty and turbulence with the energy transition rapidly evolving the energy 
landscape – it is important for PETRONAS to continuously adapt and transform itself to continue becoming the 
progressive energy and solutions partner our stakeholders would seek.
2022 is also a year that we bid farewell to a member of 
our Board of Directors, Puan Zakiah Jaafar. I would like to 
express my sincere thanks and appreciation for her 
contribution. Her experience and insights have been 
valuable for the organisation and we wish her every 
success in her new undertakings. 
At this opportunity, I would like to extend a warm 
welcome to our new Board members namely, Datuk Seri 
Asri Hamidon and Datuk Johan Mahmood Merican 
(Alternate Director). These new additions to the Board 
collectively bring diversity of perspectives and wealth of 
experience that will be crucial to PETRONAS.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to extend my 
heartiest appreciation to Datuk Tengku Muhammad Taufik, 
President and Group CEO of PETRONAS, and his 
Executive Leadership Team for delivering our business 
strategies with pace and agility, whilst strengthening our 
foundation for future growth. My deepest gratitude also to 
our employees for their courage and perseverance in fully 
embracing our statement of purpose, shared values and 
holding the organisation to high standards of safety and 
integrity.
Finally, to our valued stakeholders – I would like to 
express my deep gratitude for the trust and confidence in 
PETRONAS that will see us pave the way for more shared 
successes to come. Let us continue to make a positive 
difference by providing energy for the betterment of 
societies today and for generations to come. 
Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Mohd Bakke Salleh
Chairman
Fortifying core activities in 
a differentiated manner 
that continues supporting 
the needs of a growing 
population and economic 
expansion by producing 
hydrocarbons at reduced 
emissions and ensuring 
competitive costs. 
Pursuing a credible  
NZCE 2050 Pathway and 
identified key abatement 
levers to reduce our 
carbon emissions with 
short-medium and long-
term targets that support 
Malaysia’s commitment to 
its Nationally Determined 
Contribution in support of 
the Paris Agreement.
Diversifying into new 
energy transition 
businesses that are 
cleaner, less emissions-
intensive, and a more 
equitable energy system 
aligned with changing 
consumers and market 
preferences.
As a result, the PETRONAS Board has endorsed the PETRONAS Energy Transition Strategy that will see the organisation 
intensify delivery of its growth strategy with pace, supported by consistent investment allocation to support our NZCE 
2050 aspiration:
The Board also focused on strengthening PETRONAS’ business resilience for long-term sustainability. Among the 
sustainability-related governance initiatives approved by the Board include PETRONAS Corporate Risk Profile and 
endorsement of PETRONAS’ position on Nature and Biodiversity.
To this end, the Board remains resolute in its 
commitment to ensure PETRONAS demonstrates best 
practices in transparency, governance, reporting frequency 
and profitability in creating and delivering long-term 
sustainable value.
In this same stride, PETRONAS will continue to uphold 
the highest standards of integrity and safety, in 
discharging our obligations and responsibilities as a 
national oil company and global energy player.
The organisation has in place a Code of Conduct and 
Business Ethics, the PETRONAS four Sustainability Lenses 
and other relevant commitments. PETRONAS also has a 
zero-tolerance approach against bribery and corruption 
with strict consequence management.
As we continue to expand our presence across the globe, 
PETRONAS will continue to enhance and safeguard our 
ability to uphold the trust of our stakeholders by 
exercising respect and abide by the relevant laws and 
regulations of Malaysia and the countries where we 
operate.
The Year Ahead
As we look ahead to 2023, the oil and gas industry could 
potentially see prices moderating given an anticipated 
economic slowdown, on the back of prolonged market 
volatility. In this environment, PETRONAS will continue to 
drive operational excellence in our core business while we 
pursue our growth and sustainability targets.
On the back of the strong performance recorded this 
year, PETRONAS will no doubt progress with the drive, 
passion and spirit to provide energy for shared prosperity 
in a just and responsible approach to energy transition.

Executive 
Officer
Datuk Tengku 
Muhammad Taufik
President and  
Group Chief Executive Officer
Esteemed Stakeholder, 
Two years have now passed since the pandemic began, and 
the world in 2022 grappled with the challenges of an 
uneven and fragile post-pandemic recovery. Even as you 
read this, the world continues to remain vulnerable to the 
combined threat of geopolitical conflict, the rising cost of 
living, energy and climate crises.
Energy security concerns are still top of mind for leaders 
globally as chronic underinvestment and shrinking spare 
capacity continued to roil already-volatile energy markets. At 
the same time, many countries and companies remained 
steadfast in their longer-term commitment to the Paris 
Agreement. 
With these realities in mind, PETRONAS responded by 
executing our strategy aligned to our Net Zero Carbon 
Emissions by 2050 Pathway. The Group is committed to 
deliver energy for the growing needs of today and develop 
solutions that will help us move closer to a lower-carbon 
future. 
PETRONAS sees the energy transition as an opportunity as 
much as it is a responsibility to produce oil and gas 
alongside cleaner energy solutions as differentiated products 
that are safe, responsibly produced, cost-optimised and 
emission-abated for our customers. 
I am proud to share that PETRONAS made substantial 
progress during the year in review and strengthened our 
portfolio in order to be well-positioned to continue creating 
long-term sustainable value.
Alhamdulillah, in this stride PETRONAS recorded a strong 
performance in 2022, encapsulating our commitment to 
solving the energy needs of our customers as their 
progressive energy and solutions partner enriching lives for a 
sustainable future. 
With a motivated and passionate workforce driving our 
efforts, I remain confident that the PETRONAS Group is on 
track to deliver meaningfully towards a just and responsible 
energy transition.
We executed our 
strategy aligned to 
our Net Zero Carbon 
Emissions by 2050 
Pathway. The Group is 
committed to deliver 
energy for the growing 
needs of today and 
develop solutions that 
will help us move closer 
to a lower-carbon 
future.

Safety of Our People
PETRONAS’ priority is to undertake our 
business activities with an unwavering focus 
and emphasis on safety.
For an industry that is unavoidably hazardous 
and fraught with risks, our employees and 
partners delivered our strong performance in 
2022 with diligence and dedication to 
upholding safety as our license to operate 
responsibly and sustainably. However, we also 
had challenges.
Regrettably, we recorded four incidents which 
resulted in the loss of lives. The Group 
responded by identifying its root causes and 
has undertaken the necessary actions to 
prevent any recurrence. We aim to do better 
by strengthening our guidelines and processes 
to ensure we create a safe working 
environment. PETRONAS is committed to 
stepping up with our partners and contractors 
to nurture a generative health, safety and 
environment (HSE) culture where everyone 
returns home safely as a shared responsibility.
Delivering Excellence: Performance Highlights
In line with our industry peers, in 2022 PETRONAS delivered a robust 
full-year performance with Profit After Tax registered at RM101.6 billion 
on the back of RM375.3 billion in revenue. EBITDA stood at 
RM170.7 billion for the year in review. 
Throughout the year in review, PETRONAS focused on commercial 
and operational excellence of our integrated value chain, supported by 
an upward surge in commodity prices in an environment heightened 
by supply-demand volatility driven by sudden shifts in the market and 
an accelerated energy transition. 
Amid an uncertain and volatile business operating environment, 
PETRONAS continued to exercise prudent financial management and 
made every effort to reinvest with discipline to future-proof the 
portfolio and preserve our ability to deliver profitable growth 
responsibly and sustainably.
Our priority is in reinvesting towards reshaping and decarbonising our 
portfolio – which means continuing to explore, develop and produce 
hydrocarbons that the markets we serve still need, but with greater 
efficiency and lower emissions. 
We intensified our efforts and progressed steadily in our strategy with 
milestones that include:
• 
First significant oil discovery in Brazil’s Sepia field made with an 
asset designed with gas and CO2 reinjection to lower the 
emissions from its operations. PETRONAS also won the Agua 
Marinha exploration block in the Campos Basin with our 
consortium partners.
PETRONAS is 
committed to stepping 
up with our partners 
and contractors to 
nurture a generative 
HSE culture where 
everyone returns home 
safely as a shared 
responsibility.
• 
Agreement with Abu Dhabi National Oil 
Company (ADNOC) to explore and appraise its 
first-ever unconventional oil concession, 
incorporating plans to manage GHG emissions.
• 
Expanded PETRONAS Chemicals Group Berhad 
(PCG)‘s future offerings for the market with the 
acquisition of Perstorp Holding AB, a global 
leader in specialty chemicals.
• 
Entered Australia’s renewable energy market 
with Gentari’s acquisition of WIRSOL Energy, a 
leading renewable energy solutions provider 
with integrated solar and battery energy storage 
system capabilities. 
• 
Partnership with Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 
team to develop advanced sustainable fuel for 
the sport and consumers. 
• 
Portfolio high grading for our assets in South 
Sudan, Chad and South Africa are currently 
ongoing. 
In the same stride, it is with pleasure that I also 
share that PETRONAS pursued more partnerships at 
home and internationally to capture opportunities 
in the energy transition.
• 
Collaboration with Sabah and Sarawak to 
expand value creation opportunities in lower 
carbon solutions which include Final Investment 
Decision for Sabah’s first nearshore LNG facility 
and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with 
Sarawak Economic Development Corporation 
(SEDC) Energy to develop green hydrogen 
technologies and renewable oil from algae.

a US$250 million hackathon to seek out decarbonisation ideas 
and solutions. The winners have been identified to scale and 
deploy their innovations within 24 months to accelerate 
PETRONAS’ journey to Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050.
PETRONAS is on a stronger footing today, having laid the 
necessary foundation with our strategy and ambition for Net 
Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050. We will continue to strengthen 
our portfolio and pursue new opportunities for growth to 
provide more energy with lower emissions to remain relevant 
and resilient in the energy transition.
Progressing with Purpose: Our Strategic Journey
The frequency and magnitude of energy disruptions seen over 
the past year indicate the need for a balanced approach to the 
transition. We have observed the widespread economic 
implications when an immediate switch from hydrocarbons, 
before an attempt is made to realise an alternative energy 
system is fully ready to shoulder the heavy burden of global 
demand. 
At the end of the day, PETRONAS believes it is about getting 
the balance right with secure, affordable and sustainable energy. 
For PETRONAS, we intend to seize the opportunities and provide 
the world with the energy it needs today with consideration for 
the climate goals of the Paris Agreement. Our priority is to be 
in step with the progress of the societies we serve. 
The myriad of 
challenges in 
energy transition 
are complex, but it 
is our duty to take 
credible actions 
to chart a viable 
pathway to net zero 
carbon emissions.

PETRONAS is driven to accelerate our efforts towards 
shaping a just and responsible energy transition with 
equitable outcomes where nobody is left behind. In this 
regard, I am pleased to share that we have crystallised 
our Three-Pronged Growth Strategy into the PETRONAS 
Energy Transition Strategy that will see us grow our 
business profitably and responsibly with a clear ambition 
to be a ‘progressive energy and solutions partner’ for a 
lower carbon future.
The myriad of challenges in energy transition are 
complex, but it is our duty to take credible actions to 
fulfil our commitment. The Energy Transition Strategy will 
see PETRONAS take bold yet realistic and deliberate steps 
with investments undertaken towards:
• 
Accelerating and intensifying exploration, development 
and production of Malaysia’s oil and gas fields with a 
focus on becoming a low cost and low emissions 
producer. 
• 
Providing greater access to gas and LNG as a 
transition fuel. 
• 
Capitalising on the opportunities of high commodity 
prices for our Downstream business through 
continuous operational and commercial excellence.
• 
Advancing our ambition to establish Malaysia as a 
carbon capture and storage (CCS) hub for the region. 
• 
Providing customers with cleaner energy solutions 
such as renewable energy, hydrogen and green 
mobility under Gentari. 
• 
Offering lower carbon maritime services and solutions. 
Delivery of these efforts is anchored to our Net Zero 
Carbon Emissions by 2050 Pathway which sets out in 
detail the short, medium and long-term targets to 
manage emissions from our operations and strengthen 
the resilience of our business. 
As we look ahead, PETRONAS will require significant 
investments to chart a viable pathway to net zero carbon 
emissions. To this end, we have committed up to 
20  per  cent annual CAPEX for the next five years to 
intensify our decarbonisation efforts and pursuits in 
cleaner energy solutions. 
Consequently, I believe these efforts will continue to 
support key government stakeholders in shaping a 
conducive ecosystem for investments in cleaner energy 
solutions to thrive and contribute long-term to Malaysia’s 
Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris 
Agreement. 
I look forward to sharing more exciting updates with you 
in due course.

Nurturing Talent and Shaping an Ecosystem to 
Thrive
At PETRONAS, our people are our greatest asset. 
We recognise that a shifting energy landscape will require 
significant focus on building a sustainable pipeline of 
talent equipped to keep pace with change and embrace 
the energy transition. 
In 2022, we invested RM264 million in employee training 
and development programmes towards improving core 
competencies and new skills to improve our competitive 
advantage in delivering the PETRONAS Energy Transition 
Strategy.
As we position the company for the future, our 
employees will continue to uphold accountability for the 
resources entrusted to PETRONAS. Our Shared Values of 
Integrity, Professionalism, Cohesiveness and Loyalty will 
continue to guide our actions and conduct as a trusted 
partner for our stakeholders.
From an ecosystem perspective, we recognise that we 
can only achieve a lower carbon future with support and 
effective coordination from our industry partners.
PETRONAS acknowledges its role as a catalyst for 
Malaysia’s Oil and Gas Services and Equipment (OGSE) 
sector. Accordingly, PETRONAS remains committed to 
working with our partners, especially as the business 
environment demands the industry to decarbonise 
operations as part of the energy transition. 
The Group has initiated programmes to elevate the 
robustness of the OGSE as far back as 1993. The Vendor 
Development Programme (VDP), VDPx programme, 
Vendor Financing Programme by Financial Institutions and 
the Road to Bursa Programme are among the initiatives 
to improve the resiliency and maintain the stability of the 
ecosystem at large.
PETRONAS remains committed to increasing domestic 
investment as outlined in the PETRONAS Activity Outlook 
on the oil and gas activities planned for the next three 
years. Nevertheless, our OGSE partners must also pursue 
innovation in lower-carbon technologies to be 
competitive globally.
With a resilient OGSE ecosystem, I am confident that the 
energy industry will continue to effectively contribute to 
Malaysia’s economic growth.
Forging Ahead
Along with the Board and leadership of PETRONAS, I am 
grateful that PETRONAS’ performance in 2022 has enabled 
the Company to continue delivering long-term sustainable 
value with discipline as a national oil company (NOC). In 
the same stride, the execution of our strategy 
demonstrates our continued focus on future-proofing the 
portfolio with a solid foundation to intensify our growth 
as a global energy player.
We remain committed to growing the value pie for our 
stakeholders and OGSE partners to thrive alongside 
PETRONAS. We will also continue to discharge our duty 
in ensuring the well-being of Malaysians and societies 
wherever we operate with secure, affordable and 
sustainable energy.
As the macro environment will continue to be shaped by 
the events of 2022 – PETRONAS must remain cautious 
and rigorously ensure prudent financial management while 
strengthening our integrated value chain with a sharper 
focus on commercial and operational excellence. Even as 
we do this, we will also exercise equally firm discipline in 
reinvesting for our future growth to deliver our Energy 
Transition Strategy.
As we gear towards seizing opportunities for profitable 
growth, we will do so responsibly and sustainably with 
integrity and professionalism.
Permit me to place on record my utmost gratitude to 
the employees of PETRONAS for their dedication and 
valuable contribution to the Group’s performance. 
I  would also like to extend my appreciation to our 
Chairman, Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Mohd Bakke Salleh and 
members of the PETRONAS Board of Directors for their 
stewardship and counsel for the Company to remain 
resilient amid prolonged marked volatility. I would also 
like to acknowledge the PETRONAS Executive Leadership 
for their collective effort in strengthening our portfolio 
to continue pursuing growth and progress towards our 
sustainability targets. My sincere thanks to our valued 
stakeholders – Federal and State Governments, the 
Host Governments of our international operations, 
agencies and authorities, our business partners, 
vendors and customers for their trust in PETRONAS. 
Executing a just and responsible energy transition is 
an agenda that must progress as we contemplate 
and accept our responsibility to the next generation. 
With unwavering commitment, PETRONAS remains 
resolute in its mission and will drive action across all 
our stakeholders to shape an energy future that will 
benefit all.

The Financial Year in Review
The year 2022 was a time of heightened uncertainty 
and volatility for the oil and gas industry. The ongoing 
conflict between Russia and Ukraine triggered energy 
price spikes and supply chain disruptions, bringing with 
it concerns over energy security. Even as supply 
concerns emerged, the call for energy transition 
remains strong with augmented demand for cleaner 
energy. Investors and financial institutions are putting a 
high level of scrutiny on oil and gas players to ensure 
we measure up to what we have committed in terms 
of climate change, emissions targets and cleaner 
energy sources.
Amidst the confluence of these seemingly opposing 
factors, PETRONAS leveraged on our strong integrated 
value chain, demonstrated agility and resilience to 
capitalise on the opportunities from the market 
uptrends. We remain focused on delivering our strategy 
and Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050) 
Pathway by exercising discipline in capital allocation. As 
a global energy player with commitments and 
responsibilities towards uplifting communities and 
supporting net zero ambitions in Malaysia as well as

PETRONAS leverages its strong 
portfolio and integrated value 
chain to capture opportunities 
from the market uptrends, 
delivering a sterling financial 
performance for the year 2022.
the countries where we operate, we are future-proofing our 
portfolio by investing responsibly to preserve our ability to 
deliver long-term value to provide energy that is secure, 
affordable and sustainable. 
Our Profit After Tax (PAT) for FY2022 was RM101.6 billion, a 
100 per cent higher than RM50.9 billion in FY2021. This was 
driven by the substantial increase in revenue, as well as the 
effectiveness of our prudent financial management that we 
continue to practice. Our PAT Margin for FY2022 was

operational excellence as well as effective cost 
control measures. Some examples of such 
measures include fuel consumption management 
and vessel optimisation.
Our revenue for FY2022 was RM375.3 billion 
compared to RM248.0 billion in FY2021, 
representing a 51 per cent increase. The 
substantial rise in revenue was driven by higher 
average realised prices for all products against the 
backdrop of concerns in relation to energy 
security, coupled with favourable impact from 
foreign exchange. More than 70 per cent of 
PETRONAS’ revenue was contributed by 
customers outside Malaysia, demonstrating our 
strong global presence. 
Our Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation 
and Amortisation (EBITDA) for FY2022 was 
RM170.7 billion, a 70 per cent increase in line 
with the higher profit recorded.
Businesses across the value chain took bold choices and displayed 
operational resilience and commercial excellence, allowing us to 
capture market uptrends, resulting in the strong financial 
performance.
Strong Financial Position
The unpredictable energy markets, coupled with the possibility 
of a global economic slowdown as well as rising inflation has 
led to increase in operating costs. Despite these challenges, 
PETRONAS continues to maintain its strong liquidity by 
exercising effective cost management and delivering solid 
financial performance.
We recorded robust cash flows from operating activities of 
RM135.3 billion, a 72 per cent increase from FY2021, enabling 
us to increase investments required for growth, make higher 
dividend payments, service our debt obligations and increase 
contributions to support economic and social development. 
Additionally, we recorded gearing of 20.3 per cent in FY2022, 
2.8 per cent lower than FY2021. This strengthened the Group’s 
net cash position to RM108.0 billion. Our net cash position 
compares favourably with that of our peer group comprising 
international oil majors.
Total assets stood at RM710.6 billion as at 31 December 2022, 
an increase of 12 per cent against the previous year. This was 
mainly contributed by the higher cash position as well as higher 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets following 
new acquisitions during the year.
Capital Allocation
Amid the continued volatility of the energy market and the 
increasing call for energy transition, we remain steadfast in 
strengthening our portfolio through strict capital discipline, 
ensuring sufficient allocation for our core cash generators, as 
well as investments in new business and intensify emissions 
abatement efforts.
As activity started to pick up across the globe, our capital 
investment spending in FY2022 grew 65 per cent from the 
previous year to RM50.1 billion. 25 per cent of the capital 
investment spent in FY2022 was on New Business.

Domestic Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) increased by 
24 per cent against the same period last year, 
contributing to the growth of the Malaysian oil and 
gas industry.
International CAPEX also increased as investments 
were channeled mainly to non-traditional businesses 
such as specialty chemicals. Excluding international 
acquisitions made during the year, the CAPEX spent 
was almost equal for Malaysia and international 
projects. 
Capital investment allocation over the next five years 
i.e. between FY2023 to FY2027 is expected to be 43 
per cent higher than the last five years i.e. between 
FY2018 to FY2022, mainly as a result of scaling up 
investments in the core business, lowering our 
emissions as well as investing in new business to 
future-proof the Group’s portfolio.

Dear Stakeholder,
Over the past year, PETRONAS has made significant progress in our sustainability journey. We 
continued integrating sustainability in our strategic execution and the future of our business. As a 
global energy company, this is no simple feat. Our ability to create long-term value is not only 
driven by market forces – we also have broader responsibilities to bear. We are committed to 
contribute towards government efforts to decarbonise economic development while delivering 
reliable energy that supports progressive growth. Our impact is far-reaching and we remain 
steadfast in using our scale, technology and talents to provide the energy solutions our customers 
desire for a sustainable future. Therefore, I am pleased to share my assessment of the Group’s 
sustainability performance and journey for 2022.

We remain steadfast in using 
our scale, technology and 
talents to provide the energy 
solutions our customers desire 
for a sustainable future.
Trends Signal a Sustainable Energy Future 
2022 was another tumultuous year. The extraordinary 
health crisis brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, was 
overtaken by a global energy crisis, high inflation, supply 
disruptions and compounding effects of climate change. 
Instability continues to surround economic activity, 
weakening long-term prospects for global growth and 
social progress. Energy security remains a key concern for 
political leaders across the world, yet the underlying trend 
of decarbonisation remains strong with renewed 
momentum.
Despite volatile geopolitics, addressing climate change, 
nature loss and persistent inequality continue to serve as 
a common ground for international collaboration. The 
United Nations convened conferences on climate change 
(COP27) and biodiversity (COP15) in 2022 demonstrated 
strong participation and engagement by all relevant 
parties. Overall, sustainability considerations continue to 
drive developments in public policy, regulation, investment 
decisions and business development. 
The scale of change brought on by the energy transition 
is hard to overstate. Today, we see transformative policy 
instruments at play internationally, driving large-scale shifts 
into new renewable and low carbon energy value chains. 
In Malaysia, broad climate aspirations are translated into 
more specific policy developments and practical deliveries. 
The National Energy Policy (NEP 2040) was launched in 
September 2022. It frames the context for optimising the 
value of national oil and gas resources, while capitalising 
on growth opportunities from the global energy transition. 
NEP 2040 presents low carbon growth pathways that 
include a higher share of renewable energy, financing and 
incentives to drive energy efficiency, green mobility, 
hydrogen, circular economy, biofuels and carbon capture, 
utilisation and storage (CCUS).
In December 2022, Bursa Malaysia Bhd launched the 
Bursa Carbon Exchange (BCX), a voluntary carbon market 
and the world’s first shariah-compliant carbon exchange.
A Sustainable Approach to Value
The strong emphasis we have on sustainability gives 
PETRONAS a vital understanding of how changes in 
society affect our risk landscape. It helps us be 
responsive, operate effectively, align new opportunities for 
investment and attract talents. We do not see a trade-off 
between value creation and sustainability. We can only 
succeed, if we use our scale, technology and skills to 
provide the energy solutions our customers desire.
Each country has energy accessibility, affordability and 
sustainability concerns that require tailored responses. 
PETRONAS is building strength and expertise in responding 
effectively to the evolving context in energy markets, 
while balancing short-term demands of continued energy 
supply with long-term responsible growth. 
In support of our strategy, we have launched our Net 
Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050) Pathway 
that sets clear milestone targets for reducing our 
operational emissions and frames our growth ambitions in 
new areas.
Becoming a Net Zero Energy Company
For PETRONAS, we intend to capture the opportunities 
and provide the world with the energy it needs with 
consideration for the climate goals of the Paris Agreement. 
With our integrated energy portfolio, we serve as the 
custodian of Malaysia’s hydrocarbon resources, while 
transforming in line with our published NZCE 2050 Pathway. 
Our NZCE 2050 Pathway stipulates emissions reduction from 
our own operations and growth ambitions for clean energy 
solutions, enabled by a 20 per cent allocation of total capital 
expenditure over the period of 2022-2026. Delivery of 
these targets is anchored on our business context, national 
policies, international frameworks and scientific consensus 
on climate change.
2022 saw growth in our energy production, after the 
disruptive years of the COVID-19 pandemic prior. Our 
Groupwide absolute greenhouse gas emissions have also 
risen. While some of it can be attributed to changes in our 
accounting method, we are determined to decouple growth 
of our business from emissions. To this aim, we have set 
ourselves absolute emissions targets.
Our near-term target is to cap operational emissions at 49.5 
million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Million tCO2e) 
by 2024 in Malaysia. Our 2030 target is to achieve a 25 
per cent absolute emissions reduction Groupwide, based 
on 2019 emissions data, for our own emissions and the 
emissions from the energy we buy (Scopes 1 and 2).

We are on track to meet our 2024 target and we have 
reduced our GHG emissions by 8.49 per cent against our 
2030 target of 25 per cent absolute emissions reduction 
against 2019 baseline.
Our targets include specific provisions for methane 
emissions reduction: 50 per cent by 2025 and 70 per cent by 
2030, from 2019 levels, for PETRONAS’ groupwide natural 
gas value chain. In support of Malaysia’s commitment to 
the Global Methane Pledge of reducing national methane 
emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 from 2020 levels, 
PETRONAS is going beyond its own operations and has 
set a 50 per cent methane emissions reduction target for 
Malaysia’s natural gas value chain. 
Key levers for reducing our operational emissions are: zero 
routine flaring and venting, energy efficiency, electrification 
and carbon capture and storage (CCS). 
CCS is an essential component in global decarbonisation, 
providing substantive emissions reduction potential for 
oil and gas and hard-to-abate industrial sectors. Towards 
this aim, we now have a centralised Carbon Management 
Division to drive emissions management, including CCS, 
laying the foundation for such practice in Malaysia to serve 
both domestic and international commercial industrial 
customers.
Gentari has been established to deliver clean energy 
solutions that will assist customers to achieve their 
respective net zero carbon emission aspirations. Gentari has 
strong growth ambitions for 2030: 30-40GW of renewable 
energy capacity, up to 1.2 million tonnes per annum of 
hydrogen and 10 per cent market share of public electric 
charging points across Asia Pacific. 
We are also making inroads into the biofuels market with 
plans for a greenfield biorefinery and co-processing at 
existing facilities, slated for 2025. The biorefinery will provide 
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) with operational flexibility and 
generate hydrogenated vegetable oil or renewable diesel. 
We launched our NZCE 2050 Pathway to our top leaders 
in October 2022, followed by master classes to ensure a 
common vision and accelerated delivery by our highly skilled 
engineering teams, across all parts of the business.
The targets set forth by the NZCE 2050 Pathway are bold 
and ambitious. Buoyed by strong performance of the past 
decade of reducing emissions by 18.1 million tonnes of 
carbon dioxide equivalent cumulatively and our recent 
impactful acquisitions of specialty chemicals businesses with 
strong sustainability credentials, will hold us in a good stead 
to reach our stretch targets. 
In support of our NZCE 2050 Pathway, since 2022, senior 
leader’s long-term incentive plan includes a 20 per cent 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) element 
encompassing measures relating to the attainment of our 
Pathway and diversity and inclusion.
Protecting Our Natural Environment
In December 2022, the United Nations brokered a milestone 
agreement of halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030 
through conserving at least 30 per cent of land, freshwater 
and oceans globally. 
We recognise the importance of conserving nature and 
biodiversity and the interlinkages with climate change. Both 
areas need to be addressed in parallel. This is why with the 
approval of the PETRONAS Board, we have established 
PETRONAS’ Position on Nature and Biodiversity, through 
which wherever possible, we aim to conserve, protect and 
restore nature. 
As one of the most recognised brands in the region, we 
see the need to demonstrate visible leadership in countries 
where we operate, not least in Malaysia that is regarded as 
one of only 17 mega biodiversity countries in the world. 
To attain net zero carbon emissions by 2050, PETRONAS will 
require carbon offsets for residual emissions that cannot be 
avoided or mitigated. For this purpose, PETRONAS will invest 
in nature-based solutions. 
Our near-term target is to 
cap operational emissions 
at 49.5 Million tCO2e by 
2024 in Malaysia.
Letter from the Vice President and 
Chief Sustainability Officer
In Malaysia, we promote the development of high-quality 
nature-based projects to generate carbon credits certified 
in accordance with credible international standards. Project 
development would help channel much needed funds 
towards land use impact mitigation, forest conservation, 
peatland management, as well as mangrove, seagrass and 
coral reef conservation.
Environmental management remains a key focus for our 
continuous improvement efforts. During 2022, we saw a 
negative trend for some of our key indicators, most notably 
for sulphur oxide emissions and hazardous waste, which we 
are determined to reverse in the coming year.
Supporting Our People and Enriching Lives
The safety and well-being of our employees, contractors and 
surrounding communities is central to the success of our 
daily operations. 
In 2022, we placed a particular importance on employees’ 
mental well-being. Our Executive Leadership Team was 
directly involved through sharing of personal experiences, 
thus lifting the stigma that may typically be associated with 
mental health issues. An end-to-end prevention and support 
programme was established, with early signs of making a 
positive impact. During the year, efforts to enhance diversity 
and inclusion were undertaken to create a more progressive 
work environment, focusing on leadership and governance, 
communication, education and culture. 
Recognising the need to upskill existing talents to deliver our 
NZCE 2050 Pathway, we have also prioritised sustainability 
capability development. Beyond our own workforce, our 
extensive value chain and global presence exposes the 
Group to potential human or labour rights breaches, which 
will only broaden through the energy transition that implies 
new interactions, business relations and infrastructure 
development. Thus, we continue to strengthen our 
approaches to respect human rights, guided by the United 
Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
Third party assurance of suppliers’ and vendors’ requirements 
to uphold human rights, showed some level of awareness, 
but with further work required to uplift human rights 
commitments and delivery of such.

We are also committed to contribute to the well-being 
and development of surrounding communities. In 2022, 
close to RM900 million was invested towards Social Impact 
programmes, benefitting over 1.5 million beneficiaries 
worldwide. Ninety five per cent of the amount invested 
focused on education, including a doubling of scholarships 
to directly benefit 587 students. We have also enhanced 
efforts to increase the marketability of unemployed 
Malaysian graduates through the Graduate Employability 
Enhancement Scheme (GEES), benefitting 4,683 graduates 
with a total contribution of RM73.7 million since the 
inception of the programme.
Transparency in Sustainability Performance and 
Promoting Good Governance
Brand Finance ranked PETRONAS as the most valuable 
ASEAN brand in terms of sustainability perceptions. This 
achievement was undoubtedly helped by our efforts to 
strengthen transparency of our sustainability impacts and 
performance.
As we uphold the principle of accountability and earning 
trust with key stakeholders, we strive to improve both 
internal management reporting of key sustainability 
indicators, as well as external disclosure of our strategies and 
performance in line with recognised international disclosure 
frameworks. 
We have revised our carbon emissions accounting method 
to adhere to sector-specific guidance and to give us a 
robust emissions baseline. Our strengthened reporting 
will improve external benchmarking and provide a better 
correlation between financial and greenhouse gas emissions 
accounting. To this aim, we account for our methane 
emissions, flaring and venting management through the 
publicly available reports issued by the Methane Guiding 
Principles and the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring by 
2030 initiative and report through CDP (formerly Carbon 
Disclosure Project). 
New for this integrated report, is our phased adoption of 
climate-related disclosures as per the recommendations 
of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD). These disclosures will provide greater transparency 
around our approach to climate risk. 
Throughout the year, efforts were underway to drive 
accountability and embed sustainability in advisory bodies 
and decision-making processes across the enterprise. While 
this work is still underway, important milestones include 
board deliberations around the development of the Pathway 
to Net Zero Carbon Emission 2050 and the introduction of 
sustainability-linked key performance indicators in senior 
leadership’s long-term incentive plans. 
Promoting Progress Through Engagement and 
Partnerships
The challenge of achieving net zero carbon emissions is 
too complex for any organisation to deliver on its own. To 
create momentum on the need to accelerate and scale up 
sustainable business models, we have continued to elevate 
our engagement with a broad set of discussion partners 
nationally and internationally.
The Malaysian Oil and Gas Services and Equipment (OGSE) 
ecosystem is facing raised expectations on environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) grounds. In response, the 
Malaysia Petroleum Resource Corporation (MPRC) is 
devising a national OGSE sustainability strategy. PETRONAS 
also works with vendors to identify barriers and help 
define opportunities for greater ESG adoption among local 
businesses. 
Malaysia recently launched a voluntary carbon trading facility 
and has plans to develop a domestic emissions trading 
scheme. These are regarded as important instruments to 
drive the country’s net zero ambitions. In support of this aim, 
PETRONAS has joined the International Emissions Trading 
Association (IETA).
At a regional level, we are active in the APEC Business 
Advisory Council (ABAC). In 2022, we delivered a proposal 
around building Small and Medium Enterprises’ resilience 
in a low-carbon economy. We also joined the International 
Renewable Energy Agency’s Alliance for Industry 
Decarbonisation to foster action for the decarbonisation 
of industrial value chains, promote understanding of 
renewables-based solutions and their adoption by industry 
to contribute to country-specific net zero goals.
With our commitments and 
plans to address climate 
change and nature loss in 
place, next, we will engage 
with stakeholders across 
our value chain to better 
understand what a just and 
equitable energy transition 
may look like and what our 
role should be. 
Letter from the Vice President and 
Chief Sustainability Officer
Furthermore, we are active contributors towards the Global 
Methane Pledge Energy Pathway and other regional and 
global initiatives that address methane emissions in oil 
and gas value chains. In 2022, we signed up to the United 
Nations Environment Programme’s Oil and Gas Methane 
Partnership 2.0. Through this initiative, we strive to improve 
the accuracy and transparency of our methane emissions 
reporting, guided by a comprehensive and measurement-
based reporting framework.
Since 2021, we have convened the ASEAN Energy 
Sector Methane Roundtable, in collaboration with PTT 
Public Company Limited (PTT) of Thailand, Pertamina of 
Indonesia and since last year the United States Agency 
for International Development (USAID). The roundtables 
continue to engage a diverse set of stakeholders from 
across ASEAN through information sharing, technical 
exchange and open conversations, to advance 
strong performance and effective methane emissions 
management.
Outlook
Economic growth across Southeast Asia will put 
decarbonisation and broader sustainability goals to the test. 
Each country and each sector need tailored approaches 
to unlock new business models, without compromising 
broader development. Conducive policy and regulation 
will be critical in defining country-specific pathways and in 
unlocking private sector investment for the next generation 
of energy systems. 
During the year, we stepped up in many ways, from 
setting measurable targets for our Pathway to Net Zero 
Carbon Emission by 2050 to investing in real emissions 
reduction projects, renewables and clean energy solutions. 
PETRONAS’ leading stance on sustainability will not only 
grow the business, but galvanise innovation, investment 
and long-term sustainable growth.
For PETRONAS to succeed at speed and scale we will 
need to work even more intensely across sectors. New 
value chains need to be defined and deployed. Such can 
only be achieved through greater collaboration between 
the private sector, regulators and investors internationally 
to realise the benefits of e.g., carbon capture and storage 
(CCS), hydrogen, biofuels and nature-based solutions fully.
The energy transition is not just a technology and 
investment play, the associated large-scale investments 
is a once in a generation opportunity to strengthen social 
progress and reverse nature loss. As Malaysia’s oil and gas 
resource custodian, we strive for socially inclusive and 
sustainable resource development. 
With our commitments and plans to address climate 
change and nature loss in place, next, we will engage with 
stakeholders across our value chain to better understand 
what a just and equitable energy transition may look like 
and what our role should be. 
The coming year will undoubtedly continue to be volatile. 
As we move forward, we will encounter obstacles in 
advancing sustainability and an equitable energy transition. 
However as demonstrated over recent years, PETRONAS 
remains resilient. Our focus on sustainability and strategic 
priorities coupled with milestone achievements will cement 
our position as a dynamic and reliable partner in the energy 
transition set for long-term success.

Monitor Risks And Opportunities
Our ability to create value is closely linked to the global macroeconomic landscape 
and its impact on the energy industry. To stay ahead, we closely analyse the factors 
that influence the macroenvironment in relation to our business and operations. This 
helps us to identify potential trends and opportunities, enabling us to adapt our 
strategies and make informed decisions that optimise our value creation capabilities.
As we expand our portfolio to include cleaner energy solutions, we understand the 
importance of managing the evolving needs of our stakeholders. We proactively 
engage in meaningful dialogues, collaborations and engagements on various 
platforms. This strengthens our position as a trustworthy and credible partner.
With a fully integrated value chain covering upstream, gas, downstream and clean 
energy, we are exposed to risks and opportunities associated to the energy transition. 
To ensure the resilience and robustness of our energy portfolio, we continually 
monitor all risks and effectively mitigate them through our risk management 
processes. We also view each risk as an opportunity to enhance our operations and 
to drive our business forward.
Embedding Ethical Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Practices
Our ability to create value for 
stakeholders is influenced by a range 
of environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) factors. To ensure we address 
the issues that matter to our stakeholders, 
we identified material topics that are 
closely related or could impact them. 
This helps us to develop and execute 
the right strategies to ensure that we 
continue to deliver value in a 
sustainable and responsible manner.

PETRONAS Integrated Report 2022
Value We Create
77


The geopolitical conflict in Europe has led to the region 
pivoting away from energy supplied by Russia, which 
previously accounted for about 40 per cent of Europe’s 
natural gas. As a result, energy prices climbed from lows 
seen in the previous two years, prompting players to push 
for higher capacity utilisation to ensure maximum supply 
to meet user demand.
Amid price volatility in both crude oil and natural gas, 
PETRONAS successfully managed challenges by driving 
resilience and operational excellence. Together with 
commercial agility and discipline, we overcame disruptions 
in a more demanding operating environment to deliver a 
strong performance for 2022.
Energy security had become an immediate focus not only 
in Europe but across the world.
Bringing Energy Security to the Fore
For energy players, meeting a surge in demand that came 
amid a re-opening of borders was crucial to ensure 
uninterrupted availability of energy sources to power 
economic recovery. In answering the call for energy 
security, PETRONAS remains steadfast in advancing 
sustainability in our operations and long-term strategy. 
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a vital solution in the 
transition to a net-zero carbon future and we are 
partnering key industry players to deploy CCS while also 
actively reducing methane and flaring.
In 2022, countries participating in the 27th Conference of 
the Parties of the UNFCCC (COP27) in Egypt agreed to 
strengthen and affirm commitments to fight climate 
change despite global headwinds. PETRONAS rose to the 
challenge, granularising our strategy to thrive in energy 
transition and towards realising our Net Zero Carbon 
Emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050) Pathway. Apart from the 
use of CCS, operational excellence is also key to 
achieving this goal, where improved efficiency and fast 
deployment of technology to reduce emissions and lift 
our ability to quickly anticipate and meet market needs.
Gentari, the cleaner energy solutions arm of PETRONAS, 
was launched to accelerate the Group’s push into 
renewable energy, hydrogen and green mobility. These 
will now be part of the portfolio that will catapult 
PETRONAS into playing a leading role in a fast-changing 
energy landscape.
Resilience Through Economic Headwinds
Supply chain disruptions that were still working their way 
through the system meant that costs remained high. In 
the oil and gas sector, cost escalation raised concerns 
that investments today are being channeled to counter 
inflationary pressures when more investments are needed 
to ensure sufficient supply to meet future demand. As an 
energy provider, we will navigate the energy transition in 
a just and responsible manner to deliver energy that 
improves lives and benefits communities across the globe. 
Our strategy towards net zero reflects our drive to 
provide access to cleaner sources of energy, from natural 
gas to hydrogen. We aim to do this through partnerships 
and collaborations that will lift our role in the energy 
sphere.
Across the world, rising inflation has increased pressure 
on central banks to tighten monetary policies, heightening 
concern of a global economic slowdown. The threat of a 
recession appeared just as borders were reopening and 
economic activities were picking up. This added to 
increased volatility in energy markets, which in turn may 
affect investment decisions. Our commitment to ensuring 
energy security remains steadfast and we are committed 
to embedding sustainability in our operations as a 
progressive energy and solutions partner.
Navigating Market Volatility
Oil prices were highly volatile in 2022, marking another 
turbulent year after the pandemic in 2020. After rising 
steadily amid a post-lockdown resurgence in demand, 
crude oil prices spiked to a 14-year high following the 
start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in February. Prices in 
the second half reversed the large gains in the first half of 
2022 as the mounting risk of an imminent slowdown in 
demand gathers over the global economy. This led to 
massive refining capacity closures of around three million 
barrels per day during the pandemic. Meanwhile, the 
Russia-Ukraine conflict had constrained petroleum product 
supply, pushing global refining margins to record levels in 
2022.
Spot LNG prices in Asia hit a record high of USD85/
mmBtu in March 2022 on heightened concern over a 
shortage of supply when Europe scrambled for LNG 
cargoes to make up for Russian piped gas supply. The 
surge in prices resulted in developing nations especially in 
South Asia being starved of affordable fuels while making 
US LNG the biggest winner as Europe sought more 
shipments of the fuel. As energy security concerns 
increased, long-term contracting became favoured again.
The commitment to decarbonise the transport sector intensified further. In the aviation sector, airlines and airports were 
moving towards scaling up sustainable aviation fuel usage, which is mostly bio-based. Governments and sector 
representatives pledged ambitious sustainable aviation fuel blend targets by 2030 to achieve net zero goals by 2050. In 
the shipping sector, countries, ports and shipping companies made more than 40 major announcements on issues such 
as innovations for ships, expansion in low or zero-emission fuels and policies to help promote the uptake of next-
generation zero-emission vessels. The year 2022 kick-started with the ports of Los Angeles and Shanghai announcing 
the world’s first green shipping corridor, followed by five Northern European port authorities’ announcements to serve 
Northern Europe and the Baltic region, as well as the Singapore-Rotterdam route for the longest green shipping 
corridor between Asia and Europe.
Outlook
A prolonged conflict in Europe will lead to continued 
disruptions in oil and gas flows, which means energy 
security remains a key focus for nations. The longer route 
travelled for oil and gas molecules to reach demand 
centres will add to costs and keep energy prices volatile. 
Together with the rising inflation faced by the oil and gas 
sector, this has raised concerns of insufficient spending 
on long-term oil and gas development to meet future 
demand. Global capital expenditure in oil and gas is 
forecasted to rise for a third year in 2023, exceeding 
USD500 billion. This is still some 30 per cent below the 
record USD700 billion that the sector spent in 2014. 
Industry analysts are also concerned that the coming 
year’s capital expenditure (CAPEX) increases will be mostly 
channeled to counter cost inflation and not as much on 
resource finding and development.
Extended Price Volatility
The volatility in the oil market takes place against a 
backdrop of weakening global economic outlook, supply 
disruption from Russia due to European Union sanctions 
and G7 price cap as well as the Organisation of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) alliance output 
cut. OPEC+ aims for market stability and is seen taking 
action to prevent a slowing global economy from sending 
prices down. On the oil refining side, an outlook of an 
economic slowdown, high natural gas prices and a ramp-
up of new greenfield refineries in Asia and the Middle 
East are expected to drag refining margins lower.
Gas and LNG prices may remain above decades-high levels 
for several years as demand for LNG outpaces supply 
growth. The prioritisation of energy security has also 
improved the prospects of low-carbon fuels such as natural 
gas. The leaders of the G7 major economies in June 2022 
conveyed their support for investments in the gas sector 
to reduce dependency on Russian gas while COP27 
supported the development of low-carbon fuels as the 
world seeks to achieve climate goals.
Economic Activities Recover
China’s end to COVID-19 lockdowns is a boost for the 
energy market due to the nation’s ranking as the world’s 
largest oil importer. A recovery in travel and economic 
activities is forecasted to provide support for oil and gas 
prices, even as global GDP slows. Interest rate increases 
are also expected to slow or be paused by central banks 
due to concerns that rate hikes could add to the financial 
turmoil after several bank failures.
Greater Push for Climate Action
While nations and corporations are stepping up to fight 
climate change, the financial sector is also driving action 
through greater scrutiny over investments in energy, 
demanding commitments to decarbonise fossil fuel projects 
and channeling more funds into renewables. Financial 
institutions are looking to strike a balance between 
ensuring sufficient financing for projects that will deliver 
energy security for decades to come and supporting 
renewable energy (RE) developments for clean sources 
of energy. The oil and gas sector is making strides with 
this aim in mind, and in petrochemicals, the evidence is 
seen in the rising number of bio-based projects. Producers 
are pouring funds into research and development 
capabilities and leveraging recycling technologies to lower 
carbon footprints, as well as reduce waste in their push 
towards a circular economy.
Electrification, from the upstream sector to downstream 
petrochemicals, is becoming relevant and prevalent in 
decarbonisation strategies. For hard-to-abate sectors, natural 
gas is a cleaner alternative to provide steam and generate 
the electricity needed. Global leaders are pressuring 
policymakers for more steadfast net-zero policies as current 
climate commitments are insufficient in the fight against 
climate change. Reaching net zero by 2050 requires a 43 
per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 
compared to 2019 levels, despite an International Monetary 
Fund study which estimated that only 11 per cent of the 
emissions will be cut by 2030, based on current commitments.

The World in 2022


At our core, we believe that sustainable business practices demonstrate our commitments to the Company, our 
stakeholders and the planet. By constantly reassessing and revalidating our material topics, we are ensuring that our 
sustainability strategy is informed by the latest data, trends, insights and is responsive to the needs of our stakeholders 
and the environment.
In 2022, we undertook a rigorous reassessment and revalidation of our material topics to ensure that they remain 
relevant and integral to our sustainability strategy and reporting.
Throughout this process, we recognised the significance of the material topics’ impact on our sustainability-related risks 
and opportunities, as well as our impact on society and the planet – a concept known as double materiality. As such, 
we approached our materiality assessment with both an inside-out and outside-in perspective, ensuring that our 
strategy is fully aligned with the needs of our stakeholders and the environment.
To achieve this, we utilised a data-driven tool to conduct an assessment of our material topics, covering both financial 
materiality and impact materiality. This allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the implications of our material 
topics on our business, society and the planet.
As we move forward, we remain committed to improving our double materiality assessment process by embedding 
monitoring and risk elements on a continuous basis. This will ensure that our assessment is sufficiently holistic and 
robust in guiding our company’s sustainability priorities. In addition, we have expanded our horizontal scanning analysis 
to include new sources, allowing us to identify any potential blind spots in our existing topics.

sustainability landscape. SASB proved to be 
especially valuable in preparing for the 
upcoming International Sustainability Standards 
Board (ISSB) standards, given that ISSB has 
committed to building on and embedding the

Stakeholder Engagement
We gained in-depth feedback from external 
stakeholders, including investors, banks and 
rating agencies, to evaluate the material 
topics’ impact on our business. The 
Reputation Strength Index survey, which was 
conducted throughout the year, provided 
valuable insights that helped guide our 
materiality assessment. We documented 
stakeholders’ concerns, queries and 
responses as inputs for the assessment.
Prioritisation
We prioritised our strategies and focus 
areas through initiatives and 
commitments, as well as discussions 
held at the Executive Leadership Team 
and Board level. Our material topics 
were also ranked based on their 
alignment with the risk elements in 
PETRONAS Corporate Risk Profile.
Endorsement
We submitted the results of our 
revalidation process to the 
Sustainability Committee (formerly 
known as Sustainability Council), 
which was then approved by the 
Vice President and Chief 
Sustainability Officer.

2. 
Movement of Material Topics
As we move towards post COVID-19 recovery, we have noticed a shift in priorities for our material topics, with 
Health and Well-being decreasing in importance. However, it remains as a priority as we continue to focus on the 
physical and mental well-being of our employees and surrounding communities.
One of the topics that has gained importance in our materiality assessment is GHG emissions. We have set 
ambitious targets to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and reducing our GHG emissions is a critical 
component of this goal. 
Another topic that has gained significance is lower carbon and energy transition business. We recognise that the 
world is transitioning towards cleaner energy sources and we are committed to playing our part in this transition.
3. 
Double Materiality 
Through our double materiality approach, we consider both the financial and sustainability impact of our material 
topics. This approach allows us to understand the financial implications of sustainability risks and opportunities and 
how they may impact our long-term financial performance.
In our assessments, we found that GHG emissions is the most relevant of all our material topics in both financial 
and sustainability impact perspectives. This highlights the critical role that reducing our carbon footprint plays in 
achieving our sustainability goals and maintaining financial stability. Other material topics that are also significant in 
both perspectives include energy transition business, climate change risks and management and safety 
management.
4. 
Areas for Improvement
By including new sources in our identification process, we noticed additional areas which were not covered in our 
existing material topics. However, these were topics that are already embedded in our enterprise risk management 
and portfolio management, including but not limited to business resilience and continuity in the face of potential 
catastrophic events; energy security and affordability; cybersecurity and information security; corporate’s core 
values and guiding principles; and shifting demographics. As part of continuous improvement, we have included 
these as points of consideration, as we continue to explore better ways of integrating ESG factors into PETRONAS’ 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process directly.

Environmental Management
An inability to conserve and protect nature and biodiversity may impact our ability to deliver on our business goals and NZCE 
2050 Pathway. As climate change is significantly driving biodiversity loss and may cause irreversible damage, we aim to further 
understand our relationship and dependency on nature in order to improve oversight of our nature and biodiversity footprint.
Protecting and conserving the environment will minimise the impact of our operations on the environment, given our role as an 
environmental steward. This will also ensure the long-term health of our business and the communities around us. We identify 
and assess the environmental impact of our operations and focus on managing our resources sustainably. This includes, but is 
not limited to, decreasing the impact of emissions, creating responsible waste and water management strategies, preventing spills 
and decommissioning our assets in a safe and sustainable manner.
Safety Management
Managing the safety of our people continues to remain a top priority as this ensures we protect our employees and contractors 
from any harm or injuries. In striving towards operational excellence, we conduct proactive risk management practices across our 
business and operations to provide the safest possible work conditions while ensuring our assets are continuously well 
maintained. 
Climate Change Risks
Our aim is to strengthen PETRONAS’ resilience to physical and transition climate change risks, while seizing the opportunities 
presented in the transition to a lower-carbon economy. We are actively looking into adaptation and resilience measures, as well 
as the relevant governance systems to manage climate-related risks and opportunities, as per the recommendations of the Task 
Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions
Our approach to realising our NZCE 2050 Pathway is guided by our four main decarbonisation levers – zero routine flaring and 
venting, energy efficiency, electrification and carbon capture and storage. Additionally, we are continuously improving 
measurement quantification to mitigate methane emissions from our operations to limit the impact of GHG emissions over a 
more immediate period. We also pursue collaborative initiatives with industry peers. We are focusing on gaining a clearer 
understanding of energy consumption within the Company and throughout our value chain to support our emissions mitigation 
efforts.

Effective risk management is fundamental to our value creation, especially given the dynamic and volatile landscape 
following post-pandemic recovery and heightened geopolitical uncertainties in 2022. As we accelerate our progress in 
energy transition, we are expanding our stepping-out beyond current core business and commitments to develop new 
business and realise our NZCE 2050 Pathway. We pushed ahead to continuously identify, assess and manage our risks 
and opportunities to create value while delivering positive outcomes. We strengthened our risk management and 
internal control system to build resilience, enhance our ability to meet stakeholder demands and deliver our long-term 
strategic goals.
Preserving Value Through Effective Risk Management
To create sustainable value, we implement a comprehensive risk management and internal control system that mitigates 
significant risks. This system is fundamental to delivering long-term stakeholder value as it identifies, assesses, manages 
and monitors a range of financial and non-financial risks. It is not intended to eliminate risk entirely, but instead to 
manage our risk exposure across our businesses, while at the same time making the most of any opportunities. This 
system provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Setting the tone from the top and driving our risk management and internal control system is the PETRONAS Board 
(Board) and its sub-committees, namely the Risk Committee (RC) and Audit Committee (AC), as well as the Executive 
Leadership Team (ELT). In addition to the above committees, the Risk Management Committee (RMC) and respective 
Risk Management functions support the risk oversight.
Risk Management Committee (RMC)
RMC serves as a central platform to support 
PETRONAS’ Management and the Board in managing 
risks and maintaining acceptable levels of risks as well 
as providing guidance and advisory on Groupwide risk 
management system and its implementation.

PETRONAS Risk Policy outlines the general principles and guidelines for making risk-based decisions. Through this 
policy, we continuously strive to implement risk management best practices to protect and create value. It ensures a 
balanced and holistic view of exposures to achieve business objectives, thus strengthening our position as a risk-
resilient organisation. Complementing this policy is the PETRONAS Resiliency Model, which provides an integrated and 
holistic view of the overall strategy for more effective risk management. It focuses on three areas of business resilience, 
namely Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), Crisis Management (CM) and Business Continuity Management (BCM).

Risks Linked to Creating Value
PETRONAS Board

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is integral to managing the business. It acts as a guide to systematically 
identify, assess, treat, monitor and review risks, as outlined in our ERM process. It aims to improve our ability to 
reduce the likelihood and/or impact of risks that may affect the achievement of our business objectives.
Through the ERM process, risk profiles are established, together with the corresponding risk mitigations and key risk 
indicators, all of which are monitored at the corporate level and by the respective units across PETRONAS Group.
PETRONAS Risk Appetite articulates the type of risks we are willing to accept to guide strategic decisions at the 
corporate level. It reflects our position, propensity and acceptability to take risks in various areas, namely strategic, 
financial, operational and reputational while adhering to legal and regulatory compliance. The risk appetite for each 
area is determined by its respective tolerance and threshold levels.
At the corporate level, the PETRONAS Corporate Risk Profile and Risk Appetite are monitored and reported 
quarterly to the RMC, ELT, RC and the Board. 
Risk assessments are conducted at key decision points to:
• Ensure decisions that significantly impact our business operations and strategies are made through consideration 
of risk-reward trade-off; and 
• Create risk-reward conversations at respective decision platforms and/or approving authority.
Crisis Management (CM) is an integrated process that aims to prepare our domestic and international operations 
to respond to and manage crises in risk areas, to protect the People, Environment, Assets and Reputation (PEAR). 
Under CM, we adopt a three-tiered response protocol that demarcates the roles and responsibilities of the emergency 
site management, operating unit management, corporate and internal or external response agencies and/or authorities. 
We also conduct Testing and Exercising (T&E) via simulation of test scenarios to ensure the effectiveness of response 
strategies and promote continuous improvement, as identified in the Emergency or Crisis Management Plan.
Business Continuity Management (BCM) aims to build our capabilities to recover and continuously deliver 
products or services at acceptable, predefined levels following any prolonged disruption. The Business Continuity 
Plan (BCP) is key to this framework, which enhances our preparedness to recover and restore business-critical 
functions within a reasonable period, sustain activities and minimise disruptions to stakeholders. Through 
simulation of test scenarios, we also conduct T&E to validate the effectiveness of recovery strategies as well as 
maintain a high level of competence and readiness as identified in the BCP.

Managing Our Principal Risks 
Our ability to create long-term value is subject to several factors, including those beyond our control. Whether known 
or unknown, these and other risks may present threats that could adversely impact our operations and our 
stakeholders. Nevertheless, they may also present opportunities that can be leveraged for strategic benefit to pursue 
growth opportunities and build the right capabilities for business sustainability. The principal risks are set out below 
together with the key mitigation measures to manage them. This list is not exhaustive and the order in which we 
outline these risks does not necessarily reflect the likelihood of occurrence or magnitude of their impact.
In 2022, Sustainability Risk is included as one of the principal risks to reflect the significance of managing 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) related exposures including climate change risk to the business strategies 
for long term growth. Given the exposures climate change risk present to PETRONAS’ business operations and 
strategies, it has been considered as input to some of the principal risks.
In addition, the Risk Management in Action section features our focused efforts in effectively managing selected 
principal risks against the backdrop of a dynamic and uncertain operating environment. 
We are strengthening our risk management efforts and related disclosures to ensure consistency with global 
sustainability frameworks and standards. Aligning our disclosures with the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) is in progress and can be accessed in the Safeguard the Environment section. Work is also ongoing 
to ensure alignment of our disclosure with the World Economic Forum’s Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics.

Risks Linked to Creating Value


Impact on Value
Impact on Value
• The geopolitical situation, particularly the Russia-Ukraine war and the prolonged impact of COVID-19 have influenced the fluctuation of 
commodity prices and customers’ demand leading to implications on areas such as our project viability, financial performance and 
returns to shareholders.
• It also impacts the ability of our counterparties such as vendors, partners and contractors to fulfil their contractual obligations to the 
Group as commercial arrangements are pegged to commodity prices. Consequently, this could impede our growth prospects and have a 
long-term impact on the sustainability of our business operations.
• Meanwhile, changes in customer preferences brought about by the energy transition result in increased competition in the energy 
industry, indirectly affecting our value chain.
• Fluctuations in exchange rate stemming from our global operations and the difference between reporting currency in Ringgit Malaysia 
and transactions that are dealt in US Dollar may lead to increased cost of operations and revenue erosion.
Impact on Capitals
Impact on Capitals
Financial Capital: 
External uncertainties resulting from changes in market conditions can undermine our capacity to realise consistent returns and may impact 
the Group’s capability to sustain business operations and pursue growth.
Manufactured Capital: 
Identifying assets that form the core engine to support current and future operating models may also be at risk of changing market 
demands and external regulations.
Intellectual and Human Capitals:
Existing intellectual capital required to support the business can be made redundant in the face of rapid changes in technology and the 
market environment.
Natural Capital: 
Prospective oil and gas investments and efforts to prolong existing assets and economic life of reserves may become uneconomical should 
there be changes in the market environment and outlook.
Market Risk
What It Means
The Group’s financial performance is exposed to risks caused by the volatility of commodity prices, changes in customer demand and 
fluctuation of the exchange rate, influenced by factors such as macroeconomy, geopolitics, supply demand balance as well as the 
lingering effects of COVID-19. 
Additionally, the energy transition driven by climate change will impact customers’ preferences as demand for renewable energy and 
more sustainably sourced products gain prominence, thus, increasing pressure on us to diversify into new areas beyond our core 
business.

Mitigation Strategies
Mitigation Strategies
1. Undertake regular reviews of strategies, prioritise resources to 
areas of the highest importance for the organisation and 
conduct rigorous efforts to secure new demand within the core 
and new business in response to the wide-ranging market risks 
and the corresponding challenges in generating value from our 
business.
2. Undertake regular monitoring and review of our portfolio 
composition and counterparty performance to identify critical 
issues and specific interventions to limit the exposure to 
PETRONAS, for example securing new demand aligned to the 
strategic thrusts, business diversification requirements and 
identified building blocks to realise NZCE 2050 targets.
3. Manage market risk exposures namely commodity price and 
foreign exchange exposure through hedging activities to protect 
value and margins.
4. Implement prudent financial governance through PETRONAS 
Financial Policy (PFP), supported by the PETRONAS Financial 
Standards (PFS) which outlines the principles and requirements 
that promote effective implementation of financial management 
including financial risk management practices to ensure financial 
resilience over the long term. PETRONAS Financial Risk Appetite 
was implemented across the Group with specific financial 
thresholds to ensure that business decisions are undertaken 
within the approved thresholds.
5. Ensure continuous engagements with targeted stakeholders to 
advocate our business strategies and instil awareness, ensure 
buy-ins and obtain support from the relevant stakeholders.
Risk Movement
Risk Movement
Concerns regarding the supply security following the Russia-Ukraine war underpins the global oil price volatility, adding further pressure to 
an already tightening crude market with OPEC+ producing lower than planned. Upward price momentum is also partially tempered by 
China’s continued Zero-COVID policy, global recession fears and strong US dollar. These concerns led to increased exposures on market 
risk and are managed through the approved mechanism and risk appetite.
Opportunities
Opportunities
1. Defined strategic direction coupled with price volatility and changes in customer demand have steered PETRONAS to accelerate 
diversification of our energy mix to timely capture new market opportunities, including establishment of Gentari as our clean energy 
solutions entity.
2.  The uncertain geopolitical situation provides opportunities to enter new markets, explore new supply bases and establish new 
partnerships across the supply chain.
3. The volatile commodity market provides opportunities for PETRONAS to actively pursue trading opportunities and provide additional 
value by capturing pockets of favorable volatility. Furthermore, heightened ESG awareness provides an opportunity for the inclusion of 
ESG-linked products in hedging and trading activities in line with the Global Energy Market’s trajectory towards sustainability.
4. Accelerating the utilisation of digital tools and technology, enhancing trading and supply chain models, as well as pursuing cost 
management tools enable us to counter the short term impact of volatility.

• 
Deterioration in liquidity position impacts affordability and capital availability, thus limiting future growth. This may lead to an inability to 
meet shareholders’ requirements in a timely and sustainable manner.
• 
Downgrade of our credit rating and non-compliance to ESG and climate change requirements could lead to higher borrowing costs and 
limited capacity to access the capital market. 
• 
High CAPEX concentration in energy transition and decarbonisation efforts may impact our revenue stream due to delays in return 
realisation, ability to attain the right talent and timely deployment of technology.
Mitigation Strategies
Mitigation Strategies
1. Establish the Asset Liability and Liquidity Management Committee 
(ALCO) as the oversight body to oversee, deliberate, review and 
monitor asset and liability management strategies in managing 
foreign exchange, interest rate and liquidity risks. This includes 
overall liquidity management strategies to achieve financial 
objectives and support the Group’s business growth. Review and 
monitor our liquidity position regularly aligned to the risk appetite 
established for liquidity and indebtedness levels.
2. Execute the following to manage Liquidity Risk, similar to 
managing Market Risk:
• 
The PFP and PFS guide us to ensure that adequate financial 
management and risk management practices are 
implemented.
• 
The Portfolio Commodity Hedging Programme protects value 
and margin against adverse price movement.
3. Establish a Liquidity Risk Contingency Protocol (LRCP) which will 
act as a liquidity crisis management plan to ensure PETRONAS’ 
responsiveness in safeguarding the Group’s financial 
sustainability. 
4. Establish a trust fund (Decarbonisation Fund) and continuous 
contribution to safeguard the availability of funds for its intended 
utilisation for decarbonisation and clean energy in achieving NZCE 
2050 targets.

Risk Management in Action 
PETRONAS’ Post-Pandemic Recovery Efforts
Globally, 2022 saw a period of continued recovery from the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Combined with 
geopolitical uncertainties, global demand and supply were negatively impacted leading to a high-cost and high-price 
environment. A shortage of raw materials and services as well as increased demand consequently led to competition for 
these limited resources. 
From a human capital perspective, the global workforce evolved rapidly post-pandemic and demand for flexibility in the 
work environment was heightened. The pandemic disrupted the organisation’s usual way of working and accelerated 
ongoing evolutions such as telework and digitalisation.
As part of our post-pandemic recovery efforts, we focused on managing the implications of supply chain disruptions 
and facilitating our workforce to adapt to the new way of working.
1. Managing global supply chain disruptions
The oil and gas industry faced a limited supply of key resources leading to competition for resources such as marine 
vessels, fabrication yards, drilling rigs and skilled talents. Combined with the scarcity of vendors in the market as well 
as financial challenges faced by some vendors, these factors may adversely impact the pace and cost of project 
delivery for PETRONAS.
In managing the associated implications, we closely monitored the progress of project delivery to enable relevant 
intervention on project cost and schedule to be undertaken in a timely manner, while ensuring project compliance 
with internal standards and requirements in delivering project quality. These efforts culminated in projects delivered 
according to On Time, On Budget, On Scope (OTOBOS) while some were completed ahead of schedule, ultimately 
delivering value to PETRONAS through cost reduction, operational efficiency and cash generation. 
In addition, targeted efforts to strengthen supply chain resiliency, focusing on vendor and contract management have 
been implemented. These efforts include establishing strategic collaborations with government bodies and other industry 
players in shaping the Oil and Gas Services and Equipment (OGSE) industry. We extended support to vendors by 
enhancing capacity and capability development as well as facilitating access to financing from Malaysian financial 
institutions. We also identified alternative reliable supply points to diversify access to key materials and services. Lastly, we 
also developed innovative contracting strategies to enhance contract efficiency and promote a competitive market.
2. Adapting to a new way of working
The pandemic has challenged and transformed the idea of a conventional workplace and hybrid working has become the 
new norm. While we continued to deliver business targets and preserved operational efficiency during these extraordinary 
circumstances, some employees have struggled to adapt, leading to a deterioration in employees’ mental well-being.
In addressing this, key initiatives were introduced, such as the Flexible Working Arrangement (FlexiWork) to support 
work-life balance for employees to manage their professional and personal commitments, empowering them to 
achieve productivity and continue delivering for the organisation. 
We also strengthened the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) 2.0 by extending its benefits to employees’ direct 
family members as a proactive measure to address mental health concerns among our employees, as we recognise 
family members as their strongest support system. 
The pandemic has also accelerated the adoption of digital technologies and PETRONAS has adapted. The increased 
reliance on digital technologies as part of the new way of working has expanded the digital footprint. This expansion, 
coupled with the evolution of digital threats has increased our exposure to cyberattacks.
In response, we focused on establishing specific key cybersecurity capabilities to ensure employees can work safely 
and securely, regardless of location or device they are working from. 
On top of the requisite security governance, infrastructure, processes and cyber defensive capability, we ramped up 
efforts to strengthen security of Internet access and device, with around-the-clock support from the Security 
Operations Centre. We increased communication and awareness activities around behaviours of working remotely in a 
secure manner, keeping staff updated with the latest threats. These efforts were key in supporting both organisational 
and employee resilience in the face of new emerging threats, resulting from technological and digital shifts across the 
business and in adapting to the hybrid working arrangement as a new norm.

PETRONAS Energy Transition Strategy
Energy transition is happening and is gaining momentum.
The energy transition journey is not linear given many moving parts – evolving policies 
and regulations, changing customer preferences for low-carbon energy solutions and 
increasing expectations of investors and financiers.
PETRONAS as a leading global energy company aims to play a key role in the energy 
transition, focusing on energy security and at the same time delivering energy solutions 
responsibly.
We have developed our Energy Transition Strategy centred on creating value for our 
customers and stakeholders. Our Energy Transition Strategy will steer PETRONAS to 
strengthen our Core Business, capture new growth opportunities for New Business and at 
the same time responsibly manage carbon emissions to realise our NZCE 2050 Pathway.
Our priority is to strike the right balance between growth in our Core Business and New 
Business while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in order to thrive in the energy 
transition. We will allocate our capital resources with discipline and nurture a strong 
talent bench to deliver this strategy.
We will remain resolutely progressive to ensure a sustainable future.
The world needs more energy to support a growing 
population and economic expansion, but this demand must be 
met with reduced emissions for a sustainable future.
Oil and gas will continue to be relevant in the energy mix until 
2050, with gas playing a major role as a transition fuel, given 
growing demand for gas to fulfil global energy security needs.
PETRONAS is in an advantageous position in this energy 
transition as two-thirds of its hydrocarbon portfolio is made 
up of gas. PETRONAS will continue to serve global LNG 
demand as one of the leading LNG players in the world.
PETRONAS’ efforts to strengthen its Core Business will help 
sustain the vibrancy of the oil and gas integrated value chain, 
local Oil and Gas Services and Equipment (OGSE) ecosystem 
and adjacent industries.

Upstream
Datuk Adif Zulkifli
Executive Vice President and Chief 
Executive Officer, Upstream
In 2022, the world leaned on oil and gas to meet its energy needs in 
light of the geopolitical turmoil. This led to record high energy prices 
and an uptick in upstream activities against the backdrop of increased 
costs. And the industry responded, delivering the energy security needed 
in a sustainable manner.
A renewed focus on the home front rendered a string of successful 
exploration discoveries which grew Malaysia’s resource base. We also 
sanctioned a slew of projects and activities to continue safeguarding the 
country’s energy security and guaranteeing the vibrancy of its oil and gas 
industry. Internationally, the reshaping of our portfolio is ongoing 
through growth in some of the world’s most prolific basins. We also 
undertook a series of high-grading efforts, driven by a relentless focus 
on value and delivering differentiated barrels.
Finally, we made great strides in decarbonisation and carbon capture and 
storage (CCS); sanctioning our flagship CCS project while maturing more 
projects in the pipeline. On the service front, we forged partnerships 
with leading industry players and customers across the value chain, in 
positioning Malaysia as a regional CCS hub.
Upstream will continue to balance our responsibility while transforming 
into a low-cost and low-carbon business through strategic and decisive 
measures, including an enhanced focus on HSE and integrity, which we 
consider key pillars for success.

(a) Gas conversion factor prior to ARPR 1.1.2022 6,000 scf = 1 boe. ARPR 1.1.2022 and beyond 5,650 scf = 1 boe.
(b) For ARPR 1.1.2022, without the uplift due to the change in conversion factor, the 3-year average 1P RRR ratio would be 1.6.
As at 1 January 2023, PETRONAS’ total petroleum 2P reserves stood at 9.25 Bboe, an increase of two per cent 
from 2021. The improvement in reserves performance is primarily due to the healthy maturation of contingent 
resources to reserves. PETRONAS' total contingent resources (2C) stood at 15.50 Bboe, an increase of one per 
cent from 2021 as a result of nine new exploration discoveries that were made during the year that contributed 
0.77 Bboe of 2C to our portfolio.

We have a deep-rooted commitment to sustainability as it is an essential part of our business. We firmly believe in 
responsible practices that create positive impacts on societies and economies. According to the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), the global community must urgently reduce total 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 43 per cent by 2030 to mitigate the worst effects of climate change and secure a 
better future for all. In 2012, we introduced the PETRONAS Carbon Commitments and over the past decade, we have 
been working tirelessly to reduce our emissions. As Malaysia’s custodian of hydrocarbon resources, we remain steadfast 
in supporting Malaysia’s long-term aspirations and Nationally Determined Contribution to the Paris Agreement.

Memberships and Associations
As we move forward in supporting the global agenda, we believe that building relationships through trust and 
respect is crucial. We continuously explore and actively participate in professional associations, events, and 
memberships to strengthen our sustainability efforts, aligned with our strategic direction and Net Zero Carbon 
Emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050) Pathway. Through our participation and engagements, we are able to better 
understand the concerns that need to be addressed and identify ways in which we could do to help. Our aim is 
to contribute to the nation-building of Malaysia and create a positive impact across industries and society.
In 2022, we further demonstrated our commitment to the industry through three additional involvements. We 
became a member of the Energy Transitions Commission where we aim to strengthen our leadership role in 
championing the energy transition agenda in Malaysia as well as in the ASEAN region.
We also affirmed our methane commitments by joining United Nation’s Environment Programmme (UNEP) Oil and 
Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP2.0) Framework. It is a comprehensive, measurement-based reporting 
framework that improves the accuracy and transparency of methane emissions reporting in the energy sector.
We also joined the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)’s Alliance for Industry Decarbonisation 
alongside other global companies across industrial sectors. The Alliance aims to contribute to the achievement of 
country-specific net-zero goals, foster action for decarbonisation of industrial value chains and enhance 
understanding of renewables-based solutions and their adoption by industry.

Sustainability Statement


Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions
Why Is It Important? 
Climate science plays a significant role in driving the 
transition to renewable energy sources and low-carbon 
technologies. As awareness of the need to mitigate 
climate change grows, there is increasing demand for 
cleaner, sustainable energy. This shift creates both risks 
and opportunities for PETRONAS.
We risk being left behind as the world transitions to a 
low-carbon economy, leading to stranded assets, lost 
revenue streams and reputational damage. However, we 
see opportunity to lead in the energy transition, leveraging 
our legacy, expertise and resources to develop greener 
technologies and business models.
What Is Our Approach?
PETRONAS is dedicated to our role as custodian of 
Malaysia’s hydrocarbon resources and to meet customer 
energy demands, while contributing towards the climate 
ambitions of the Paris Agreement. Our NZCE 2050 
Pathway was launched in November 2022, outlining the 
actions needed to achieve our net-zero ambitions. The 
development of the NZCE 2050 Pathway was informed by 
our business context, national policies, international 
frameworks, and scientific consensus on climate change.
In driving a focused delivery of the NZCE 2050 Pathway, 
20 per cent of total capital expenditure will be allocated 
for decarbonisation projects and expansion into cleaner 
energy solutions from 2022 to 2026. We will also track 
our GHG emissions to ensure we are on the right 
trajectory to meet the targets.
We aspire to proactively strengthen transparency in 
reporting while shaping the national climate-related risk 
disclosure practice in Malaysia. We have commenced to 
apply the framework recommendations put forward by the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
to our assessment of climate risk. By aligning our strategic 
assessment of risk with TCFD, we strive to effectively 
manage and capitalise on climate-related risks and 
opportunities and accelerate progress towards our path to 
net zero.
Safeguard the 
Environment
We continue to accelerate our climate actions to 
realise our Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 
(NZCE 2050) Pathway. Throughout 2022, we ramped-
up our efforts to advance our performance. With a 
resolute focus on driving progress, we will continue 
bridging the emissions gap and work with 
stakeholders to embrace the changes on the path to 
net zero.
Aligned to:
1 
Governance 
We recognise that climate change is a critical business issue, contributing to a set of risks and opportunities. We are 
taking more deliberate actions to elevate sustainability, especially climate-related discussions at the Board, to shape the 
long-term strategic direction of the company.
[The role of the Board in climate-related matters can be referred to in the Sustainability Statement section on page 155]
2 
Addressing Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities 
In November 2022, we defined our NZCE 2050 to accelerate and advance groupwide actions and commitment. The 
NZCE 2050 Pathway – with its short-, medium- and long term targets – will steer the group towards realising our 
ambitions.
The Pathway is two-pronged, reducing operational GHG emissions and increasing investments in business growth 
opportunities in the low carbon economy. PETRONAS will implement activities through four main decarbonisation levers 
– zero routine flaring and venting, energy efficiency, electrification and carbon capture and storage (CCS) – to reduce 
operational emissions as far as possible and offset remaining hard-to-abate emissions with nature-based climate 
solutions.

Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities
Risk management accountability and oversight is an 
integral part of our governance including Climate Change 
governance. The Board reviews and considers our 
principal risks in the PETRONAS Corporate Risk Profile, 
covering operational and strategic risks based on periodic 
updates. The updates include an overview of the principal 
risks, a summary of material changes, as well as updates 
on mitigations and performance against key indicators. 
The Risk Management Committee, Executive Leadership 
Team (ELT) and Risk Committee assist the Board with the 
oversight of risk management including environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) and climate-related risk 
management.
 
[Further details on risk governance can be referred to in the Risks 
Linked to Creating Values section on page 86]
We apply a groupwide approach to the management of 
risk through the establishment of the PETRONAS Risk 
Policy and complemented by the PETRONAS Resiliency 
Model, which the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
Framework is part of. These policies and frameworks 
provide an integrated and holistic view of the overall 
strategy towards effective risk management.
[Details of PETRONAS Resiliency Model can be referred to in the Risks 
Linked to Creating Value section on page 87]
 
Our ERM includes requirements and guidance on the tools 
and processes involved to systematically identify, assess, 
evaluate, manage, report and monitor all types of risks. 
The ERM process requires a thorough assessment of 
entities and functional risks, including climate-related risks. 
It also includes an impact and likelihood assessment, 
which supports consideration of the relative significance of 
risks. Principal risks are identified and approved by 
management as pertinent risks to the entity and requires 
close monitoring.

Recognising the exposure of climate-related risks to our 
business operations and strategies, the impact of climate 
change has been taken into consideration and reflected in 
the development of relevant principal risks such as 
Sustainability Risks, Financial Liquidity Risk, Market Risk and 
Legal and Regulatory Risks. We are also strengthening our 
climate-related risk management efforts and corresponding 
disclosures to ensure they align with global sustainability 
frameworks and standards. Our efforts are positioned to 
align with the TCFD recommendations and the World 
Economic Forum’s Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics.
 
We have been actively addressing climate change for 
almost a decade with our Climate Change Position and 
Framework which is the impetus of our climate change 
risk assessments that have been conducted since 2015. 
However, increasing stakeholders’ expectations towards 
energy companies to align the climate risk assessment 
with global sustainability standards and frameworks has led 
us to progressively review and enhance our climate-
related risk assessment approach.
We have adopted TCFD’s categorisation of climate-related 
risks into two major categories which are transition risks 
and physical risks.

Transition Risks
Transition risks refer to potential risks arising from the 
global shift towards a more sustainable, net-zero 
economy, which encompasses policy, regulatory, market 
and technological changes that could impact our business 
operations.
One of the transition risks identified is the impact of oil 
and gas pricing or margins, which may reduce commercial
returns stemming from the change in consumer 
preferences, regulatory pressure and/or our approach to
sustainability. This in turn may result in diminished 
revenue, cash generation and returns realisation.
 
International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios provide oil and 
gas prices, which are built on underlying assumptions of 
socio-economic growth and climate policies and 
commitments’ development. For instance, oil prices are 
expected to be the lowest in the Net Zero Emissions by 
2050 Scenario (NZE), due to reduced demand for oil. This 
would have a material impact on our upstream business. 
We also recognise carbon pricing as a means of driving 
emissions reduction across economic activities. Carbon 
pricing is used to assess our potential cost impact based 
on the different climate scenarios. 
Furthermore, the energy transition calls for better 
disclosures and enhanced transparency given the impact 
of significant climate-related issues or risks to our 
financials. Our inability to respond at pace will lead to 
reduced access to capital, inflated capital cost and limited 
investment types. In addition, a downgrade of our ESG 
score may lead to higher borrowing costs, which further 
limits capacity to access capital markets.
Strategic measures to manage the implication of transition 
risks to our organisation are highlighted in the Our 
Approach to Climate-related Risks and Opportunities 
section. These measures are aligned with the mitigations 
and Key Risks Indicators of the identified principal risks in 
the PETRONAS Corporate Risk Profile, which are 
Sustainability Risk, Financial Liquidity Risk, Market Risk, and 
Legal and Regulatory Risk in the Risks Linked to Creating 
Value section.
[Further information on actions to address climate-change-related 
risks by our businesses can be referred to in the Business Review 
section]
Risks and Opportunities Quantification on Financial Performance
We have identified certain risks and opportunities to our business based on the three International Energy Agency (IEA) 
scenarios – Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), and Net Zero Emissions by 2050 
Scenario (NZE). The scenarios were chosen based on their breadth that consider the world’s different states based on 
energy makeup and carbon dioxide emission levels. They present three climate pathways, with temperature rise ranging 
from below 2°C to 2.7°C by 2100, providing granular and regional data breakdown. 
The time horizons used were short term (2024), medium term (2030) and long term (2050). Identified risks relate to 
how oil, gas and carbon prices will impact PETRONAS Group EBITDA*, based on analysis for Upstream, Gas and 
Downstream businesses for FY2030. We have identified opportunities in renewable energy, hydrogen and green mobility 
based on their impact on our EBITDA for the New Energy business for FY2030. The chosen scenarios and the 
corresponding climate outcomes are summarised as below:

weakening – of future policy action, 
except where there already is 
specific evidence to the contrary.

Physical Risks
Physical risks resulting from climate change can be in the 
form of acute risks due to one-time events or chronic 
risks due to longer-term changes in climate patterns such 
as rise in sea levels and average global temperature, water 
shortages, and intense precipitation. Our physical assets 
and ongoing projects are exposed to physical risks as we 
have presence in more than 30 countries globally. Thus, 
we are not and will not be spared from the direct and 
indirect damages brought about by the impact of physical 
climate-related risks.
While actions are ongoing to manage physical risks, we 
continuously re-assess implications, taking into 
consideration the changing outlook for geographical 
locations where we are present. The re-assessment 
outcome serves as an imperative to strengthen our 
existing mitigation strategy in ensuring robustness and 
sustainability of our organisation moving forward.
Taking into account these factors, we will continue to 
pursue a deliberate energy transition strategy, balancing 
Core Business and New Business with our NZCE 2050 
Pathway aligning with changing customer preferences, 
evolving regulations and increasing expectations by 
stakeholders for low-carbon energy solutions.

Metrics and Targets
We have revised our carbon emissions accounting method to adhere to international frameworks and sector specific 
guidance to give us a robust basis for Scope 1 and Scope 2, and a better understanding of Scope 3 GHG emissions. 
The financial year 2022 marks the beginning of disclosures of GHG emissions through both operational control and 
equity share approaches. 
In charting our NZCE 2050 Pathway, PETRONAS has adopted the equity share approach to account for our emissions 
inventory and performance against mid- and long-term milestone targets, with 2019 as the base year.
Our 2024 short-term GHG emissions target and all methane emissions reduction targets are based on the operational 
control approach. This allows us to track performance of all assets under our control and to drive immediate climate 
actions for direct and effective change.
The equity share approach will guide our assets and investments to be in line with our Pathway and be reflected in our 
annual integrated report. This methodology allows for business’ long-term energy transition pathway development and 
portfolio transition tracking.
As a result of our enhanced emissions accounting practices, which includes a change in organisational boundary, we 
have adjusted our 2019 baseline reference to 54.87 Million tCO2e via equity share approach.
The Pathway has short-term and mid-term targets focusing on absolute GHG and methane emissions. The short-term 
target is to cap Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to 49.5 Million tCO2e by 2024 for PETRONAS operated assets in 
Malaysia.
We have set a mid-term target to reduce 25 per cent GHG emissions for Scope 1 and Scope 2 under equity share 
approach by the year 2030.
A key area of our net-zero efforts is to reduce methane emissions. Methane is a primary component of natural gas and 
a more potent GHG than carbon dioxide. Thus, we have specified targets for methane emissions reduction as part of 
our broader GHG targets.
The target is to reduce methane emission groupwide by 50 per cent by 2025 and by 70 per cent by 2030. Additionally, 
we are committed to drive down methane emissions beyond PETRONAS’ own operations within our industry. To this 
aim, we have established a 50 per cent methane emissions reduction target for Malaysia’s natural gas value chain by 
2030. The methane emissions reduction targets will support Malaysia’s commitment to the Global Methane Pledge of 
reducing national methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030.
Moving forward, PETRONAS is updating internal standards and procedures, and building capabilities in GHG and 
methane emissions management. Commencing in 2023, PETRONAS will commission third party assurance of Scope 1 
and Scope 2 GHG emissions.

2022 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Management
As part of the embedment process and to ensure 
sustainable GHG management practice across PETRONAS 
operations, several initiatives were undertaken during 2022:
1 
Enhancement of GHG Management System
Following the mainstreaming of GHG Management as part 
of PETRONAS HSE Mandatory Control Framework (MCF) in 
January 2022, PETRONAS has conducted four internal 
assurance activities – second line assurance and internal 
reviews – based on a risk-based approach. This activity 
helped to identify key gaps and enablers to improve GHG 
accounting and reporting.
2 
GHG Digital Tools
PETRONAS has improved and automated the quantification 
of Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions in Gas business 
by linking activity data from plant information systems to 
the calculation tool, eliminating the need for human 
intervention in the process.
3 
GHG Capability
PETRONAS has identified GHG Management as a crucial 
skill set to be developed as an enabler to realise our 
NZCE 2050 Pathway. A new discipline has been 
established under the HSE skill group with a set of 
competency requirements, recommended trainings and 
required resources across corporate and business 
functions.
4 
Physical Impacts of Climate Change
A vulnerability assessment was conducted on PETRONAS’ 
assets covering 1,140 locations in Upstream, Gas and 
Downstream in Malaysia as part of Malaysia’s Fourth National 
Communication Report (NC4) to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 
Through this assessment populated in a Geographic 
Information System (GIS) system, climate hazards data such 
as sea level rise, coastal floods, river floods, droughts and 
temperature rise were gathered and forecasted up to year 
2100 for Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak. This 
initiative has created value by identifying high risk assets and 
serves as an input to our adaptation strategy.
PETRONAS also has completed vulnerability assessments in 
South Africa for Downstream refinery and retail operations. 
Key climate hazards are floods and storms. A training and 
upskilling session was conducted for Engen staff to enable 
them to develop and maintain an adaptation plan.
Accelerating Methane Emissions Management in 
PETRONAS
We align our methane emissions management with the 
Methane Guiding Principles (MGP) that prioritise key actions 
along the natural gas supply chain.
As a signatory member of the Methane Guiding Principles, 
we commit to advancing robust performance across gas 
value chains, enhancing the accuracy and quality of methane 
emissions data, advocating best practices, sound policies, 
and regulations on methane emissions, capability building 
and increasing the transparency of methane emissions to 
better manage them.
In 2022, PETRONAS became a member of the United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP) Oil and Gas Methane 
Partnership 2.0 (OGMP2.0) Reporting Framework, a multi-
stakeholder initiative established by UNEP and the Climate 
and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC). OGMP2.0 provides a 
comprehensive, measurement-based reporting framework 
that improves the accuracy and transparency of methane 
emissions reporting in the energy sector.
1 
Advancing Techniques for Methane Measurement 
Acknowledging the importance of reporting accurate 
methane emissions to facilitate effective reduction, 
PETRONAS is improving our quantification beyond the 
main emissions sources of flaring, venting and 
combustion. Rigorous efforts were made throughout 2022 
to improve methane data accuracy for PETRONAS’ natural 
gas value chain covering 11 common sources below:
Intended Releases:
Well Completion/
Testing
Fugitive Emissions
Venting of 
Hydrocarbon
Flaring of
Hydrocarbon
Stationary
Combustion
Compressor
Seals
Pneumatic
Devices
Gas Dehydration
Hydrocarbon Storage 
Tanks
Liquids Unloading
Loss of Primary 
Containment (Tier 3)
Unintended Releases:
Safeguard the Environment
Methane quantification was based on best available 
operational data guided by internal and international 
standards from Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 
(OGMP2.0) and Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI). 
Additionally, PETRONAS’ Group Technical Solutions 
department have developed a quantification tool using 
location specific operational data and emission factors 
from the American Petroleum Institute (API) Compendium 
to perform the detailed quantification of methane 
emissions covering 11 common methane emissions 
sources.
Major methane sources i.e., flaring and venting, were 
measured using direct measurements (flowmeters) or 
quantified using detailed engineering calculations based on 
specific process parameters. For the remaining methane 
sources, improvements were made to the quantification by 
inventorying the equipment and components. Methane 
emissions were then estimated by multiplying the respective 
emission factors according to the equipment type with the 
number of equipment of the same type. 
We are improving quantification of fugitive emissions by 
moving away from an estimation approach using 
production values, to a more detailed quantification 
method at component level, or using actual leak survey 
data where available. This method provides a better 
understanding of methane emissions from each source. A 
key finding was that quantified fugitive methane emissions 
using granular data were lower than calculated estimates. 
We also have a better understanding of our emissions 
from compressor seals and pneumatic devices, which 
were never quantified previously.
 80 per cent to 90 per cent of our methane emissions 
along the natural gas value chain can be attributed 
to hydrocarbon venting, flaring and gas-driven 
pneumatic devices. We prioritise our mitigation 
measures to these areas through our current GHG 
emissions reduction projects. 
2 
Advocating for Methane Management to Partners
As the regulatory body overseeing Upstream operations in Malaysia and collaborating with partners across the ASEAN 
region, PETRONAS has initiated methane advocacy efforts nationally as well as internationally with the aim to increase 
awareness among our partners to effectively manage methane emissions. Through Malaysia Petroleum Management 
(MPM), PETRONAS rolled out the Exploration and Production Minimum Environmental Specification (MES) that outlines 
the requirements on methane emissions measurements, quantifications, and reporting by all upstream operators that are 
operating in Malaysia. Adhering to these standards ensures that reported methane emissions are accurate and 
consistent, thereby driving efforts towards reduction.
The ASEAN Energy Sector Methane Roundtable
Hosted by PETRONAS and supported by Thailand’s PTT Public Company Limited (PTT) and Indonesia’s Pertamina.
Objective:
To set a networking platform among the oil and gas players in Southeast Asia to advocate and promote effective 
methane emissions management. 
Outcome:
 Attended by participants from ASEAN national oil companies, several energy companies, as well as international, multilateral and 
non-governmental organisations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), World Bank, United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP) and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF).
 Strong network presence at the roundtables set the foundation for promoting capability building and technical knowledge sharing, 
improving methane emissions management practices and transparency in performance reporting, aligned with internationally 
recognised frameworks and standards.

Accelerating Competency for Methane Management
Since 2020, we have increased our efforts to raise awareness, build skills, and take action to reduce methane 
emissions throughout our operations. We conducted training sessions to improve employee knowledge on methane 
management and put into practice internal standards. These standards were aligned with industry expectations and 
guidance on managing methane emissions.
In addition, we developed e-learning modules on methane management to promote self-learning and increase 
awareness on achieving methane reduction targets.
Harnessing the Power of Technology to Aid GHG Emissions Reduction
PETRONAS is continuously finding opportunities to reduce its carbon emissions to meet our NZCE 2050 Pathway 
through various climate actions. In 2022, we achieved GHG emissions reductions of 0.6 Million tCO2e and 
cumulatively since 2013, we have reduced 18.1 Million tCO2e of GHG emissions from our operations. PETRONAS has 
classified its operational emissions reduction efforts into four decarbonisation levers as follows:
In 2022, PETRONAS conducted five upskilling sessions on methane emissions management for 84 internal 
practitioners aimed at strengthening their understanding in support of operationalising our internal standards, 
aligning to industry expectations and guidance on methane emissions management. In addition, methane 
e-learning was also developed to create an avenue of self-development that could accelerate awareness on 
methane emissions management.

Safeguard the Environment
In 2022, PETRONAS completed 44 projects and initiatives 
mainly covering zero routine flaring and venting 
reductions, energy efficiency, and electrification categories 
as follows: 
1 
Zero Routine Flaring and Venting
PETRONAS had conducted three flare reduction and one 
vent reduction projects in Upstream Business in Malaysia 
where 0.18 Million tCO2e was reduced in 2022. The 
projects were conducted using technologies that recover 
the hydrocarbon gas and monetise it.
 Three Flare Reduction: Kinabalu (0.003 Million tCO2e), 
Bintulu Integrated Facilities (0.09 Million tCO2e), Sabah 
Oil and Gas Terminal (0.05 Million tCO2e); and
 One Vent Reduction: Dulang (0.04 Million tCO2e)
2 
Energy Efficiency
40 energy efficiency and optimisation efforts throughout 
PETRONAS have also reduced 0.44 Million tCO2e in 2022.
 Upstream: Three projects and 0.09 Million tCO2e
 Gas: 15 projects and 0.19 Million tCO2e 
 Downstream: 22 projects and 0.16 Million tCO2e
3 
Electrification
The intent of electrification is to either increase efficiency 
or to switch to an electric source with a lower GHG 
emission factor compared to the existing practice. In 
2022, Malaysia LNG Sdn Bhd signed a Power Purchase 
Agreement with Syarikat SESCO Bhd, a subsidiary of 
Sarawak Energy, for 90MW of hydroelectric power import 
to PLC in Bintulu. This will result in about 40 per cent of 
PLC to be powered by renewable energy and reduce 
Scope 1 GHG emissions. 
4 
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) 
CCS efforts in PETRONAS are driven by the need to develop 
high carbon dioxide (CO2) gas fields. PETRONAS has been 
conducting research and development (R&D) on various 
capture technologies and patented a single and multi-stage 
membrane technology for onshore and offshore application 
in the past years. PETRONAS has also identified potential 
storage sites in offshore Malaysia. This has become an 
enabler to the development of CCS projects in PETRONAS.
Upstream business has embarked on a CCS project in the 
Kasawari gas field in offshore Sarawak to reinject the 
inherent CO2 from the gas reservoir into a neighbouring 
depleted oil and gas field. The CCS facility is expected to 
be in operation in stages starting from 2024 (Phase 1), 
with first injection in 2026 (Phase 2).
When operations are in full swing, the Kasawari project can 
potentially store 3.3 Million tonnes of CO2 per annum in a 
depleted reservoir making it the largest offshore CCS 
project in the world. 
In 2022, PETRONAS signed several Memoranda of 
Understanding (MoUs) on CCS to partner and explore 
opportunities across the CCS value chain. Moving forward 
PETRONAS is also looking into building a CCS hub and 
becoming a leader in the CCS business within the region.
Methane Emissions Management
PETRONAS continues to explore the optimal top-down 
methane measurement via various MoUs to assess emerging 
technologies. Among the technologies tested in 2022 were 
satellite and drone to measure methane emissions from 
onshore and nearshore facilities. Based on the evaluations, 
suitable top-down measurement technology will be selected 
to enable reconciliation with bottom-up measurement and 
meet OGMP2.0 Gold Standard expectations.
We tested satellite technology to measure methane 
emissions where the results showed no emissions above 
the detection threshold of 100kg/hr at PETRONAS sites.
PETRONAS is pursuing another remote sensing technology 
through strategic collaborations with a local drone service 
provider to test methane sensors on drones (multi-rotor 
type) at selected sites i.e. gas transmission assets, refineries 
and regasification terminals.
PETRONAS also entered into a collaboration to test a 
technology that enables continuous monitoring of methane 
emissions from the assets through visualisation as well as 
measurement capabilities.
Striving Towards GHG Emissions Reduction Targets
As a result of our enhanced emissions accounting practices, 
which includes a change in organisational boundary, we 
have adjusted our 2019 baseline reference to 54.87 Million 
tCO2e (previously calculated 57.73 Million tCO2e) via equity 
share approach.
PETRONAS’ short-term GHG emission target is to cap 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 operational emissions to 49.5 Million 
tCO2e by 2024 for PETRONAS operated assets in Malaysia. 
In 2022, operational emissions in Malaysia amounted to 
46.11 Million tCO2e (2021: 44.12 Million tCO2e).
In 2022, we achieved 0.6 Million tCO2e GHG emissions 
reduction from projects and cumulatively since 2013, we 
have reduced 18.1 Million tCO2e of GHG emissions from 
the implementation of decarbonisation activities for 
PETRONAS Groupwide assets under operational control.
170
PETRONAS Integrated Report 2022
Our Sustainabilit y Journey
171


The mid-term target for 2030 is to reduce 25 per cent of PETRONAS’ Groupwide Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 
under equity share approach, compared to the base year of 2019. To date, the reduction amounts to 8.49 per cent, 
delivered through projects addressing flaring and venting reduction and energy efficiency.
Our short-term methane target is to reduce 50 per cent of methane emissions from our natural gas value chain 
operations by 2025 compared to 2019. In 2022, we reduced absolute methane emissions by 49.88 per cent from 2019 
levels, with Upstream flaring and venting reduction efforts playing a significant role. These efforts included setting flaring 
and venting targets, operational campaigns, and implementing capital expenditure projects. We plan to further reduce 
our methane footprint through continued reduction efforts and improved quantification accuracy.
Special Highlights
PETRONAS’ commitment to the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 (ZRF) Initiative and UNEP’s OGMP2.0 can be 
presented using the three key metrics below – Upstream GHG intensity, share of methane in total GHG emissions and 
reduction of hydrocarbon venting.
Upstream GHG intensity for 
total upstream operations has 
reduced by 32.73 per cent from 
2019 driven by zero continuous 
flaring and venting requirement 
in PETRONAS Carbon 
Commitments.

Responsible Waste Management
Why Is It Important?
Waste management is a major challenge for society, as the overproduction of waste negatively impacts the environment, 
health, and economic growth. Effective waste management can reduce operational costs and environmental impact 
while improving reputation and stakeholder trust. 
What Is Our Approach?
We practice the concept of waste management hierarchy, namely remove, reduce, reuse, recycle, recover, and dispose 
in order of most to least environmentally preferred. Across all our sites, activities that generate waste are categorised 
and identified according to type, quantity, frequency of generation, handling requirements, treatment and disposal 
methods. Our waste management plans are regularly reviewed, while performance indicators are submitted monthly to 
a central reporting platform, which helps measure progress and performance. Typical waste generated from operations 
include oily sludge from tank cleaning activities, sludge from wastewater treatment plant, spent catalyst and spent oils.
In 2022, PETRONAS generated 144,620 tonnes of hazardous waste, an increase of 19,736 tonnes from 124,884 tonnes 
in 2021. The higher amount of waste generated in 2022 was contributed by scheduled maintenance and tank cleaning 
activities. The total amount of waste recycled or recovered during the year in review was 73,643 tonnes of which 
63,133 tonnes was attributed by operations in Malaysia. These are equivalent to waste recycling and recovery rates of 
51  per cent for the Group or 77 per cent for Malaysia operations.
Guided by international principles, frameworks and standards:
 Host country requirements on waste management
 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards on waste reporting
Waste Management
1 
Managing Waste 
 
 In 2022, despite facing increased waste generation, we found opportunities to improve our waste management 
practices and increase our waste recycling and recovery rate, contributed largely by a close and continued 
collaboration between our operations and waste treatment technology and waste management service providers.
 
 Quarterly assurance assessments were also carried out at all off-site waste treatment and disposal facilities owned 
by our waste management contractors to verify that they meet both regulatory and our requirements. 
2 
Reducing and Reusing Hazardous Waste 
Oily sludge is one of the most common waste of our 
operations. In collaboration with the Shimizu Institute 
of Technology, we embarked on a pilot project to 
use carbonisation technology to treat hazardous 
waste, including oily sludge generated from the 
refining process. The initiative aims to explore broader 
means of a circular economy by reducing hazardous 
waste and reusing it for other purposes instead of 
merely disposing it to a licensed facility. The pilot 
project was funded by the Japan Cooperation Center 
for Petroleum and Sustainable Energy (JCCP), utilising 
selected sites provided by the Malaysia Refining 
Company Sdn. Bhd. (MRCSB).
During the Phase 1 pilot (50kg kiln), the identified 
hazardous waste types generated by MRCSB were 
tested in batches and was extended to other types of 
hazardous waste including Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO), 
used activated carbons, spent clay and effluent 
treatment sludges. The Phase 1 pilot test was 
completed in December 2022 and preliminary results 
showed promising results with 99.6 per cent to 99.9 
per cent of oil recovered from oily sludge samples 
and a weight reduction range of 84 per cent to 97 
per cent for all samples. Phase 2 pilot testing is 
planned in 2023, utilising 500kg kiln capacity. The 
pilot results will determine the feasibility for full-scale 
implementation.

Circular Economy
PETRONAS’ Circular Economy Definition
A circular economy is a systemic approach that 
moves away from a linear (take-make-waste) 
economy to one that extends the life cycle of 
materials and resources, ultimately reducing waste 
to a minimum.
For PETRONAS, circular economy is integral to 
our sustainability approach, embedded across the 
group to
i. 
enable a low waste future
ii. steward natural resources
iii. minimise our carbon footprint 
while creating value.
We aim to contribute to a circular future, 
providing impactful solutions to our stakeholders 
and the betterment of our society through 
innovation and collaboration. 
Why Plastics?
Plastics have become a vital component in the economy 
given its usefulness in our everyday lives. It is a durable 
and lightweight material that has been used widely across 
industries worldwide. However, when it is used or 
disposed in an irresponsible manner, it becomes a 
significant problem as it is made of non-biodegradable 
material. Plastic waste is a significant part of the problem, 
and we are addressing it by promoting a circular economy 
and moving toward a New Plastics Economy (NPE). By 
recycling plastic products, we are minimising waste, 
promoting innovation, and creating new business 
opportunities. This supports a circular supply chain, 
reduces carbon footprint, conserves raw materials, and 
lessens the use of fossil fuels, all of which contribute to a 
more sustainable future.
We are addressing this by promoting circular economy 
and moving towards a NPE. By recycling plastic products, 
we are minimising waste, promoting innovation, and 
creating new business opportunities. We believe that our 
shift towards circularity will have a positive multiplier 
1 
PETRONAS’ Positioning on Plastics
The increasingly harmful impact of plastic pollution on 
life and the environment is prompting regulations to 
crack down on plastic pollution, both globally and 
nationally, and has intensified in the last year alone, with 
industries facing the greatest risk and pressure to act. 
Plastic’s wide range of applications includes medical, 
hospitality, construction/building, as well as fittings and 
furnishings. What makes plastics ‘problematic’ are 
single-use plastics (SUPs), such as plastic bottles, cutlery, 
and containers that are almost certainly littered. These 
are the primary sources of plastic pollution, with plastic 
bottles accounting for the greatest volume.
This year, we introduced PETRONAS’ Position on 
Single-Use Plastics, which centres on our strategic focus 
on phasing out single-use plastics. 
As we have a wide footprint across the plastics value 
chain, both as producers and consumers, this presents a 
wide range of opportunities for us to transition according 
to our circular economy principles and sustainability 
approach. Through this positioning, we acknowledge that 
plastics are still useful in industries such as food 
packaging, medical equipment, household appliances, etc. 
and recognise the need to take steps to strengthen their 
design and end-use sustainability. This will be done by 
phasing out problematic and unnecessary SUPs. In 
addition, we will also develop systemic plastic collection 
and recycling mechanisms at our operations to stop 
plastic waste from polluting or leaking into the 
Value Creation in 2022
effect, as we have in place a long value-chain that serves 
our ecosystem partners and broader society. Our ability to 
do this supports a circular supply chain, reduces carbon 
footprint and renders better stewardship of raw materials.
What Is Our Approach?
Through the circular economy approach, we have taken a 
waste-to-products approach, where we convert waste to 
base materials or other products to create sustainable 
value. However, we believe that the circular economy is 
not just about recycling and reusing but, instead, solving 
the problem at its source to eliminate waste and pollution. 
This will help us realise our NZCE 2050 Pathway.
We also continue to deepen our research and technology 
to identify gaps and accelerate our circular economy 
initiatives, as this will ensure sustainable consumption. Our 
ability to do so will lead to creating a more resilient 
economy.
environment. This creates value by regenerating end-of-
life plastic into valuable materials hence closing the loop 
in plastic circularity.
PETRONAS has a considerable footprint in the plastics 
value chain, both as a producer and a consumer, 
which means there are opportunities for us to 
transition according to our circular economy principles 
and our approach to sustainability. This enables 
PETRONAS to continue protecting value while also 
being a force for good.
PETRONAS Chemicals Group (PCG) leads the NPE 
initiative as it has embarked on Operation Clean Sweep 
(OCS), which is a global programme to eliminate 
plastic resin leakage to the environment during 
production and distribution.
In support of this, PETRONAS Lubricants International 
(PLI) launched the Bag-In-Box in Europe. This is a new 
20-litre format made with recyclable cardboard and 
plastic, which guarantees loading, safety, and 
palletisation advantages, including an integrated tap.
Based on the recently launched Plastics Positioning, 
plastics will now be viewed as a force of good where 
we leverage circularity to encourage collaborative 
solutions that generate sustainable plastics, moving 
away from the traditional linear approach.

Producing Waste-based Fuels
We participated in the Mid-Term Review of the 12th Malaysia Plan (RMK-12) – Technical Working Group (Oil and 
Gas and New Energy) Workshop by the Ministry of Economy. We presented a paper on the development of 
bio-economy in Malaysia, where we communicated our capabilities in leading Malaysia’s bio-economy industry as a 
part of Malaysia’s decarbonisation journey in achieving NZCE 2050. Through this presentation, we highlighted 
Malaysia’s capabilities in being a regional leader in producing waste-based biofuels, especially Sustainable Aviation 
Fuel (SAF), Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO) and other biofuel products via our first bio-refinery in Pengerang. 
This biorefinery aims to achieve Final Investment Decision (FID) in 2023 and be commissioned by 2026.
The establishment of this bio-refinery will create a bio-economy ecosystem in Malaysia, including the full value 
chain for feedstock sourcing and biochemicals. Once fully operational, this bio-refinery is expected to drive the 
local economy, generate more than 5,000 new jobs, benefit more than 1,000 SMEs and attract more than USD2 
billion in green Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Malaysia.

Developing Plastic Modified Bitumen
We introduced our latest technology, Plastic Modified Bitumen (PMB), consisting of plastic waste mixed with 
bitumen. This mix of repurposed waste gives it extra strength and higher cohesiveness while reducing the 
maintenance lifecycle, making it a favourable material for infrastructure.
We tested these solutions at two separate locations, namely PETRONAS Research Sdn Bhd (PRSB) in September 
2021 and at the Malaysian Federal roads, Jalan Simpang Pulai-Lojing-Blue Valley in December 2022. 
Given the promising results, we will be collaborating with several government agencies in 2023. We will also be 
showcasing this technology to potential local and international partners. 
5 
Achieving a Circular Economy for Plastic Waste in Malaysia
Through PCG, we have set a target to recover 100 per cent of plastic waste equivalent to domestic polymer sales 
by 2030. To achieve this, we will focus on four key areas: innovation, infrastructure, education and clean-up. We 
are collaborating with various stakeholders, including waste management concessionaires, recyclers and technology 
providers, to create innovative solutions and enable a plastic circular ecosystem in Malaysia. This will enhance the 
recyclability of plastic materials and regenerate end-of-life plastic into valuable materials.
Under the innovation workstream, we collaborated with Plastic Energy Ltd to develop innovative solutions for 
plastic waste. This involves turning low quality, mixed plastic waste into pyrolysis oil, which can be further 
processed to produce certified circular polymers. 
To strengthen the infrastructure system, we partnered with waste management companies; namely Alam Flora, 
KDEB Waste Management, One Biosys and E-Idaman to unlock the value of plastic waste ecosystem in Malaysia. 
Through these partnerships, we can ensure a secure supply of plastic waste, which is a crucial feedstock for 
converting plastic waste into circular polymers.
 PMB will extend the lifecycle of pavement and roads by 25 per cent.
 Every 100 metres with plastic-modified bitumen utilises a minimum of 79kg of plastic waste.

PETRONAS’ Environmental Focus Areas
Why Is It Important?
Managing environmental quality is essential to the preservation of our planet and the protection of our natural 
ecosystem. Irresponsible business activities can have severe consequences, such as oil spills, air pollution and resource 
scarcity. These consequences not only affect the health and well-being of humans, but also pose a threat to 
biodiversity and the sustainability of our planet. Managing environmental quality involves responsible resource utilisation, 
pollution prevention and sustainable practices which can help mitigate these environmental consequences. 
From a business perspective, effective management of environmental quality can result in significant cost savings and 
improved operational efficiency and enhanced reputation. Minimising our environmental impact through responsible and 
sustainable practices can reduce waste, conserve resources and limit exposure to environmental liabilities. It also builds 
trust among our employees and reinforces our position as a corporate citizen.

In 2022, the Group’s sulphur oxides emissions 
increased to 60,116 tonnes compared with 47,954 
tonnes in 2021. The increase in emission load was 
attributable to higher gas production in Sarawak’s 
Upstream asset and gas processing plant.
Total nitrogen oxides emissions for 2022 stood at 
62,790 tonnes from 133,962 tonnes in 2021, mainly 
due to omission of emission load data from ships due 
to ongoing review of reporting method, and revision 
in calculation methodology for floating LNG and 
power plant.
What Is Our Approach?
At PETRONAS, we recognise the important role we have 
in managing our relationship with the environment. 
Throughout our operations and business, we implement 
various assessments, practices and site-specific actionable 
plans to protect the environment.
We continue to make significant investments to reduce 
our environmental impact by implementing and inculcating 
a strong environmental protection culture throughout our 
supply and value chain. As we work with a broad range of 
suppliers, partners and vendors, we ensure they are also 
optimising their environmental footprint in key areas. We 
do this by encouraging them to adhere to our sustainable 
practices and improve their own environmental footprint 
as well. We also pursue collaborations with our stakeholders 
to ensure we gain a wider reach. By working together 
with our partners and stakeholders, we can create a 
positive impact on the environment and protect it for 
future generations.

Biodiversity
Why Is It Important? 
Biodiversity is the total sum of life on Earth comprising 
flora, fauna, microorganisms, ecosystems and habitats as 
well as the interdependent relationships between all of 
them. We depend on this web of life, both terrestrial and 
marine, to gain access to fresh water, food, medicine and 
a stable climate – all of which help sustain livelihoods, 
human health and economies. 
Our inability to conserve and protect biodiversity will adversely 
affect the benefits it provides. For example, forests and 
wetlands are essential in our efforts to combat climate 
change by sequestering carbon while providing a habitat for 
various species, protecting coastlines and supporting 
surrounding communities as sources of livelihood. Where 
PETRONAS is concerned, our relationship with biodiversity 
is one of the impacts and dependencies where our 
activities could potentially impact the biodiversity around us.
At the same time, PETRONAS also depends on biodiversity 
and ecosystem services such as water, land and marine 
resources for the continuity of our operations. 
As such, we are responsible for protecting and, where 
necessary, reversing biodiversity loss to avoid irreversible 
damage, which may impact our ability to deliver on our 
business goals and Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 
Pathway. Within this context, protecting Malaysia’s 
biodiversity is important to PETRONAS, given our large 
operational footprint in the country and its large potential 
for forest-based carbon offsets and the fact that Malaysia 
is one of the 17 mega diverse countries in the world, 
despite its small land mass.

What Is Our Approach? 
In 2022, PETRONAS established our Position on Nature 
and Biodiversity (the Position) to improve oversight on our 
nature and biodiversity footprint at enterprise level and 
strengthen our attainment of NZCE 2050 aspiration. In 
establishing the Position, PETRONAS was guided by 
various international agreements and national policies such 
as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and 
Malaysia’s National Policy on Biological Diversity 2016-
2025, as well as industry best practices from organisations 
such as Ipieca (i.e., the global oil and gas association for 
advancing environmental and social performance across 
the energy transition), the International Association of Oil 
and Gas Producers (IOGP) and the World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). The Position 
consists of five areas of action that demonstrate visible 
leadership in nature and biodiversity conservation, 
harnessing the right expertise and resources to positively 
impact the nation and the ASEAN region.

Environmental Health 
Human Health Risk Assessments (HHRAs)
We are committed to safeguard the health of communities 
in areas where we operate.
We proactively conduct HHRA beyond facility fencelines 
to evaluate community exposure to chemicals in the 
ambient environment. Since 2018, we have been 
conducting baseline HHRAs at selected operations and 
continued our efforts in 2022 to establish the 
environmental health risk profile for our global operations. 
From the baseline HHRAs, we have identified areas of 
improvement to reduce chemical exposures in air 
emissions and groundwater, going beyond regulatory 
compliance.

inscription of properties on the World Heritage List.
PETRONAS’ Position on Nature and Biodiversity 
The introduction of our nature and biodiversity position enables us to accelerate our momentum in establishing plans 
and ensuring internal alignment on nature and biodiversity matters. We will shape the necessary work processes, 
systems and establish a centralised database to ensure the smooth implementation of this positioning, which will be 
enforced in 2024. To operationalise the Position during 2023, PETRONAS will also strengthen our capacity and 
capability on nature and biodiversity, including setting up a dedicated Centre of Excellence (CoE). Moving forward, we 
will continue to focus our efforts in making progress in the below key focus areas: 
Establishing 
voluntary 
exclusion zones
Managing 
nature and 
biodiversity risk
 Ensure no new operations or 
projects are conducted in 
UNESCO World Heritage Sites 
commencing 2024, in 
recognition of the Universal 
Values* of these sites. 
 Ensure no or minimal impact on biodiversity due to our operations 
and projects. 
 Achieve net positive impact (NPI) on nature and biodiversity from 
2024 onwards for new projects in Protected Areas and Key 
Biodiversity Areas.
 Develop a Biodiversity Action Plan for new projects in Protected 
Areas and Key Biodiversity Areas from 2024 onwards. 
 Existing “Very High” and “High Risk” operations identified through 
the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (BES) risk profiling, will also 
have Biodiversity Action Plans. 
 Establish a site-specific inventory of important biodiversity features 
at existing sites, with due consideration given to additional 
conservation measures using a risk-based approach. 
We will ensure governance 
mechanisms are embedded 
within our internal processes 
to ensure no new investments 
are made in UNESCO World 
Heritage sites, effective 2024. 
We completed the BES Risk Profiling for domestic operations in 
2020. We also conducted Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services 
Risk Assessment (BESRA) and prepared the Biodiversity Action 
Plan (BAP) for BES sites identified as “Very High” and “High Risk”. 
A preliminary desktop assessment was conducted for our existing 
international assets via the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment 
Tool (IBAT). We also performed further assessments to determine 
the risk rating, including via Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA), for projects located near environmentally-sensitive areas.

Health and Safety
Why Is It Important?
The health and safety of our employees and contractors is 
of paramount importance to us. Given the nature of our 
industry, our people are exposed to a range of health and 
safety risks, such as hazardous environments, exposure to 
pressurised hydrocarbon, gas and chemicals, as well as 
heavy machinery and equipment. Workplace injuries and 
incidents can lead to severe impacts for both our business 
and stakeholders.
The consequences of poor health and safety practices are 
far-reaching and can result in regulatory fines and 
penalties, stop-work orders and reputational damage.
But above all, our people’s physical and mental well-being 
are at stake, affecting their quality of life and ability to 
work and care for their families. Poor health and safety in 
the workplace can even lead to loss of life, with 
devastating effects on loved ones.
Four fatalities were recorded despite the increased focus 
on safety culture and improving safety practices. The 
fatalities reported were from fire, electrocution, dislodged 
pipeline and diving activity. Following these tragedies, we 
conducted four groupwide Health, Safety and Environment 
(HSE) stand-downs attended by 54,000 participants, 
underscoring our continuous commitment to prioritising 
the health and safety of our people. Immediate 
interventions have been implemented to address key 
issues and reduce incidents by strengthening frontliner 
and contractor competency, compliance to HSE 
requirements, as well as intensifying learning culture. 
We also observed a 33 per cent increase in employee 
Total Recordable Occupational Illness Frequency (TROIF) 
compared to 2021. Food poisoning was one of the 
contributors with 35 cases reported. To avoid recurrences, 
interventions were implemented to ensure our external 
caterers for food and water supply are verified by the 
Ministry of Health (MOH). 
]For more information about our health and safety performance, 
please refer to page 253]
Given the inherent risks in our industry, the ability to 
effectively promote a culture of safety throughout our 
operations enables employees and contractors to achieve 
their full potential, as they feel safe, secure and engaged. 
This will lead to a more high-performing and productive 
work environment. Moreover, investments in health and 
safety will strengthen our position as a caring and 
responsible organisation to retain top talent in the industry.
We have a comprehensive list of policies, guidelines 
and standards that ensure a culture of health and safety:
 PETRONAS HSE Policy
 PETRONAS Substance Misuse Policy
 PETRONAS HSE Management System (HSEMS)
 PETRONAS HSE Mandatory Control Framework (MCF)
 PETRONAS Technical Standards (PTS) 
 PETRONAS Technical Guidelines (PTG)
 Hazard Effect Management Process (HEMP) 
 Process Safety Loss of Primary Containment 
Reduction (PSLR) Framework
 Fire Prevention and Mitigation Framework (FPMF)
 PETRONAS Contingency Planning Standard
 Crisis and Incident Management System
What Is Our Approach?
At PETRONAS, we continuously reinforce a culture of safety 
across our operations, taking cue from the learnings gained 
over the last few years. This is important given the 
transformation in our work environment as the country 
transitioned into COVID-19 endemicity. We drive impactful 
interventions, mainly enhancing competencies and driving 
culture and assurance, enabled by digital technology. We 
continuously scale up contractor management and 
strengthen the implementation of the Generative HSE 
Culture (GC) programme at all levels through Accountability 
and Behaviour Reinforcement Programme (ABR). The ABR 
encourages HSE Desired Behaviours across our operations, 
and minimises undesired behaviours.
In addition to the current standards, guidelines, systems 
and processes, we pushed ahead on improving HSE First 
Line Assurance to drive HSE Management System and 
Legal Compliance groupwide, which included Self-
Regulation capability development. Meanwhile, Process 
Safety continues to experience further improvements with 
the establishment of the Loss of Primary Containment 
(LOPC) Reduction Framework and the Fire Prevention and 
Mitigation Framework (FPMF).
In terms of risk management, we subscribe to Hazards 
and Effects Management Process (HEMP) which ensures 
hazards and risks are controlled. We use As Low As 
Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) principle to set the control 
levels for risks. Additionally, we continue to leverage on 
HSSE Integrated Risk Assessment (HIRA), a one-stop centre 
for risk assessment located in myHSSE, which provides 
analysis, trends and also common issues that require 
efficient intervention.
As a leading integrated global energy company, we 
play a crucial role in shaping the future. We take a 
collaborative approach to embedding sustainability 
into our practices, working hand in hand with our 
employees, suppliers, and communities to promote 
responsible growth.

Culture
Shaping Generative HSE Culture Towards Self-Regulation
We strengthened our safety culture by introducing the Generative HSE Culture (GC) Framework, which promotes 
accountability and pace to business units, operating units and assets based on site-specific needs. Themed 
“Doing Things Differently”, we collaborated with Institut Teknologi Petroleum (INSTEP) whereby INSTEP will fully 
manage and execute the GC training programmes, and work towards Self-Regulation (SR) certification. This was 
done to enable Group Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) to refocus on enhancing the overall effectiveness of 
this programme, maintain standards and quality, perform continuous improvements and measure impact based 
on its alignment to SR requirements and expectations.
Regular engagements with key stakeholders across all business units were conducted to ensure alignment with 
the Generative HSE Culture framework and strategy to drive the GC journey forward.
Generative HSE Culture Highlights:
Generative HSE Culture Highlights:
• 25 engagement sessions to drive GC forward.
• Developed three new GC modules to align with Self-Regulation Framework.
• Total number of 1,209 GC participants trained in 2022.
• Developed governance documents on GC trainings in collaboration with INSTEP.
HSE Accountability and Behaviour Reinforcement (ABR)
Good behaviours often go unnoticed. But when things go wrong, we are quick to jump and forget to consider human 
factors. With HSE Accountability & Behaviour Reinforcement (HSE ABR), it is different. 
PETRONAS continues the implementation of HSE ABR programme, which was rolled out in 2021 to elevate the HSE 
Culture towards achieving Generative HSE Culture. The HSE ABR is to ensure a consistent approach across PETRONAS 
when recognising and rewarding the Desired HSE Behaviour, and fairness when addressing Undesired HSE Behaviour. 
In 2022, through the HSE ABR implementation, we achieved the following:
• Evaluated Human Behaviour Categorisation (HBC) elements in 97 per cent of completed investigations on major HSE 
incidents and major HSE non-compliances.
• 100 per cent domestic operations and selected international operations have HSE ABR Committee (ABRC) established.
• Successful integration of other HSE Systems with the HSE ABR system, which improves management of positive and 
constructive reinforcements.
Value Creation in 2022
We continued to reiterate the importance of building a culture of Health and Safety throughout our operations and
processes, as this will protect our employees, improve productivity and strengthen our reputation in the industry.
Digital myHSSE at PETRONAS
The myHSSE digital platform serves as our one-stop knowledge centre for all PETRONAS Health, 
Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE) matters.
By adopting a single information platform that houses all 16 systems of our HSSE digital 
solutions, each of which addresses different business pain points for users’ easier access and 
fit-for-purpose usage.
We are also enabling users to harness the power of HSSE data to derive insights on HSSE 
performance, trends, emerging risks and other essential elements so that we can make 
proactive interventions. As we move towards our goal of realising predictive and even 
prescriptive HSSE analytics. Group HSE endeavours to improve this further.

Crisis Management Information System (CMIS)
Launched in 2019, Crisis Management Information System 
(CMIS) is a digital solution that minimises human actions 
and communications errors by providing technology and 
systems to manage emergencies and crises at enterprise 
level.
CMIS has allowed us to enhance crisis management best 
practices as it provides real-time emergency response 
updates to internal stakeholders seamlessly transfer data 
and information. We have also integrated state-of-the-art 
oil spill consequence modelling tool (OILMAP) into CMIS 
to enable swift and comprehensive emergency response 
to oil spill incidents.
 Conducted 16 CMIS trainings and 2 webinars across 
PETRONAS Group. 
 Utilised in 8 Tier-2 and 2 Tier-3 emergency exercises, 
with positive feedback from stakeholders.
COVID-19 Reporting and Monitoring 
As Malaysia transitions towards endemicity and business 
activities resume, we ensured seamless and safe normalcy 
interventions on readiness and implementation of processes 
and procedures to return to office through 50 per cent 
work in office and 50 per cent work from home rotation 
and subsequently 100 per cent with Flexi-Work 
Arrangement, including opening up for unvaccinated and 
partially vaccinated employees, without disruptions.
As part of our COVID-19 reporting and monitoring, 
Strategic Crisis Management in collaboration with 
Occupational Health (OH) division, spearheaded the 
introduction of Microsoft Forms and a digital dashboard to 
replace the conventional Notification Form (NF) used 
previously to report COVID-19 cases. The dashboard 
provided overall insights into the latest COVID-19 situation 
across our businesses and operations. With this in hand, 
the Executive Leadership Team and Corporate Command 
Centre (C3) were able to make data-driven decisions and 
decide on the right approach to be taken by its Pandemic 
Preparedness and Response Team (PPRT). 
Our ability to make effective and swift adjustments amidst 
an evolving environment is considered to have led to a 
significant reduction in COVID-19 cases, clusters and 
deaths following the introduction of stringent measures 
and effective communications across all businesses and 
operations. 
Leveraging Digital Technology in Managing Crisis and Emergencies
PETRONAS Communication and Control Centre (COMCEN)
COMCEN is PETRONAS’ one-stop centre for incident and crisis management, as well as the designated centre to 
coordinate and respond to emergencies and crisis. This one-stop centre manages numerous HSE and Security-related 
incident notifications and crisis, including issuance of various HSE advisories and warnings across our businesses.
We implemented measures to protect the health of our 
workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic while ensuring 
business sustainability through effective collaborations 
between Pandemic Preparedness and Response Team 
(PPRT) COVID-19 members, internal and external 
stakeholders including government and private bodies.
Prioritising Industrial Hygiene
One of our topmost priorities is to ensure the health of 
our employees and contractors within and beyond the 
workplace. We go beyond regulatory compliance and 
implement global best practices to deliver sustainable 
value and ensure a dedicated, productive and high-
performing workforce. This include continuous efforts to 
address all workplace health hazards and respective risks 
such as chemical hazards, physical hazards (i.e., noise, 
radiation, thermal and vibrations), as well as biological, 
ergonomic and psycho-social hazards.
In 2022, we made progress on the following areas:
Hazardous Chemical Management
We strengthened the management of hazardous chemicals 
aimed to reduce overexposure to hazardous chemicals and 
increase compliance. One such initiative is an online digital 
platform named eCHEMS that manages and tracks the 
procurement, receiving and storage of hazardous chemicals. 
The digital system minimises human-interface manhours 
spent on verifying compliance of incoming procured 
hazardous chemicals and ultimately reduce the possibility 
of rejection at the receiving end. 
 Reduced 94 per cent of manhours to produce 
daily COVID-19 reports and achieved cost 
avoidance of up to RM300,000.
 Zero business and reputational interruptions recorded.
 Achieved 99.8 per cent primary vaccine uptake 
and booster uptake as compared to 49.7 per cent 
for Malaysia’s overall population.
In scaling up our efforts to improve safety performance, we proactively implemented various initiatives and measurements 
to ensure safety precautions are embedded throughout our businesses and operations.
Achieving HSE Compliance Through Self-Regulation (SR)
We continue to improve on our Self-Regulation practices and strived to achieve Self-Regulation certifications as this 
would result in a higher level of compliance towards legal and safety standards, as well as effective implementation 
measures to control hazards and minimise incidents.
We focused on driving key engagements and alignment of the Self-Regulation Implementation Masterplan with key 
stakeholders and completed the necessary pre-certification audits and Self-Regulation culture assessments. We also 
ensured Self-Regulation Department (SRD) personnel obtained the required certifications to strengthen SRD as a 
qualified third-party auditor for Self-Regulation implementation and surveillance audit in PETRONAS.
In terms of governance, we officialised the Self-Regulation Tripartite comprising members from Regulator (DOSH), 
Occupiers (PETRONAS OPUs) and Third-party Service Providers (Institut Teknologi PETRONAS (INSTEP) and Universiti 
Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP)) as a platform that advocates Self-Regulation governance and regulations to support and 
sustain SR Programme journey towards operational and compliance excellence. We also completed the integration of 
PETRONAS Self-Regulation System (PSRS) with other relevant PETRONAS systems namely PETRONAS Risk-Based 
Inspection (PRBI), myAssurance and Health, Safety, Security, and Environment (HSSE) Monitoring and Reporting System 
(MARS), creating an integrated digital platform for the SR programme implementation which was deployed to all OPUs 
embarking on the programme.
Compliance
Conducted SR Implementation Masterplan engagement with 24 CEOs and OPU Heads including leaders from 
Upstream governance departments, as well as Department of Occupation, Safety and Health (DOSH) state 
representatives to share and roll-out the Masterplan. 
Achieved certification for 22 out of 27 SRD personnel with ISO45001 as Lead Auditor by Chartered Quality Institute 
(CQI) and International Register of Certificated Auditors (IRCA) in preparation for SRD to become the SR Qualified 
Third-Party for PETRONAS. 
Conducted 10 stakeholder engagements and workshops with OPUs and DOSH representatives to facilitate and 
provide the necessary advisory on the development and implementation of Self-Regulation programme. 
Completed seven audits and Culture Baseline assessments in four OPUs as part of their overall journey 
towards SR certification.

done through Noise Engineering Control studies targeting 
identified high noise-emitting equipment and enhanced 
controls.
Digitalising the Health Risk Assessment (HRA) 
Health Risk Assessment (HRA) was digitalised and 
integrated into HSSE Integrated Risks Assessment (HIRA). 
We implemented the enhanced HRA methodology, 
focusing on operationalisation and integration into other 
Safe System of Work (SSOW). The enhanced methodology 
includes a newly-developed psychosocial risk assessment 
(PsyRA), improving how workplace psychosocial risk 
factors are being identified and assessed.
 Operationalisation of HRA output within other 
Safe System of Work, and overall company health 
risk profile.
Advanced Ergonomics Risk Assessment (ERA)
We fortified the Ergonomics Risk Management by 
implementing the Advanced Ergonomics Risk Assessment 
(ERA) Tool, which is known as Humantech and 
Ergonomics Control Inventory. 
 Reduced ergonomic risk from 60 per cent in 2021 
to 20 per cent in 2022 and achieved time saving 
for 50 tasks in 12 locations through Advanced ERA. 
Improved Risk Management Related to Industrial Hygiene
We continue to conduct First Line Assurance for Business 
Units, OPUs and our assets, which looks into managing 
risks related to Industrial Hygiene that are linked to 
day-to-day operational activities. We achieved increase in 
overall compliance as follows: 
Reduced noise  
exceeding limit by
60%
and zero cases in 
noise overexposure. 
 Seven Second Line Assurances and 17 
unannounced visits were conducted at selected

Proactive Security Risk Management
The robustness of our security controls and practices is 
vital to how we do our business. Gap closure efforts, 
assurance activities, penetration tests and security drills 
were some of the key activities carried out in the year 
under review covering selected domestic and international 
assets. A key effort included fortifying and streamlining 
compliance to our Security Policy via execution of the 
PETRONAS Group Management Framework, with roll-out 
planned in 2023. The Groupwide undertaking to enhance 
governance and assurance marks a formalised approach to 
accelerate security excellence in all that we do, through 
clear, concerted and coordinated initiatives, supported by 
improved communication on demarcation of roles and 
responsibilities. 
Additionally, we continued to provide proactive security 
insights to facilitate informed management decision that 
take into account evolving external vulnerabilities.
2 
Partnering for Greater Security
We believe in fostering closer ties with various 
stakeholders in Malaysia, including enforcement agencies, 
to strengthen security excellence for propelling energy 
security. 
In 2022, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding 
(MoU) with the Royal Malaysia Police to further strengthen 
collaboration on security awareness and the integration of 
best practices via cooperation in training and operational 
support. This aims to spur collective knowledge sharing 
and enhanced capabilities for PETRONAS’ onshore and 
offshore assets in Malaysia. 
The aim is to strengthen our resilience and robustness as 
we navigate a more dynamic business environment. 
We also worked with various enforcement agencies to 
strengthen maritime security, deploying a range of assets 
for optimum surveillance of our offshore interests 
including unmanned platforms. The joint operations led to 
zero intrusion cases between June and December 2022. 
We also leveraged our Auxiliary Police (AP) personnel at 
our onshore assets in Malaysia. The APs are entrusted with 
enforcement powers as stipulated in the Police Act 1967. 
The coverage of PETRONAS’ APs also includes certain 
offshore platforms that have been identified as national 
Value Creation in 2022
critical infrastructure. Targeted joint operations with the 
local enforcement agencies were carried out on several 
occasions. 
Additionally, we partnered with the industry players to 
drive collective action via the Sahabat Maritim programme 
to drive awareness on the dangers of vessel 
encroachment within the 500 metre safety radius 
surrounding our offshore operation. The programme 
ongoing since 2015, also educates local communities in 
Sabah and Labuan on wider security and safety 
implications.

Preventing Substance Misuse
Substance misuse can result in security issues, leading us 
to embark on Tempat Kerja Bebas Dadah (TEKAD), a 
programme under the Agensi Antidadah Kebangsaan, 
AADK, Malaysia.
TEKAD is a strategic partnership to promote a workplace 
free of substance misuse. It promoted discussions across 
multidisciplinary teams on illegal, prohibited substances 
and arising complexities if mismanaged.
The awareness programme involving staff and contractors 
also included a Training of Trainers (ToT) for our Auxiliary 
Police (APs) to undertake urine screening for drug 
detection. This was conducted as per the Police Act, P.U.A 
461/1970 and relevant clauses/sections from Act 234 
(Dangerous Drugs Act 1952) and Act 283 (Drug 
Dependants (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Act 1983). 
5,108

We are fully committed to implementing a high-level, well-coordinated and integrated 
security approach that safeguards our assets, ensures the safety of our people wherever we 
operate and provides sustainable value for our stakeholders.
Security
Why Is It Important? 
Persistent geopolitical tensions, global economic 
uncertainties, increased competition, extreme weather 
patterns and accelerated technological development have 
increased security concerns. Given our wide geographical 
spread and the asset-heavy nature of our operations, we 
are strengthening our security preparedness further to 
withstand the changing risk environment.
Our business value chain including offshore and onshore 
assets are exposed to protests, violence, crime, insider 
threat, terrorist attacks and geopolitical conflicts. The 
increasing use of technology has also led to cybersecurity 
threats and consequently cyber-crimes which call for a 
holistic focus on enterprise security management. These 
interruptions may lead to incidental exposures, operational 
disruptions, supply chain breakdowns, ransomware, price 
risks and decreased productivity, which lower our ability to 
deliver sustainable stakeholder value. We are committed to 
maintain a high-level, well-coordinated and integrated 
security approach for the integrity of our assets and safety 
of our people, wherever we operate.
What Is Our Approach?
Our emphasis is on ensuring security excellence 
throughout our value chain. We continuously elevate our 
in-house security culture, harnessing physical security 
infrastructure and technologies to optimise business 
efficiencies and productivity whilst providing a conducive 
workplace. We also embed a security mindset into our 
organisational culture, supported by coordinated cross-
functional awareness measures. 
We are governed by the laws and regulations of the 
countries where we operate. Our practices are supported 
by robust internal governance stipulations that are 
regularly updated to help us adapt to the ever-changing 
external operating environment. With the rising focus on 
digital security, we fortified our priority on digitalisation, 
operational and strategic security acumens, steered by 
governance, compliance, capabilities, communications and 
technology application. 
We established a security academy with targeted 
programmes to hone a pool of capable security personnel 
and equip them with suitable capabilities. We offer timely 
security training and ground exposure that prepares 
colleagues to manage security effectively, particularly at 
our high-risk operations. 
We also pursued industry-wide engagements to uphold a 
conducive working environment and prevent maritime 
security threats on our shores in Malaysia.

To propagate security via discourse on timely topics of interest in effort to drive security uptake through better 
understanding and appreciation of security acumen across the operational and strategic fronts. 
Outcomes
 10 webinars, including some for a groupwide audience. Some of these sessions attracted between 200 to over 
500 participants.
 Wide range of topics including security risks, security geopolitics and security behaviours. (e.g. Terrorism, country 
updates and revolutionising security through technology, Kidnap for Ransom, Cybersecurity, Fix the Leak, 
Information Sharing and Raya Festive Season travel safety advisory).
 Developed podcasts, with three episodes dedicated to Climate Change, Security and Human Rights. The insights 
reflected correlation between security and sustainability, enabling better appreciation on the role of security in 
realising long-term business growth. These podcasts also featured PETRONAS subject matter experts and their 
views on how security is a vital aspect of sustainability.
We established a Security Academy to enhance our security practitioners’ skills, knowledge, and capabilities, enabling 
them to deliver optimum value and provide equitable services as a business growth partner. 
Additionally, identified personnel also attended sessions on Drone Certification, Train the Trainer, Basic Investigation 
Technique, Basic Forensic Technique and Basic Marine Survival among others. These sessions focused on striking a proper 
balance across the technical, strategic, and leadership spheres, emphasising the familiarisation of law and regulations.
Towards this end, we conducted several key efforts, some of which included:
4 
Strengthening Security with Technology
Our security personnel are our frontliners protecting our 
assets, information, employees and communities to ensure 
uninterrupted operations. Hence it is vital that we equip 
them with the latest security equipment and cutting-edge 
technology.
In 2022, we completed a pilot project in in Pengerang, 
Johor, to maximise our AP’s enforcement powers by 
expanding their focus into marine, investigation and air 
units. In addition to testing a drone surveillance and 
monitoring system at the PETRONAS Twin Towers and the 
East Coast Region, we introduced a facial recognition 
system at the PETRONAS Twin Towers to improve security 
at our headquarters. Concurrently, we engaged relevant 
authorities and agencies on proactive counter-drone 
measures – exploring the feasibility of drone jammers the 
need for streamlined standard operating procedures on 
drone management activities for the corporate sector in 
Malaysia. 
We also enabled centralised monitoring with an Integrated 
Security Control Centre, equipped with an Emergency 
Communication Centre (ECC), Mobile Monitoring Control 
System (M2CS), and drone technology. PETRONAS was 
also among pioneering corporate organisations to deploy 
body-worn cameras at our headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia, thereby safeguarding our premises.
 Obtained certification for 81 identified 
personnel (73 APs and eight executives) as drone 
operators, aligned with the Civil Aviation 
Authority of Malaysia (CAAM) regulations.

We also signed an agreement with University Teknologi 
PETRONAS (UTP) to collaborate on various security 
analytics technology initiatives. This partnership 
encourages participation between academic and industry 
practitioners to venture into research on data, 
cybersecurity and physical security analytics.
 Three joint-ventures are being pursued through

Positive Social Impact


What Is Our Approach?
Identifying exposure to potential human rights risks and impacts, mitigating and addressing them are important in our 
operations. Salient potential human rights issues material to PETRONAS are:
Labour and Working 
Conditions
  Forced and trafficked 
labour in contractors’ and 
subcontractors’ workforce. 
 Child labour.
  Condition of employment 
and work.
  Discrimination in hiring 
and contractual terms. 
  Freedom of association 
and collective bargaining.
  Workers’ health and safety. 
  Workers’ camp conditions. 
Community Well-being
 Community health and 
safety. 
 Access to natural 
resources for health, 
cultural needs and 
livelihood.
 Land acquisition and 
involuntary resettlement 
with/without economic 
displacement.
 Indigenous peoples.
 In-migration.
Supply Chain
 Contractor/supplier 
performance related to 
labour and working 
conditions, community 
well-being and security.
Responsible Security
 Use of force and conduct 
of third-party security. 
 Provision of Human 
Rights training for staff 
and third-party security.
Our human rights approach is embraced and advanced by 
our leaders, with clear governance processes to ensure 
implementation and accountability. Our commitment is led 
from the top, our work in human rights is overseen by the 
PETRONAS Board and ELT.
The Board and ELT regularly discuss human rights as part 
of our approach to sustainability, reviewing issues with 
actual or potential impact, where a business-critical 
decision needs to be taken, or where substantial financial 
investment may be needed to address the impact.
Efforts to uphold human rights are integrated throughout 
our organisation and extend to our broader ecosystem, 
including suppliers, contractors, partners and the 
communities we serve.
Our Due Diligence
To minimise social risks and their impact on our 
employees, partners, contractors and communities, we 
have established technical standards and guidelines on 
due diligence that include assessments on indigenous 
peoples, cultural heritage, land acquisitions and involuntary 
settlement as well as grievance mechanism. Our Social 
Performance technical practitioners lead our due diligence 
programmes, identifying, mitigating, tracking, and 
monitoring potential human rights issues.
We also require human rights due diligence for potential 
mergers and acquisitions. As we transition to a low carbon 
future, we ensure our processes, tools, and practices 
remain updated and applicable in identifying how new 
energy infrastructure and developments impact human 
rights. We also share best practices with our supply chain 
partners to ensure the effective implementation of human 
rights due diligence.
Throughout 2022, there were no reported violations 
involving indigenous peoples’ rights. There was also no 
activity on land acquisition and involuntary resettlement.
As part of our policy, we do not practice discrimination 
on any grounds. We continuously conducted reviews, 
strengthened policies and practices to ensure employees 
rights on equality and non-discrimination were upheld.
There were no complaints of discrimination received in 
2022, based on our Industrial Relations data.
Access to Remedy
Grievance mechanisms create channels for dialogue, 
problem-solving and investigation and are applied to 
provide timely and fair remedies when needed. Workers 
and other rightsholders can raise complaints freely and 
with the expectation of obtaining effective and transparent 
resolutions. It also helps to identify country-specific 
solutions and actions to avoid recurrence.
Our grievance mechanism covers HSE, security, labour and 
working conditions, and supply chain concerns where we 
operate. We have designated personnel, community liaison 
officers and online complaint channels to manage grievances.
Additionally, PETRONAS contractors are required to 
establish a grievance mechanism for their workforce within 
our value chain. This mechanism shall be made known 
and communicated in relevant languages, providing a way 
to report grievances while ensuring that the identity of the 
person filing the grievance is protected. The grievance 
mechanism must adhere to the United Nation Guiding 
Principles (UNGP) ‘access to remedy’ pillar.
Positive Social Impact
Human Rights
Why Is It Important?
Respecting human rights is essential for our social license to operate. It is our responsibility to manage human rights 
risks and impacts arising from areas of our operations while contributing to society in a responsible, ethical and 
transparent manner.
PETRONAS is committed to respecting human rights in areas of our operations, complying with our Code of Conduct 
and Business Ethics (CoBE) and all relevant legal requirements. 
Respecting human rights across our value chain, inclusive of employees, suppliers, contractors, partners and 
communities where we operate is very important to PETRONAS in upholding our duty as a business enterprise. Human 
rights is the foundation of sustainable development and creating positive social impact comes with proper management 
of social risks. Upholding human rights through fair and ethical practices is fundamental to our business. It creates a 
safe and secure operating environment that complies with laws and regulations and meets the expectations of our 
stakeholders. Respecting human rights is also essential to achieve our purpose in being a progressive energy and 
solutions partner, enriching lives for a sustainable future. 
To support our Human Rights Commitment, we integrate controls throughout our systems and processes including risk 
management, procurement and supply chain, HSE, human resource management, business operations, legal and 
security. The following standards, policies and guidelines guide us:

Our Sustainabilit y Journey
205


We conducted several engagement sessions with our employees to raise awareness of the risks associated with child or 
forced labour practices. We also collaborated with the Department of Labour Peninsular Malaysia to share our initiatives 
and gain a deeper understanding of the revised regulations.
New Suppliers Screened Using Social Criteria
Under the PETRONAS Contractors 
Code of Conduct on Human Rights 
(CoCHR), we require our contractors to 
respect internationally-recognised 
human rights and comply with the 
PETRONAS Code of Conduct and 
Business Ethics (CoBE). We expect our 
contractors and suppliers to adhere to 
labour and working condition principles: 
freedom of labour, prevention of child 
labour, wages and benefits, working 
hours, grievance mechanism, non-
discrimination, freedom of association, 
humane treatment and foreign and 
migrant workers.
1. From 2018 to 2022, PETRONAS 
conducted CoCHR Self-
Assessments for identified new 
contracts and performed CoCHR 
Compliance Assessments based on 
the Self-Assessment results.
2. In 2022, the CoCHR survey was 
sent to 510 contractors.
3. Out of the 510 contractors, we 
identified 22 contractors with high 
risk exposure on human rights in 
2022 and we completed 100 per 
cent CoCHR compliance on those 
contractors to understand their 
situations and challenges. 
Generally their gaps were on 
informal grievance mechanism 
within their workforce and lack of 
grievance management within their 
supply chain.
Results from the online surveys conducted from 2019 – 2022 indicated that 
we managed to maintain more than 90 per cent awareness building among 
contractors for two consecutive years. Using CoBE as our baseline, the gap 
has narrowed to less than 5 per cent in 2021 and 2022, compared to about 
20 per cent in 2019 and 2020.

Contractors Code of Conduct on Human Rights (CoCHR)
We continue to reinforce our commitment to human rights across our value chain, by assessing compliance on 
our Contractors Code of Conduct on Human Rights (CoCHR). The CoCHR is our supply chain due diligence on 
labour and working conditions, requiring ethical practices from our contractors in compliance with the PETRONAS 
Human Rights Commitment. We value contractors who share our commitment to integrity, anti-bribery and 
anti-corruption practices and sustainable development. Compliance with the CoCHR, including the principle of 
freedom of association and collective bargaining, is mandatory for all contractors. This requirement has been 
embedded into our procurement processes in Malaysia, where respect for human rights has become a contractual 
obligation for all goods and services providers who participate in our procurement process. 
Positive Social Impact
Strengthened Governance
1 
Included Human Rights Section to the 
Revised PETRONAS Code of Conduct and 
Business Ethics (CoBE)
In 2022, we updated the PETRONAS CoBE to include 
a human rights section under Part III: Workplace, 
Culture, and Environment. The revised policy 
mandates all employees, contractors, partners and 
those involved in our operations to uphold the 
principles of respect for human rights and take 
measures to mitigate social and human rights risks, 
prohibit child labour, engage in or support human 
trafficking or modern slavery, including forced, 
bonded, or involuntary labour.
2 
Sustained PETRONAS’ Commitment to Zero 
Forced Labour and Child Labour in Malaysia-
Based Supply Chain
We continue to uphold our pledge to eradicate 
forced and child labour in all our operations as part 
of our firm commitment to respecting human rights. 
We comprehensively assessed our contractors 
performing high-risk activities from 2019-2022 to 
ensure full compliance with our human rights 
policies and practices. Bureau Veritas Certification 
(M) Sdn Bhd, a third-party verifier, assessed our 
supply chain due diligence on qualitative and 
quantitative data related to our key performance 
indicators for the PETRONAS Contractor Code of 
Conduct on Human Rights (CoCHR). The results 
affirmed that PETRONAS has adequate supply chain 
due diligence, and there was no evidence of child 
or forced labour practices within our supply chain.
We found no incidents of child and forced labour in 
the reporting year. To further strengthen the 
awareness and understanding of risks related to child 
and forced labour among our employees, we have 
organised an engagement as well as a Masterclass on 
Forced and Child Labour on 5 July 2022, with a 
speaker from the International Labour Organisation 
(ILO), and a Masterclass on Standard and Industrial 
Research Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM) 501 Social 
Accountability Standard on 17 November 2022.  
Value Creation in 2022
These efforts were organised to promote and elevate 
our employees’ awareness and knowledge of child 
and forced labour risks. Understanding the child and 
forced labour indicators and why they are essential, 
ensures our employees can identify potential child 
and forced labour risks in their respective operations.

Strengthened Social Risk Assessment 
Implementation
An evaluation on the effectiveness of social risk 
assessment (SRA) implementation was conducted by 
sampling 20 per cent of total SRAs for the past five 
years. No deviations were found from our SRA technical 
standard, indicating effective implementation of the 
assessment process. Enhancements were also made to 
our digital SRA tool from the review, with an upgrade of 
the SRA documentation from guideline to standard.

Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) in India 
 
We reviewed the adequacy of controls to manage 
potential child and forced (bonded) labour risks in our 
operations across India. 
The risk of child or forced labour is low due to 
compliance with regulatory requirements, strict 
penalties, and limited activities for contractors in our 
facilities in India. We have recommended further 
improvements to minimise our risk exposure, as listed 
below:
• Enhancement of contractor management to 
include human rights awareness briefings, and 
fit-for-purpose contractor self-assessments on 
labour, potential collaborations with partners or 
within joint ventures (JVs) on respect for human 
rights initiatives, revision of Codes of Conduct and 
relevant processes to align with revised CoBE, 
assessment of adequacy of controls on forced or 
bonded labour risks across the value chain, as well 
as assessment of forced and child labour risks 
across key contractors and suppliers. 
• These include source material to comply with 
regulatory requirements such as the Factories Act 
1948, The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) 
Act 1986, Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976 
and The Payment of Minimum Wages Act 1948.

SIRIM 50 is a Malaysian social accountability standard that assesses an organisation’s compliance with health and safety 
regulations and Malaysian labour laws and ethical practices. It defines social accountability requirements consistent with those in 
other international social standards such as ISO 26000 and SA 8000.

Social Risk Assessment with Local Communities 
Social risk assessments were conducted throughout our 
projects and operations to ensure we could identify, 
assess and mitigate any social and human rights risks 
which may affect the communities where we operate.
In 2022, we conducted seven Social Risk Assessments at 
our projects and operations. Based on the findings, there 
were no significant actual and potential violations involving 
rights of the communities surrounding our operations.
Grievance Management 
Evaluation of Effectiveness of First Line Assurance
We have a Grievance Mechanism First Line Assurance (GM 
FLA) that acts as the first point of contact for resolving 
issues, thus addressing complaints swiftly and effectively.
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the grievance 
mechanism (GM) implementation was conducted by 
sampling 100 per cent of GM FLA. Results found that 97 
per cent of operating units comply with the GM 
requirements, with a 47 per cent increase in assurance 
implementation from 23 per cent in the previous year. 
First line assurance by the operating units
is risk-based.

the Grievance 
Mechanism e-learning 
module, compared to 
1,440 the previous year.
206

Grievance Management in 
2022.
Total of 559 employees 
upskilled to date.
All seven grievance cases were closed in 2022. The 
number of grievances do not necessarily describe the 
effectiveness of the system as it is the outreach, trust and 
confidence in the system that is critical to us.
The evaluation on the effectiveness of our grievance 
mechanism processes in 2022 shows positive results, and 
we also acknowledge that there is room to further 
encourage our rightsholders to continue using our GM 
channels towards managing potential risks and impacts to 
the community, employees and contractors where we 
operate.

Screening for a Sustainable Supply Chain 
PETRONAS’ suppliers and contractors are encouraged to embrace sustainability principles and be accountable for its 
implementation. 
Our suppliers are at various stages of implementing sustainability practices across their respective businesses. We 
provided our assistance through multiple engagements and training programmes to help them progress. 
We organised the 101 Sustainability Awareness session, in collaboration with Yinson Holdings Berhad and SOLS Energy 
Sdn Bhd to strengthen our vendors’ understanding and responsiveness towards sustainability. We conducted a second 
sustainability awareness session titled Shifting Towards Sustainability, later in the year in collaboration with our Strategic 
Research division, Sustainability Energy Development Authority (SEDA) and Kenanga Suria Sdn Bhd.

Simplifying Procurement with Technology
Our supply chain productivity and efficiency have been greatly enhanced through technology adoption. By digitising 
and automating our procurement process, we have been able to optimise our resources, reduce costs and effectively 
respond to disruptions. Our focus was process automation to enable contactless buying experience for low value 
purchasing activities.
As a result of these efforts, as well as internal cost optimisation and efficiency initiatives, we enabled local OGSE 
industry players to serve PETRONAS more efficiently while improving the pace of the end-to-end procurement process.

A Resilient and Agile Supply Chain is Essential for our Operations and Stakeholders. 
Supply Chain Management
Why Is It Important?
PETRONAS relies on a range of products and services 
throughout our value chain, sourced from a vast global 
network of suppliers. 
Ethical and sustainable supply chains aid in product 
development, safeguard workers’ rights, and enhance 
operational safety. We view our supply chain as an 
opportunity to contribute to positive socio-economic 
impacts. It allows us to channel financial capital into 
businesses, including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), 
empowering their growth in environmental protection, 
responsible sourcing and procurement practices.
What Is Our Approach?
Our suppliers must adhere to policies and standards in 
managing environmental and social impacts across our 
integrated oil and gas value chain. 
We have zero tolerance towards non-compliance, 
including our environmental and social standards. We 
conduct capacity building and engagement sessions to 
build capability and strengthen the resilience of the 
industry. To this end, we have been collaborating with 
nine financial institutions on the Vendor Financing 
Programme (VFP) to facilitate access to funding for 
vendors since 2018. We have also introduced Special Oil 
and Gas Services and Equipment (OGSE) Financing which 
targets underserved vendors with less than five years of 
experience. In driving sustainability, we partnered with 
industry players and government agencies by participating 
in the National OGSE Industry Blueprint roadshows in the 
Klang Valley, Sabah and Sarawak. We also participated in 
strategic forums such as the National OGSE Sustainability 
Forum.
We collaborated with OGSE industry players through our 
Vendor Development Programme (VDP) and SMEs to 
promote local entrepreneurship to contribute to socio-
economic growth and improve communities through an 
increase in employment opportunities.

Positive Social Impact


Why Is It Important?
Product stewardship is a vital aspect of ensuring that our 
products meet customer needs and sustainability 
considerations. When developing innovative products and 
solutions, we take a life cycle approach in meeting 
stakeholder expectations through minimising impact on 
health, safety and the environment throughout a product’s 
entire life cycle.
Product stewardship in PETRONAS comprises a range of 
cross-functional disciplines, including product safety and 
regulatory compliance, toxicology, ecotoxicology, 
environmental health, product sustainability and life cycle 
assessment. We also collaborate with stakeholders across 
extended product supply chains, going beyond compliance 
to improve our offerings, ensuring safer and sustainable 
products that are in line with customer preferences.
What Is Our Approach? 
We remain steadfast in our commitment to managing risks 
and enhancing the performance of our products across 
their entire life cycle. Our approach to Life Cycle Thinking 
ensures that we take comprehensive steps to 
systematically assess, control, and communicate product 
HSE risks. These elements are integrated into our 
operations, from R&D and raw material sourcing to 
manufacturing, distribution, product application, consumer 
use and disposal.
Product safety and risk assessments are regularly performed, 
updated when necessary and communicated in order to 
ensure we do our part in safeguarding the environment 
and enabling our products to have a positive social impact 
through responsible use and application. We conduct 
comprehensive raw material assessments and product Life 
Cycle Assessments (LCA) to add value to products by 
meeting emerging stakeholder expectations and managing 
future product risks effectively. These practices are 
embedded into our standards and systems to ensure 
robust and responsible governance processes are in place 
which enables continuous improvements to product 
stewardship performance. 
In addition to ensuring efficient procedures and effective 
communication with our partners and customers, we leverage 
digital and toxicology laboratory technology to safeguard our 
product compliance (licence to operate) in new markets, 
build customer loyalty and drive technical competency. Our 
commitment to managing product risks and enhancing 
performance is integral to our continued success.

Improving the Industry Through Our Supply Chain
As an integrated energy solutions provider, we play an important role in promoting Malaysia’s OGSE industry 
development, guided by the National OGSE Blueprint 2021-2030. This is to ensure we meet market demand, harness 
efficiency and drive innovation and opportunities for local companies to expand into new markets. The aim is to 
promote a healthy ecosystem, improve competitiveness on a global scale while safeguarding strategic national interests 
and contributing to the country’s economic growth. 
Our activities included hosting the Vendor Financing Programme (VFP) Conversation Day in collaboration with Malaysian

Product Stewardship
Positive Social Impact


4 
 Strengthening Product Safety and Regulatory 
Compliance Governance
Operating internationally through integrated supply 
chains with a broad spectrum of products poses its 
own unique challenges. We place importance on 
product safety and regulatory compliance governance 
to ensure alignment with PETRONAS’ overall 
objectives and aspirations. We have leveraged 
PETRONAS Group product stewardship situational 
assessments in order to:
• Identify areas of risk and enhance internal product 
stewardship standards with leading practices to 
ensure our products continue to be safe for 
intended use through evidence-based approaches. 
• Identify areas for simplification and/or optimisation 
in managing our product regulatory compliance 
processes, as evident in the roll-out of a dedicated 
emergency response number to ensure any 
product-related emergency calls are professionally 
managed, with adequate coverage internationally. 
5 
Raw Material Compliance 
As part of our efforts to drive product safety and 
sustainability, product raw material assessments have 
been identified as a key lever. With the introduction 
of our Raw Material Information Request (RAWMIR) 
process, key product stewardship information 
regarding presence of Substance of Very High 
Concern (SVHC) and conflict minerals1 have been 
curated for the majority of our products and specific 
cases for phase out or substitution have been 
initiated.
Due diligence on 250 raw materials used in PCG’s 
products revealed that no conflict minerals were 
supplied to PETRONAS. Efforts are ongoing to 
complete conflict minerals due diligence across the 
wider Downstream and Upstream businesses.
 
The RAWMIR process was also extended to Oil Field 
Chemicals (OFCs) in order to obtain key 
environmental performance related to the Offshore 
Chemical Notification Scheme (OCNS). Data 
pertaining to aquatic toxicity of OFCs was obtained to 
enhance our efforts to reduce risk from produced 
water discharges.
6 
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) 
 
 We continued to drive and embed Life Cycle Thinking 
across our businesses and operations, as well as for 
new projects and product development. The LCA 
approach was also used to quantify and prioritise the 
usage of low environmental impact raw material 
formulations, including formulating products with 
lower carbon footprint. This allowed us to capitalise 
on new business opportunities and generate income 
for PETRONAS.
 
 
We conducted a cradle-to-gate assessment, 
beginning from resource extraction (cradle) to the 
factory gate (before it is transported to the 
consumer). This approach is aligned with our 
integrated value chain, ranging from extraction to 
downstream product completion.
 
 Engagements with relevant stakeholders were 
conducted to encourage knowledge sharing on the 
concept of LCA and gain the necessary information to 
develop life cycle inventory data. In the absence of 
suppliers’ information, we leverage our experience in 
developing the PETRONAS LCA database.
1 In politically unstable areas, conflict mineral trade can be used to finance armed groups, fuel forced labour and other human rights 
abuses, and support corruption and money laundering. Conflict minerals are tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold (refer to EU Regulation 
2017/821).
Product Stewardship and Toxicology
Key Highlights of 2022
1 
Operation Clean Sweep
Working closely with the Malaysian Plastics 
Manufacturers Association (MPMA), PETRONAS 
Chemical Polyethylene Sdn Bhd and PETRONAS 
Chemical LDPE Sdn Bhd officially registered our 
pledge under Operation Clean Sweep® (OCS) which 
is the global plastics industry initiative that aims to 
reduce polymer pellets, flake and powder loss to the 
environment. PETRONAS Chemicals Group Berhad 
(PCG) became the first OCS signatory in Malaysia, 
demonstrating our commitment to safeguard the 
environment in this important area by performing 
detailed onsite assessments and implementing 
solutions to prevent polymer loss to the environment. 
Recognising the importance of industry-wide 
participation, moving forward we endeavour to drive 
this important agenda by encouraging wider adoption 
of OCS within our polymer supply chain.
2 
 Establishing PETRONAS’ Maiden Toxicology 
Laboratory 
 
 We are establishing PETRONAS’ first toxicology 
laboratory to support R&D of safer and sustainable 
chemicals. The laboratory will enable early screening 
of key health and environmental hazards of candidate 
chemicals at pre-prototype stage. This will provide a 
feedback loop for product design improvement to 
create less hazardous products and minimise impact 
on the environment and human health. The 
laboratory emphasises non-animal test methods to 
ensure wider regulatory compliance as well as future 
regulatory preparedness.
3 
Ecotoxicology Assessments 
 
 We continuously assess the environmental performance 
of our products to promote the use of safer and 
sustainable chemicals. Data from internationally 
accepted and reliable ecological tests based on the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) test guidelines were utilised to 
improve relevant product hazard profiles.
 
 Produced water risk-based assessments continued to 
be conducted at our selected onshore terminals in 
order to address the ecological risk of discharged 
produced water on sensitive receptors in coastal and 
marine ecosystems.
36 LCA studies 
completed for products 
across Downstream and 
Gas businesses.

Positive Social Impact


Creating an Inclusive Culture 
We remain focused on creating an intentionally inclusive 
culture. We do this by reinforcing the right behaviours and 
mindset to sustain an environment that will help us 
progress and accelerate our ability to deliver on our 
commitments. Our talent composition in 2022 comprised 
of 29 per cent women, which was an improvement from 
28 per cent in 2021. We employ over 100 nationalities 
and 40 per cent of our total population is aged 35 years 
and below.
Driving Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) 
Diverse ideas, views and backgrounds create a more 
progressive work environment which in turn delivers better 
outcomes. In creating an intentionally inclusive culture, we 
drive change through leadership and governance, 
communication, education and culture. 
1 
Leadership and Governance 
The Board of Directors approved our baseline and 
targets as we work towards more focused efforts on 
D&I. We are governed by requirements in areas where 
we operate and aim to seek and nurture local talents 
for senior management roles across the Group. 
We collaborate through reputable associations and 
organisations, such as the International Association of 
Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP), World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the World 
Economic Forum (WEF) to network and benchmark 
global practices of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
(DEI). In 2022, our Senior Vice President of Group 
Human Resource Management was assigned the role 
of Commissioner in the Business Commission to 
Tackle Inequality (BCTI) by WBCSD.
In ensuring diversity of thought at all levels, 
myTalentX was introduced in 2022 as a digital 
platform to identify potential leaders through a 
process of transparent and effective succession 
planning.
2 
Communication 
Strategic conversations with the Board were held on the 
topic of ‘Equity’. The conversations covered the 
foundation and fundamentals of Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion (DEI), leading best practices, priorities and 
commitment going forward on the matter. The Board 
were also updated on PETRONAS’ progress and efforts 
towards D&I.
3 
Education
The Conscious Inclusion Programme was rolled out 
to raise awareness on the importance of D&I to 
PETRONAS. We conducted engagement sessions with 
the Board and upskilled and trained more than 250 
PETRONAS leaders groupwide.
We launched e-Learning modules on Inclusive 
Mindset for middle managers and executives which 
were attended by 278 participants.
 282 employees received counselling with a total 
of 954 hours, a 15 per cent increase from 2021.
 70 per cent of employees who received counselling 
reported the therapy to have been effective.
 Digital coaching increased by 119 per cent from 
533 individual sessions in 2021 to 1,166 individual 
sessions in 2022. 
 Number of callers to the EAP Careline dropped 
14 per cent to 700 from the previous year’s 811.
Employee Well-being 
Why Is It Important?
Our people are our most valuable asset and their well-
being is our priority. As we recognise that a healthy 
work-life balance is essential for our employees’ 
productivity and job satisfaction, we encourage flexible 
work arrangements, provide access to wellness 
programmes and offer a range of other initiatives to 
promote employee well-being. By investing in our 
employees, we promote a more motivated and engaged 
workforce that is better equipped to contribute to our 
business success.
In addition to promoting employee well-being, we are 
also committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in our 
workplace. We believe that embracing diversity brings new 
perspectives, fresh ideas and a wealth of talent to our 
organisation. This allows us to tap into a wider pool of 
talent, foster innovation and improve decision-making. Our 
commitment to create an inclusive work environment 
where everyone feels valued, respected and supported will 
contribute to wider positive societal impact, and is also a 
key driver to our progress. A diverse and inclusive 
workplace is essential for creating value and driving 
sustainable growth.
What Is Our Approach?
We take the time to understand the unique needs of our 
employees and introduce relevant programmes anchored 
on PETRONAS Cultural Beliefs and Shared Values to create 
an environment where they can thrive and help us achieve 
our strategic priorities.
We believe that connecting with peers both within and 
outside their scope of work allows employees to nurture 
their professional and personal interests. We encourage 
participation in various clubs, company-wide initiatives and 
volunteering activities that contribute to a positive workplace 
culture — instilling a sense of belonging, safety, passion 
and purpose over the long term.
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is guided by 
the PETRONAS Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) programmes, 
focusing on four key areas: gender, multinational, age and 
culture. Meanwhile, our Wellness Steering Committee 
oversees employee health and well-being, including 
mental health. 
PETRONAS also has processes and controls in place to 
ensure we comply with applicable wage laws. We 
conducted market analysis to ensure competitive 
compensation. In Malaysia, compensation is on average, 
20 per cent above minimum wage thresholds. 
Value Creation in 2022 
Empowering People through Flexibility
Flexible Working Arrangement (FlexiWork)
We introduced FlexiWork to allow our people to balance 
between their professional and personal commitments, 
ultimately being their best selves while delivering for the 
organisation. We put in place safety measures to ensure a 
smooth back-to-office transition for our employees post 
COVID-19 pandemic. We reinforced awareness on the 
existing FlexiHours and FlexiWear that complement the 
current FlexiWork Arrangement.
We also established the PETRONAS Work Hub to enable 
employees who work either from home or the office to 
access information on best practices, digital tools and 
available support to help them sustain and where 
necessary improve their productivity levels. Consistent 
communication was also carried out on COVID-19 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure the safety 
of our employees and those that they encountered, at 
work and at home. 
Caring for Our People’s Support System
Employee Assistance Programme (EAP)
The EAP named myFriends was launched together with 
our MESTIFit4Health wellness programme in 2017 as part 
of PETRONAS’ effort to care for the welfare of our people 
by providing psychological interventions to build personal 
resilience, reduce emotional distress and destigmatise 
mental health issues. In 2021, Enhanced EAP or EAP 2.0 
was introduced, integrating our EAP with advances in 
psychology and coaching programmes via a digital 
platform accessible all day with comprehensive 
multidisciplinary support by digital physical and mental 
health care provider, Naluri Hidup Sdn Bhd to employees 
and sponsored students globally. 
We extended the EAP 2.0 in 2022 to family members to 
help them cope with their mental well-being as an 
important measure to support our employees’ overall 
health and performance.
4 
Culture
In strengthening a culture of D&I, we rolled out the 
D&I module via the PETRONAS e-Survey to encourage 
employees to speak up on the topic. We conducted a 
forum on building an inclusive workforce featuring 
internal and external speakers. It was attended by 
1,600 employees virtually and in-person.
We introduced myCareerX, an integrated HR platform 
that enables employees to take charge of their own 
career journey. The platform promotes transparency 
within the organisation and gives employees equal 
opportunities to explore other roles available across 
PETRONAS. This allows for a more diverse and 
inclusive talent pool as we work towards developing 
the workforce of the future.

Akademi Laut Malaysia (ALAM) that provide energy industry-related curriculum and training programmes.
Value Creation in 2022 
Existing Talent
For our existing talents in the company, we focused on the 
five key Capability Development Priorities, supported by our 
in-house learning institutions and platforms, enhanced talent 
ecosystem and a sustainable pool of leaders.
Sustainability 
We scaled up efforts in building our people’s knowledge 
and capabilities in the area of sustainability to accelerate 
our ability to deliver our NZCE 2050 Pathway and fortify 
trust among stakeholders.
Sustainability Capability Development Framework 
The Sustainability Capability Development Framework was 
developed as part of our efforts to equip employees with 
sustainability-related knowledge, practices and processes. 
We also identified learning pathways and priorities for 
leaders and top talents, functional sustainability 
practitioners and the broader employee population.
Advancing Sustainability Conversations 
Engagement with Leaders
We engaged leaders through conversations to raise 
awareness on the need for change and to improve 
understanding of how the organisation’s performance 
can be enhanced. 
We engaged with members of the PETRONAS Board and 
the Board of Directors of our public-listed companies to 
help oversee sustainability-driven strategies and guide 
stakeholder-oriented long-term goals. Executive leaders 
received guidance in developing a strategic direction that 
is aligned to organisational purpose, strategy and business 
models that contribute towards society and the 
environment. 
One of the Top Leaders Dialogue sessions in 2022 
featured the launch of our NZCE 2050 Pathway and 
provided our leaders with greater clarity on sustainability 
challenges and targets. As a result of this dialogue, leaders 
felt more engaged, aligned, inspired and united in 
purpose.
On a global level, we also took part in sustainability 
conversations and leadership programmes provided through 
our membership in the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development (WBCSD), a network of around 
200 leading companies committed to advancing sustainable 
business practices.
Improving Sustainability Knowledge and Skillsets 
Colleagues from across the Group benefitted from a range 
of learning opportunities made available to enhance 
relevant knowledge and functional skills to drive and 
shape future sustainability practices.
 101 employees completed training programmes 
on sustainability delivered by the Cambridge 
Institute of Sustainability Leadership, Yale School 
of Management, Harvard Kennedy School, 
Institute of Management Development and Centre 
for Sustainability and Excellence.
 132 sustainability change agents were appointed.
 84 employees were upskilled with Level 1 
Methane Emissions knowledge.
 289 employees including top leaders, have 
attended sustainability masterclasses.
We also carried out awareness-building initiatives for all 
employees to ensure they were able to apply the 
knowledge obtained on sustainability, its drivers, tools and 
approaches in their daily actions. Towards this end, a 
sustainability e-learning module was also made 
compulsory for all new hires.
Talent and Future Pipeline
Why Is It Important?
We are currently in the midst of an era of energy transition, which is predominantly driven by the need to transform 
the global energy system for a low carbon future. To capitalise on opportunities that the transition brings, our most 
valuable asset – our diverse group of talented employees – must be equipped with skills, capabilities and experience 
that are relevant for the future.
As competition for talent increases, we are focused on transforming our workforce to be ready to achieve our strategic 
priorities, including delivery of our Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 (NZCE 2050) Pathway. By empowering and 
nurturing existing and potential talents, we can create a more equitable and sustainable future and contribute to 
economic growth, while positioning ourselves as a preferred employer in the industry.
What Is Our Approach?
We believe in upholding a high-performance culture, where we attract and retain talents with critical skills and offer 
opportunities for upskilling and reskilling. We recognise that our employees are crucial for business sustainability and we 
want to ensure that they are equipped with the right skills, mindset and behaviour; hence, we invested RM264 million 
in employee training and development in 2022.
Our five key Capability Development Priorities for developing our people to meet evolving needs are:
Sustainability
• Elevate sustainability practices by expanding awareness programmes.
• Equip or acquire talents with technical expertise to embed sustainability into decision-
making and daily operations.
Continuous 
Improvement (CI), 
Agile and 
Innovation
• Agile and Innovation skills to ideate, incubate and scale new ideas. Continuous 
Improvement (CI) play a big role in delivering business results to maximise cash flow and 
improve efficiency.
Digital
• Accelerate digital solutions through digital literacy programmes.
• Equip or acquire talents with technical expertise in automation and advanced analytics to 
improve productivity, enable better decision-making and utilise data for competitive 
advantage.
Technical and 
Functional
• Technical and functional capabilities needed to grow our businesses.
• Equip or acquire talents with expanded technical and functional expertise.
Leadership
• Nurture leadership at all levels to ensure talents deliver desired results expected from their 
roles, establishing a robust and sustainable succession plan for driving Core and Growth 
business respectively.

Digital
Digitalisation and technology play a heavy role in our 
transition towards net zero carbon emissions. We 
recognise that the future of work will involve increased 
cross-functional collaborations and automation to improve 
productivity and decision-making, supported by data to 
drive competitive advantage. Therefore, we need to equip 
our employees and acquire new talents with the right 
technical depth, tools and methodologies in automation 
and advanced analytics to harness value from digital 
solutions.
Collaboration with Industry Players
We collaborated with Microsoft and Tata Consultancy 
Services to share new perspectives in our Knowledge 
Series webinars. We strengthened our position in the 
digital segment over the long term, partnering with 
Accenture to develop a customer-centric approach to 
building digital products. We also co-hosted the Amazon 
Web Services (AWS) User Group Meet-Up, where we 
extended our PETRONAS Cloud Community of Practice 
(CoP) to external cloud enthusiasts.

including Kesatuan Pekerja-pekerja Optimal 
Chemicals Malaysia Sdn Bhd (KEPKO), attended 
our sustainability-themed engagements and 
information sessions.
Agile 
In response to the dynamic pace of change experienced 
across the energy industry, we intensified efforts to 
develop more agile capabilities through our Agile 
Leadership and Capability Programmes. This will enable 
our people to ideate, incubate and scale new ideas and 
deliver customer solutions at pace.
As part of our goal to strengthen talent capabilities, we 
continued to enhance the Agile Coaching Enablement 
(ACE) programme by integrating it into the PETRONAS 
Leadership Centre to improve agile-based knowledge 
and application. We also strengthened the agile 
leadership platform by improving exposure to outside-in 
good practices on business agility through key 
engagements and learning programmes. In addition, we 
infused agile leadership topics into key leadership 
programmes and engagements such as the Top Leaders 
Dialogue sessions.
Continuous Improvement (CI), Agile and Innovation
We believe that being agile and innovative are critical 
factors in realising our transition towards a low carbon 
future. At the same time, we also need to effectively drive 
business performance and maximise cash flows. 
Continuous Improvement (CI)
As a business entity, we continue to equip our people with 
the right knowledge, methodologies, skills and mindset to 
understand and improve our current business processes. 
This will ensure sustainable operations and cost efficiency 
in meeting customer needs and business objectives.
Since PETRONAS Lean Six Sigma (PLSS) was introduced in 
2016, production performance has become more 
sustainable, with reduced cost, increased productivity and 
enhanced customer satisfaction. We have upskilled more 
than 11,000 employees on CI Awareness and developed 
almost 2,000 PLSS practitioners.
The PLSS process is subject to an annual Maturity 
Assessment to sustain the deployment of LSS across the 
organisation. In 2022, six operating units reached the 
status of PLSS Matured Organisation, namely Project 
Delivery and Technology (PD&T), Malaysian Refining 
Company Sdn Bhd (MRCSB), Global HR Services (GHRS), 
Engen Limited, Malaysia LNG Sdn Bhd (MLNG) and 
PETRONAS Chemicals Methanol (PC Methanol).
 143 PLSS improvement projects were executed.
 Saved 216,821 manhours.
 Over 4,000 employees upskilled in CI Awareness.
 299 practitioners were certified in PLSS: 228 
Yellow Belts, 66 Green Belts, five Black Belts.
 185 practitioners were trained in PLSS: 148 Green 
Belts, 31 Black Belts and six Master Black Belts.
 Achieved 57.77 per cent Process Cycle Efficiency (PCE).
Nurturing Innovative Capabilities
We continued to strengthen our employees’ capabilities 
in order to build an innovation ecosystem across the 
Group. Taking advantage of the rapid progress made in 
building the foundation for innovation in 2021, the 
PETRONAS Working Backwards (PWB) Methodology and 
innovation framework was expanded to business 
divisions in PETRONAS and the Innovation Masterclass 
was established as a permanent offering at the 
PETRONAS Leadership Centre (PLC). 
As a result, innovation practitioners are actively ideating 
and incubating high potential projects, contributing to 
the innovation opportunity funnel and boosting new 
business possibilities for growth in Core and New 
Business areas.

Powering Innovation
We recognise the need to change the way we think and 
work as an organisation as we navigate towards a just 
transition. Towards this end, we have created an 
ecosystem where ideas are incubated, tested and scaled 
to market by supporting key PETRONAS innovation 
initiatives, namely PETRONAS Innovation Garage (PING), 
SEEd.Lab and FutureTech Accelerator.
Driving Sustainability 
In line with our net zero carbon emissions 2050 pathway 
commitments, PLC serves as a platform to upskill leaders 
in sustainability and at the same time build sustainability 
advocacy across the organisation, from the environmental 
and human capital perspectives. We have also designed 
and built a new campus to drive our sustainability efforts.
PLC hosted
500
leaders on 
sustainability 
matters via 
various 
engagements 
throughout the 
year
PLC also hosted several key events, namely the 
PETRONAS Race2Decarbonise Hackathon and a roundtable 
forum on Road to COP27: Alignment on Energy Sector 
Decarbonisation to support National Narratives on Net 
Zero GHG Aspirations, with the Malaysian Government’s 
Economic Planning Unit (EPU) to demonstrate our strong 
commitment in lowering our carbon footprint in support 
of Malaysia’s environmental agenda. 
Sustainability Efforts at PLC 
Aligned with PETRONAS’ approach to sustainability, PLC’s 
campus is built with a green vision. It is environmentally 
responsive with energy-saving architecture as well as 
green and digital technologies in place. Our campus has 
achieved the Platinum status of the Green Building Index 
Malaysia Certification and Leadership in Energy and

Green Building Council.
 
Biodiversity
• Total area of 35 acres (including lakes, streams and 
landscapes) to provide habitats for flora and fauna 
such as indigenous plants, butterflies and 
dragonflies.
• 2,160 trees planted, which can potentially absorb 
64.8 tCO2e equivalent to the amount of carbon 
dioxide produced by 127  air conditioners running 
for a year.
 
Wastewater Management
i. Greywater
• Wastewater generated from hand-washing basins 
is collected, filtered and used for toilet flushing, 
which reduces water demand and costs.
ii. Rainwater Harvesting Tank
• Rainwater is stored in four storage tanks with a 
maximum storage capacity of 1,368 m3 and is 
used for landscape irrigation. This capacity can 
wash up to 228,000 linen bedsheets.
 
Waste Management
• A maximum of 150,124 kg of food waste per year 
can be fed into a vessel composting system. This 
generates an estimated 10,509 kg of compost per 
year that may be used as fertiliser for PLC’s 
landscape.
 
Reduction of Heat Island Effect
• Man-made lake with water volume of 14,203 m3 
(equivalent to approximately 5.7 Olympic-sized 
swimming pools), reduces the air temperature 
surrounding the building.
• Main building facade is orientated north-south to 
minimise solar heat gain.
 
Energy Generation
• 4,066 photovoltaic (PV) panels installed to generate 
an estimated 2.3 million kWh/year, equivalent to 
the ability to power up 327 double-storey houses 
per year.

Technical and Functional
We focused on strengthening the foundational capabilities 
of our people in our efforts to further grow our traditional 
portfolio of oil and gas, as well as prepare them in our 
pursuit of non-traditional growth to ensure PETRONAS’ 
long-term survivability. To achieve this, we aim to increase 
our capability strength to 75 per cent by 2025.
 Recorded a 62.5 per cent capability bench strength 
for Technical Skill Group (SKG) and 40.4 per cent 
for Business SKG.
We recognise that capability building is especially 
important for our new businesses such as Renewable 
Energy; carbon capture and storage (CCS); and Remote 
Autonomous Operations (RAO). As such, we continued to 
upskill our people via formal learning and On-the-Job 
learning (OJL).
Various upskilling programmes were also conducted and 
tailored to the needs of the respective businesses as we 
continued to develop our people in strengthening our 
core business. Programmes included Multi-Skill 
Acceleration Programmes for technical non-executives 
from the Upstream business and digital marketing for the 
marketing and trading teams from the Downstream and 
Gas businesses, while Project Delivery and Technology 
(PD&T) employees were provided training based on our 
new focus areas. A Capability Development Framework 
review was conducted for Risk Management fraternity 
while Finance saw the establishment of the Finance 
Academy, a structured learning platform to strengthen 
core or niche skills in support of new business areas. 
Leadership Development
Continuous development of leaders at all levels is essential 
in creating a robust talent pipeline and sustainable bench 
strength for effective succession. Working with reputable 
partners, we focused on three key areas to develop 
leadership skills, equipping senior leaders to lead and steer 
the workforce towards achieving organisational goals, 
continuously building a pipeline of leaders and supporting 
competency upskilling or reskilling programmes and new 
ways of working for talents. 
In-house Learning Institutions and Platform
We continued to accelerate capability development by 
leveraging our specialised learning institutions namely the 
PETRONAS Leadership Centre (PLC), Institut Teknologi 
Petroleum PETRONAS (INSTEP), the Centre for Advanced 
and Professional Education at Universiti Teknologi 
PETRONAS (CAPE UTP), Akademi Laut Malaysia (ALAM), as 
well as the myLearningX virtual learning platform. In 
creating a future-relevant workforce, these learning 
institutions and platforms provide opportunities for our 
talents to be upskilled on leadership and the energy 
industry as a whole.
PETRONAS Leadership Centre (PLC)
The PETRONAS Leadership Centre (PLC), previously known 
as PERMATA when it was established in 1989, was created 
to develop progressive leaders that would not only make 
an impact on our organisation, but also the global energy 
industry. The new PLC campus was completed in 2022.
Developing and Nurturing Leaders 
The programmes at PLC are designed to equip leaders 
with the skills and knowledge required to tackle the most 
pressing challenges faced across their diverse functions 
and industries. Towards this end, we ensure that our 
content is consistently relevant and delivered via the latest 
learning and development practices.

Talent Ecosystem 
We empower and enable our people to drive their career 
progression through a robust talent ecosystem.
In 2022, we continued to enhance our principles and 
processes, particularly in the areas of employee 
performance management, career progression and 
personal marketability, all of which are supported by an 
integrated HR platform called myCareerX.
Refreshed Employee Performance Management 
(EPM)
We refreshed our EPM for the wholesome development of 
our employees and an enhanced end-to-end talent 
journey for them by nurturing a growth mindset and 
behaviour. The refreshed EPM aligns performance 
objectives with individual aspirations, commits employees 
to roles and responsibilities with the needed competencies 
and promotes a self-driven culture based on continuous 
feedback and coaching. 
The refreshed EPM via myCareerX has enabled easy 
access for our employees and their managers to monitor 
performance and facilitate continuous performance 
conversations.
We also enhanced the Underperformer Management 
system to proactively carry out early intervention for 
identified employees.
We changed the PETRONAS Cultural Beliefs Behaviour 
Evaluation (BePCB) Guidelines into a 360-degree 
evaluation from the earlier 180-degree version. With this 
change, our employees’ direct managers and team 
members were able to give feedback, as well as managers 
and members from other teams whom they have worked 
with.
We also embedded open and transparent values in BePCB 
to encourage employees to speak up in performance-
related conversations, with a focus on learning and 
development aspects.
Enhanced Career Progression Principles

in late 2021, which enables role-based progression 
anchored on competency, and a simplified decision-
making process from 2022 onward.
We initiated a pilot programme within the Human 
Resource fraternity, focusing on the following areas:
• Enabling our people to progress within and across roles 
while balancing business and talent needs, in line with 
matching employees’ aspirations with organisational 
goals.
• Promoting competency-based progression through 
fit-for-purpose assessments, with performance managed 
through EPM.
• Simplifying the decision-making process by empowering 
line managers to make progression decisions for 
manager-level and below.

Industrial Training Programmes 
We provide industrial training opportunities for graduates 
and tertiary students through the Graduate Employability 
Enhancement Scheme (GEES) and internship programmes 
for on-the-job learning (OJL). These will help prepare 
students for better employment opportunities which would 
contribute towards improving their standard of living 
ultimately contributing to the socio-economic upliftment 
of the community.
Graduate Employability Enhancement Scheme 
(GEES)
GEES provides graduates with actual working experience 
as part of our soft skills training programme, in support of 
the Malaysian government’s Protégé Ready-to-Work 
initiative. It is a 12-month on-the-job training that aims to 
enhance the employability of new graduates towards 
securing long-term employment. We do this by instilling 
positive work attributes, including entrepreneurial training 
to encourage them to establish and manage their own 
business. We also provide technical bridging training to 
upskill students in relevant technical skills to facilitate their 
transition into the job market.
Since its inception in 2011, the programme has benefitted 
4,683 participants.
PETRONAS Internship Opportunity Programme 
We provide undergraduate students with industry experience 
and learning under our internship programme where they 
are able to gain knowledge outside of their academic 
setting. Our aim is to enable students to integrate theories 
and knowledge obtained from learning institutions and 
actual work situations in a professional manner. 
Through this programme, students will gain their first 
working exposure in the energy industry and the 
opportunity to engage across various operational areas. 
This enables them to put their learning into action and 
equip themselves with useful skills upon joining the 
workforce.
We invested over 
RM30 
million in 2022 to 
train 1,760 
new graduates 
under our GEES 
programme.
1,403
students from local and 
international universities 
participated in our internship
programme.
A Sustainable Pool of Leaders
Effectively identifying potential leaders is key to successful 
succession planning. myTalentX was designed to ensure a 
sustainable pipeline of leaders through comprehensive 
insights on talent, succession planning and position 
requirements across PETRONAS, leveraging AI-enabled 
recommendations to identify best fit talents as successors 
for key positions. In addition, myTalentX provides real-time 
data on top talent for faster decision-making in meeting 
business demands. 
 Close to 20,000 employees were able to 
access Talent Profile to build their 
personal marketability.
 Over 10,000 users have used the Talent 
Profile to update their personal 
information and explore potential roles.
 Talent Profile was intentionally used for 
talent deliberation in PETRONAS.
Future Talent
We continued to invest in identifying and nurturing our 
pipeline of future talents through our sponsorship 
programmes and learning institutions.
Sponsorships
PETRONAS Education Sponsorship Programme 
(PESP)
Since 1975, we have successfully awarded education 
sponsorships to more than 38,000 young students with 
high academic calibres from diverse ethnic and economic 
backgrounds, with the majority from underprivileged 
families. Through PESP, we offer young Malaysians and 
others the opportunity to pursue their studies at UTP as 
well as other leading local and international universities.

they are continuously nurtured until graduation. Students
are also given the opportunity to interact with our leaders
to inspire and help them achieve their potential.
 Invested more than RM174 million through 
education sponsorships awarded to 587 Malaysian 
students.
 64 per cent of our scholars were recruited to 
work for the organisation upon graduation.
 Seven per cent of our graduates were recruited 
by other companies. 
 Five engagement sessions between scholars and 
PETRONAS leaders were conducted both locally 
and internationally to inspire students to push 
their potential towards success. 
Enhancing Personal Marketability via Talent 
Profile 
We encourage our people to drive their own talent 
journey within the organisation. With this in mind, we 
introduced Talent Profile in myCareerX, which is a digital 
resume to allow our employees to be visible within the 
organisation, market themselves and attract managers and 
team leaders who are looking to build their team.

Community Engagement
Why Is It Important?
Active engagement and community development are 
essential for building trust, establishing goodwill and 
maintaining positive relationships with the communities 
where we operate. By engaging with local communities 
and stakeholders, we understand their needs, reduce 
conflicts and minimise the risk of project delays or 
cancellations. This demonstrates our commitment to 
sustainable operations and nurtures a positive reputation. 
Investing in local communities stimulates economic 
growth, improves quality of life and creates a more 
supportive environment for our business. Building strong 
partnerships creates shared value contributing to our 
overall success and sustainability.
What Is Our Approach?
At PETRONAS, we are committed to building strong, 
resilient and empowered communities through community 
engagement efforts. Our initiatives aim to improve the 
standard of living, enhance livelihoods, promote equitable 
growth and increase environmental awareness. We take a 
structured and systematic approach by developing a 
community engagement strategy that aligns with our 
business objectives and values while addressing the needs 
and aspirations of surrounding communities. Our Social 
Impact programmes focus on education, community 
well-being and development, and the environment, to 
encourage sustainable livelihoods and equip communities 
with the necessary skills for a just energy transition, a fair 
and inclusive process that aims to ensure no one is left 
behind.

 Assisted 180 patients under the SHAPE programme.
 95 per cent attendance rate (HIV beneficiaries) 
adhered based on scheduled appointments.
Supporting Cancer Research
Yayasan PETRONAS continued to support cancer research 
for the Asian population and paediatric patients by 
providing grants to Cancer Research Malaysia (CRM) and 
Hospital Canselor Tuanku Mukhriz (HCTM) in 2022. These 
grants will drive new research to address cancer more 
effectively, from prevention to detection and treatment. 
Community-based Disaster Risk Management 
Yayasan PETRONAS collaborated with the National 
Disaster Management Association Malaysia (NADIM) to 
introduce Community-Based Disaster Risk Management 
(CBDRM) training to local communities in Tumpat, 
Kelantan and Pekan, Pahang. Seasonal floods impacted 
both areas for several years.
CBDRM aims to strengthen community resilience by 
enhancing their capabilities and skills in pre-disaster 
training provided to help communities prepare for 
disasters to minimise its impact on their assets and lives.
The training also allowed local emergency responders and 
agencies to forge stronger relationships.
 Equipped 200 participants, including community 
leaders with pre-disaster training.
Training for People with Disabilities
The Perlis Special Teens Centre (PeSTeC) under the 
management of the Perlis Special Children Community 
Rehabilitation Organisation upgraded its facilities as a 
result of a grant received from Yayasan PETRONAS in 
2022. This further supportd PeSTeC in helping special 
needs teenagers adapt to society by providing them with 
skills training and instilling a sense of independence.
Breaking the Cycle of Poverty Among Malaysia's 
Indigenous Communities and Extreme Poor
PETRONAS collaborates with a dedicated government 
department for the indigenous community (Orang Asli), 
Jabatan Kemajuan Orang Asli (JAKOA) and NGOs for a 
programme aiming to uplift the lives of Orang Asli across 
Malaysia. The programme focuses on providing access to 
clean energy, clean water and education.
In 2022, installing solar power systems under the 
programme impacted 156 Orang Asli homes across six 
villages. Each household benefitted from six hours of 
additional electricity and light per night, adding six hours 
of productivity which the community can spend on their 
daily routines such as domestic chores and other 
community activities. The installations have also reduced 
the community's energy expenses to approximately RM400 
per month for each home. They previously purchased 
diesel fuel generator sets for their power supply. 
As of 31 December 2022, more than 232,000 productivity 
hours were achieved from the installations and a savings 
of RM406,152.
The programme was expanded in 2022 to include access 
to clean water and learning programmes. The pilot 
solar-powered filtration systems were completed in 
Kampung Gakuyah in Bera, Pahang. Three units of the 
system provide clean water to 12 homes for each unit. 
Access to clean water protected the community from 
waterborne diseases, reducing their healthcare expenses 
and improved the mortality rate among children. It also 
increased the community's awareness of personal hygiene 
and healthy living. 
Meanwhile, a pilot learning programme was completed in 
Kampung Kepong in Bentong, Pahang. This programme is 
ready to be scaled-up further in in 2023.
 The programme was expanded in 2022 to include 
access to clean water and learning programmes.
Improving Youth Employability in Sabah
The Entrepreneurship Programme helps local 
entrepreneurs expand their business scale and find new 
market opportunities. The programme consisted of five 
training modules on ideation, conceptualisation, marketing 
strategy and business analysis which aims to equip 
participants with basic entrepreneurial skills. Agrobank 
provided information on financial management.
Working closely with the Giatmara Training Programme, 
we aim to upskill local youth and improve their 
employability. Youths from Lawas and Baram were 
exposed to courses such as welding and metal fabrication, 
automotive technology and building technology through 
the Towards Uplifting Lives Programme (TULiP).
 22 participants from Lawas completed the 
Entrepreneurship Programme. 
 10 local youths graduated from the Giatmara 
Training Programme.

MyLady Assistance Scheme
Yayasan PETRONAS supported the MyLady Assistance 
Scheme programme to empower single mothers and 
women living with HIV to get out of poverty. Through this 
scheme, these women were given access to microcredit 
business loans, entrepreneurial training and peer support, 
to assist them with their home-based enterprises.
 30 single mothers and women living with HIV received 
assistance through the MyLady Assistance Scheme. 
SAGA Health Access Programme (SHAPE)
Through the Malaysia Aids Foundation (MAF) SAGA Health 
Access Programme (SHAPE), Yayasan PETRONAS assisted 
B40 patients with HIV, Thalassemia and Paediatric illness 
from rural Sabah to attend their treatment appointments 
by subsidising the high logistical costs to local hospitals or 
clinics.
 Contributed RM2.5 million to MERCY Malaysia for 
flood relief assistance in Pakistan. 
 Delivered 5,000 care packages worth close to RM1 
million through Yayasan PETRONAS to flood prone 
districts in Malaysia.
SEEd.Lab Social Enterprise Programme
Through our end-to-end incubator programme, Social 
Enterprise Education Lab (SEEd.Lab), in partnership with 
Tata Consultancy Services, we tackle social pain points by 
building self-sustaining social enterprises that forge 
solutions for specific beneficiaries within communities. For 
the second cohort, our social enterprises address specific 
social challenges that exist within five domains namely 
Food and Agriculture, Health and Hygiene, Education and 
Skills, Personal and Financial Security; and Entrepreneurship 
in Sabah. The first of its kind in comprehensiveness in 
Malaysia, SEEd.Lab has enriched the lives of over 13,000 
people and counting. 
Yayasan PETRONAS’ festive programme 
 Provided more than 11,800 families and nine 
welfare homes with essential food supplies and 
festive hampers via Yayasan PETRONAS’ festive 
programme during major festive celebrations.
Yayasan PETRONAS’ Homeward programme
 Donated home medical equipment worth RM2.2 
million to 965 beneficiaries under the Homeward 
programme by Yayasan PETRONAS, working with 
Jabatan Kebajikan Masyarakat (JKM) and Jabatan 
Perkhidmatan Kebajikan Am Sabah (JPKAS). The 
beneficiaries from 13 states and two federal 
territories (except Putrajaya) received 609 hospital 
beds, 44 oxygen concentrators and 312 wheelchairs.
MERCY Malaysia 
We are committed to doing our part in assisting those in 
need. We contributed to MERCY Malaysia to support its 
flood relief efforts in Pakistan and offered aid through

Helping fishermen
 We uplift the lives of the fishermen community in 
Sabah, Sarawak and Terengganu with programmes 
tailored to their needs. These include safety 
awareness, educational activities focusing on the 
environment and contributing essential supplies 
and life jackets. 
 The engagements, awareness sessions and 
outreach programmes have enhanced the 
community’s safety awareness. This is reflected in 
a 60 per cent reduction in oil rig encroachments 
and zero fish bombing activities.
 Additionally, the disposal of seized boats and the 
contribution of unjam, a traditional fish aggregating 
device, created fish breeding grounds for marine 
ecosystems to thrive and provided alternative 
fishing spots for the community
Sea Turtle Conservation in Mexico
We contributed to conservation efforts by building a larger 
and more protected nesting area for endangered sea 
turtles, increasing hatching rates by 30 per cent since 
2020. In addition, we enhanced workers’ living conditions, 
boosting morale and performance, and provided a safer, 
more efficient warehouse for equipment and materials 
storage.
Student Voices
The Student Voices competition provides a platform for 
future generations to share their ideas and solutions for 
some of the world’s biggest challenges. 
The competition aims to promote environmental 
protection, stronger communities and social responsibility 
by inspiring young contestants with educational videos on 
green mobility, solar energy and hydrogen. Our goal is to 
empower these students to become the voice for change. 
In 2022, the competition saw the participation of 500 
contestants from 26 schools in both online and onsite 
events. Since 2020, we have impacted over 200,000 
beneficiaries, primarily teenagers and their families, in 
Shanghai and surrounding cities.
Clean water
 PETRONAS is positively impacting local 
communities in South Sudan, Sudan, Iraq and 
Indonesia by providing access to clean water. As a 
result, business and farming in South Sudan and 
Sudan have improved health and economic 
opportunities. 
 PETRONAS also contributed water filters in Iraq 
and implemented a clean water programme in 
Indonesian schools, improving students’ education 
and hygiene awareness.

Environment – PETRONAS Planting Tomorrow 
We recognise that achieving environmental awareness is a 
continuous journey that requires collective action. 
Therefore, we constantly work with our local communities 
to support environmental conservation and minimise our 
impact on the environment. 
Environmental Conservation 
Through Yayasan PETRONAS, we contributed towards 
carbon sequestration via tree planting activities. We did 
this by working with local communities in 11 states 
namely Kedah, Penang, Perak, Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, 
Melaka, Johor, Terengganu, Pahang, Sabah and Sarawak, 
where we provided them with the appropriate education, 
supported the setting-up of nurseries, participated in 
planting activities and monitored the survival of the trees. 
These actions help in improving the community’s income 
levels and quality of life.
 Continued to support environmental conservation 
under the PETRONAS Walk4Trees Challenge, a 
nationwide tree-planting project. A total of 61,584 
trees have been planted across 11 states since this 
project began in September 2020. 
 Three peat swamp forests in Selangor, Sabah and 
Pahang were rehabilitated and irrigation control 
management was implemented as part of fire 
prevention.
 
We conducted the mangrove conservation programmme 
in Johor and Terengganu. In Johor, it was carried out in 
support of the Johor State Government’s plan to develop 
Sungai Johor Estuary into an ecotourism attraction by 
planting 14,500 mangrove trees. In Terengganu, this was 
part of PCG’s conservation and rehabilitation awareness 
programme along Sungai Kertih. The programme covers 
more than 14,000 square metres, with over 20,000 
mangrove trees planted. 
Biodiversity efforts:
 We are also doing various conservation efforts to prevent and minimise impacts to 
biodiversity and the ecosystem, while restoring and rehabilitating the ecosystems 
surrounding where we operate.
 
Our Upstream business planted over 15,000 trees, including mangroves, converted shipwrecks 
into artificial reefs, conducted coral restoration works and deployed mini unjam, a fish aggregating 
device, to provide alternative breeding grounds for marine life, especially fish. These efforts 
helped improve the marine ecosystem services to ensure food security, sustainable economic 
and coastal livelihood development (ecotourism) and shoreline protection.
Beach Cleaning Activities
We collaborated with several Non-Governmental 
Organisations (NGOs) and government ministries to 
clean up beaches. In Melaka, as part of our participation 
in World Clean-Up Day, we partnered with Solid Waste 
and Public Cleansing Management Corporation 
(SWCorp), the city council, Majlis Bandaraya Melaka 
Bersejarah (MBMB), and the state’s legislative assembly 
development and coordination committee, Jawatankuasa 
Pembangunan dan Penyelarasan Dewan Undangan 
Negeri (JAPERUN). 
The collaborative effort saw 100.2 kilogrammes of waste 
collected. In Terengganu, we collaborated with a local 
NGO, Geng Plastik Ija and the state’s Department of 
Statistics Malaysia branch to collect 1,897 kilogrammes of 
waste, with 844 kilogrammes of recyclable waste 
materials.

GHG Emissions – Operational Control
GHG Emissions – Operational Control
Total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Breakdown by Business (Million tCO2e)
GHG Emissions Breakdown by Region (Million tCO2e)
(Excludes Corporate and Others)
In reviewing and improving our GHG emissions accounting methods, the total GHG emissions for operational control 
changed from previous disclosures due to the change of organisational boundary during re-baselining activities 
conducted in FY2022. Changes in scope since 2021 disclosures cover the inclusion of VESTIGO* and Iraq operations 
and removal of Myanmar because of divestment.
Our emissions in 2022 were higher compared to 2021 due to increased operational activities along the value chain 
following recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The short-term target of capping GHG emissions at 49.5 Million tCO2e by 2024, includes the oil and gas value chain 
where more than 90 per cent of GHG emissions are contributed by activities in Upstream, Gas and Downstream 
Malaysia operations excluding Corporate and Others** activities. Furthermore, GHG emissions accounting for Corporate 
and Others require further refinements due to different organisational boundary used previously. Hence, subsequent 
analysis depicted below exclude Corporate and Others.
GHG Emissions Breakdown by Scope, Gases and Sources for Operational Control
(Excludes Corporate and Others)
In FY2022, total GHG emissions from Scope 1 and Scope 2 for Malaysia and International assets under operational 
control boundary is 49.58 Million tCO2e.
In the oil and gas value chain, GHG emissions from Gas business contributed 46 per cent, followed by 28 per cent 
from Upstream and 26 per cent from Downstream. 96 per cent of emissions were from Scope 1 where the sources 
were mainly from stationary combustion, flaring and venting. Meanwhile Scope 2 only contributed to 4 per cent of 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
GHG emissions from Malaysia operations have been showing positive improvements, as it remained below the cap of 
49.5 Million tCO2e. This was contributed by ongoing investment in GHG emissions reduction efforts from FY2019 to 
FY2022 despite economic downturn. For international operations, total GHG emissions from Scope 1 and Scope 2 
increased in FY2022 due to the increase in production from Iraq and Canada operations.

GHG Emissions Reduction from Projects (Million tCO2e/year)
GHG emissions reduction are calculated as per ISO 14064-2: 2019 and do not reflect the year-on-year GHG emissions differences. According 
to ISO 14064-2, GHG projects are activities that alter the conditions of a GHG baseline and which cause GHG emissions reduction or GHG 
removal enhancements.
Cumulatively since 2013, we have reduced 18.1 Million tCO2e of GHG emissions from our operations. Over the years, 
GHG emissions reduction was achieved through flaring and venting reduction initiatives in Upstream as well as energy 
efficiency improvements in Gas and Downstream businesses. Moving forward, electrification and CCS efforts will 
contribute more to meet our short-term and mid-term targets.

Equity share reflects economic interest, which is the extent of rights a company has to the risks and rewards flowing 
from an operation. Hence, PETRONAS has set mid-term and long-term targets by referring to FY2019 as the base year 
on equity share approach. The GHG emissions for FY2019 is adjusted to be 54.87 Million tCO2e taking into 
consideration divestments and changes of equity ownership in Upstream business, as well as new information obtained 
from equity partners in Gas and Downstream businesses. In 2022, Gas business contributed the highest GHG emissions 
(37.50 per cent), followed by Upstream business (36.87 per cent), Downstream business (21.03 per cent), and Corporate 
and Others (4.60 per cent).

Commitment to Governance

Board Governance and Structure
PETRONAS has resolutely demonstrated a progressive and resilient performance despite the challenging global 
business environment. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant economic contraction, putting corporate 
governance practices of organisations worldwide to the test. PETRONAS, has remained resilient in its commitment to 
apply the best corporate governance principles across the Group.
Corporate governance plays a crucial role in promoting sustainability by providing the necessary framework for 
accountability, transparency and structure within the Group. In building a sustainable business, the Board is fully aware 
of its responsibility towards its shareholders and stakeholders. The Board firmly upholds effective leadership and 
unwavering ethical standards by providing the framework which serves as a basis for sustainable decision-making.
PETRONAS is led by a Board whose Directors are collectively responsible for creating and delivering long-term 
sustainable value for the business. A key responsibility of the Board is to balance the interests of the Group and our 
stakeholders including employees and the wider communities we serve. Our governance structure ensures role clarity 
by clearly delineating roles and areas of accountability and recognises the independent roles and duties required to 
effectively govern the Company. The governance structure aims to promote strategic alignment across the Group whilst 
facilitating efficient decision-making at all levels.
Corporate Governance at PETRONAS
Board Leadership
The Board provides effective stewardship and is responsible 
for the Group’s strategic direction and control of the 
Company. The Board exercises this control by way of a 
governance framework, effective delegation, risk 
management and a system of assurances regarding 
financial reporting and internal controls. The Board is 
accountable to its shareholders and towards a wider range 
of stakeholders such as employees, suppliers, community 
and the authorities.
Each Director has the duty to act in good faith and in the 
best interest of the Company. In discharging its roles and 
duties effectively, the Board is guided by the Board 
Charter, a document which sets out the authority, 
responsibilities and operations of the Board. 
The differing roles of the Chairman and the President and 
GCEO are acknowledged and provided for in the Board 
Charter. The Chairman of the Board is not a member of 
any of the Board Committees.
The Board exercises collective oversight at all times. In 
delegating its authority to the Board Committees, the 
Board does not abdicate its responsibilities. The Board 
further ensures that such delegation does not hinder or 
reduce the Board’s ability to discharge its functions. In this 
regard, the Board clearly sets out the division of 
responsibilities in the respective Terms of Reference (TOR) 
of the Board Committees.
Together with Management, the Board upholds good 
corporate governance culture within the Company by 
ensuring ethical leadership, prudence and professional 
behaviour in the conduct of its business and in all aspects 
of its operations.
How the Board Functions
The Board meets regularly, and additional meetings are 
arranged as and when circumstances dictate. Each meeting 
is conducted in accordance with a formal and structured 
agenda and Board papers are circulated on time to ensure 
that Directors are well-informed and that debates and 
decisions are constructive and robust. 
Access to Board papers by the Board members is carried 
out online through a collaborative software, with the aim 
of enhancing the efficiency of the Board process. Going 
digital allows the Directors to access, read and review the 
Board papers, as well as enables the Board members to 
confer with each other and with the Company Secretaries, 
electronically. Board Papers and presentations by the 
Management to the Board are prepared and delivered in a 
manner that ensures clarity and provide sufficient 
understanding of the subject matter.
In 2022, the Board met on 23 occasions of which almost 
all meetings were conducted physically. Although the 
quorum for the Board meeting is two, majority of the 
Board meetings were attended by all Directors.
Each Director has full access to the services of the 
Company Secretaries, who play an advisory role to the 
Board by providing guidance on corporate governance, 
ethical business practices, compliance to the Company’s 
Constitution, policies and procedures and the relevant 
regulatory requirements, guidelines and legislation. 
The Board may from time to time and if deemed 
appropriate, consider and approve urgent matters via 
Directors’ circular resolution. All circular resolutions passed 
by the Board are tabled at the next Board meeting for 
notation. 
The Board practises active and open discussions at its 
meetings so as to ensure that opportunities are given to 
all Directors to participate and contribute to the decision-
making process. Robust discussions and vigorous 
deliberations at the Board meetings ensure that the 
process of effective and healthy dialogue is achieved.
The respective Chairmen of the Audit Committee, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee and Risk 
Committee provide regular updates to the Board 
subsequent to the proceedings of their respective 
Committee meetings.
All proceedings of Board meetings are duly minuted, 
confirmed and signed. Minutes of each Board meeting 
accurately reflect the deliberations and decisions of the 
Board, including any dissenting views and if any Director 
had abstained from voting or deliberating on a particular 
matter. Minutes of the Board meetings are properly kept 
by the Company Secretary.
Matters Reserved for the Board
The Board has an approved and documented schedule 
of matters reserved for its decision as follows:
1. 
Strategy and Management – Strategy, policies, 
annual budgets and major investment decisions 
which include capital projects, mergers and 
acquisitions and funding requirements.
2. 
Financial, Governance and Risk – Financial 
reporting and control, and risk management.
3. 
Corporate Matters – Reputation and stakeholder 
management, Health, Safety, Security and 
Environment (HSSE), Board and Board Committees’ 
memberships, Directors’ remuneration and

critical risks. Key risk indicators which provide early warnings of risk 
manifestation were also reported to the Board.
To ensure risks undertaken in pursuit of business objectives are within 
Board acceptable level, the Board approved the Company’s risk 
appetite which sets its key operational boundaries. Any breach of risk 
appetite may jeopardise the Company’s business sustainability, hence, 
will be escalated to the Board for deliberation.
In achieving comprehensive risk-based decision making, the Board also 
deliberated on the risks related to high impact business matters such 
as Final Investment Decisions of projects in order to assess the 
feasibility and commerciality of these projects and investments.

Board Strategic Conversation Series
In addition to the above meetings, the PETRONAS Board Strategic Conversation (BSC) Series are held periodically as 
part of the initiative to achieve a high performing Board. The BSC Series, which include Sustainability Series are 
conducted in-house or by external subject matter experts. 
It aims to provide updates and discussions on sustainability and market outlook. It also includes the deliberations on the 
Group’s strategic and growth plans for the purposes of enriching the Directors’ knowledge and for the Directors to 
keep abreast with the latest trends and development.
Board Balance and Effectiveness
Fit and Proper Policy
In September 2022, the Board had approved the 
establishment of the Directors’ Fit and Proper Policy (the 
Policy) as an enhancement of the existing PETRONAS 
Board Selection Criteria. The Policy aims to ensure that 
any person to be appointed or elected/re-elected as a 
Director of the PETRONAS Group shall possess the 
character, integrity, experience, competence, commitment 
to contribute in discharging his or her responsibilities 
required of the appointment in the most effective manner. 
Diversity
The Board recognises the importance of diversity and the 
value it brings to the PETRONAS Group. Diversity 
promotes the inclusion of different perspectives, raising 
the standards of good practice in Board leadership and 
enhancement of valuable insights in business judgment. 
Diversity is also important to ensure the Company 
remains relevant, resilient and sustainable in the rapidly 
transforming and evolving business environment.
Whilst it is important to promote diversity, the normal 
selection criteria of a Director based on an effective blend 
of competencies, skills, experience and knowledge in 
areas identified by the Board remains a priority so as not 
to compromise the effectiveness in carrying out the 
Board’s functions and duties. The Board is committed to 
ensure that its composition not only reflects diversity but 
will also have the right mix of skills and balance to 
contribute to the achievement of the Company’s goals 
and objectives.
Board Balance and Composition
As at the date of this report, the Board of Directors of 
PETRONAS comprises nine members; the Non-Executive 
Chairman, two Executive Directors and six Non-Executive 
Directors (NEDs), out of which four are Independent  
Non-Executive Directors (INEDs). The biographical details 
of the Directors are set out on page 259.
The size and composition of the Board is fundamental to 
its success in providing strong and effective leadership. 
The presence of Non-Executive Directors ensures that no 
individual or small group of Directors are able to dominate 
the decision-making process and that the interests of 
shareholders and stakeholders are protected. 
During the year under review, the Board saw some 
changes and new appointments to its composition.
In view of the retirement of Puan Zakiah Jaafar effective 
22 April 2022, Datuk Seri Asri Hamidin @ Hamidon and his 
alternate, Datuk Johan Mahmood Merican, were appointed 
to the Board of PETRONAS on 28 April 2022. Datuk Seri 
Asri Hamidin @ Hamidon and Datuk Johan Mahmood 
Merican had, however, resigned on 5 January 2023.
The Board wishes to record its appreciation and gratitude 
to Puan Zakiah Jaafar, Datuk Seri Asri Hamidin @ 
Hamidon and Datuk Johan Mahmood Merican for their 
contribution and commitment during their tenure on the 
Board.
The Board also welcomed Datuk KY Mustafa as a NINED 
on the PETRONAS Board effective 19 January 2022.
The current composition of the Board has a blend of 
skills, experience and knowledge which enables them to 
provide effective oversight, strategic guidance and 
constructive challenge, review and deliberation on the 
Management’s proposals. The NRC is responsible for 
reviewing the composition of the Board and assessing 
whether the balance of skills, experience, knowledge and 
independence is appropriate to enable the Board to 
perform effectively as a high performing Board.

Corporate Governance at PETRONAS


Board Independence
The Board assesses the independence of its NEDs annually. The independence assessment takes into account whether 
the NEDs have demonstrated an independent state of mind and objective judgment in their deliberations and decision-
making process. The assessment on the independence of the NEDs may be undertaken in the following circumstances:
1  Prior to the Appointment of 
Non-Executive Directors
2 Annual Review
3 Notice of Change of Circumstances
Prior to the appointment of NEDs, the 
independence of each individual candidate 
will be reviewed and determined by the 
Board based on the recommendations 
from the NRC upon reviewing his/her 
criteria per the PETRONAS Independent 
Directors Guidelines.
The Board determines the independence 
of each NED annually, based on the 
recommendations from the NRC per the 
PETRONAS Independent Directors 
Guidelines.
Each NED has an affirmative obligation to 
notify the NRC of any change in 
circumstances that may affect his/her 
independence status. Once notified, the 
NRC shall re-evaluate the independence 
status and make the necessary 
recommendations to the Board.
The INEDs have been appointed for their specific experience and expertise and are independent of management and 
free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent 
judgement. NEDs may serve on the boards of other companies provided this does not involve a conflict of interest and 
that the appointment does not restrict their ability to discharge their duties to PETRONAS in any way.
In line with the exemplary practices of corporate governance, the Board has adopted a tenure policy whereby an 
INED’s total tenure on the Board is capped at nine years. As at the date of this Statement, none of the INEDs has 
served the Board for more than nine years.
Conflict of Interest
In ensuring transparency and integrity of the decision-making process as well as to prevent any conflict of interest, a 
declaration of interest by Directors is a fixed agenda item at the start of every Board meeting. A Director who has direct 
or indirect interest in a transaction shall recuse himself/herself when required and abstain from deliberations and voting to 
allow unbiased and free discussions and decision-making. Disclosure of the nature and extent of the Directors’ interest 
and abstention from decision making proceedings are recorded in the minutes of the Board meetings. The Principles of 
Directorship for the PETRONAS Group was established to govern the way Directors conduct themselves in a conflict-of-
interest situation, which corresponds with the Companies Act 2016 and the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics (CoBE) 
of the Company. 
The Directors are also required to declare their interests annually, in line with the requirements on the disclosure of 
Director’s interests in the Company’s Audited Financial Statements.
Board Remuneration Policy
Given the highly competitive market, PETRONAS designed a robust fee structure to attract, retain and appropriately 
compensate the diverse and internationally experienced NEDs. The fee framework is illustrated below:

Board Onboarding and Professional Development Programme
The Board recognises the importance of ensuring that new Directors have a complete introduction to the business so 
that they are able to make a full and meaningful contribution to the Board. To that end, the Board has adopted a 
comprehensive and extensive onboarding programme for new Directors, including meetings with key senior leadership 
as teams, bespoke training on relevant regulatory and legal obligations and onboard procedures and processes. 
Directors have full access to roundtable discussions, seminars and other events, covering topics relevant to the Group 
and their roles. The Company provides Directors with the necessary resources to update their knowledge and 
capabilities throughout the year.
A suite of development programmes, known as the PETRONAS Board Excellence, tailor-made to the requirements of 
Directors across the Group, has been in place since 2016 to chart the Directors’ development plans in a structured 
manner.

*  The Foundational programmes only apply to the directors who are employees of the PETRONAS Group, thus, the PETRONAS Directors, 
upon their onboarding, will attend the Advanced programmes of the PBE.
The PETRONAS PBE programme is developed upon the 
occurrence of new concern for the Directors’ awareness 
and knowledge that may involve the Directors’ roles and 
responsibilities. Moving forward, sustainability has been 
identified for inclusion in the PBE programme, which will 
be carried out in 2023. In this instance the programme is 
intended to create awareness among the directors on the 
importance of sustainability and the accountabilities of 
Directors as part of the Environmental, Social and 
Governance requirements.
Qualified and Competent Company Secretaries
The Company Secretaries of PETRONAS are qualified to act 
as company secretary by virtue of Section 235 of the CA 
2016. Both of the Company Secretaries are legally qualified. 
They act as advisors to the Board, particularly with regard 
to the PETRONAS’ Constitution, policies and procedures 
and its compliance with regulatory requirements, codes, 
guidelines and legislations.
The Company Secretaries act as an important link 
between the Board and the Management. Through 
effective communication, they provide the Management 
with the understanding on the expectations of, and value 
brought by the Board.
 
The Company Secretaries ensure that discussions and 
deliberations at the Board and Board Committee meetings 
are well documented, and subsequently communicated to 
the Management for appropriate actions. The Company 
Secretaries update the Board on the follow-up of its 
decisions and recommendations. The Board is satisfied 
with the performance and support rendered by the 
Company Secretaries to the Board in discharging their 
functions in the financial year under review.
The Company Secretaries also constantly keep themselves 
abreast of the evolving regulatory changes and developments 
in corporate governance through continuous training. 
Board Evaluation
The Board, through the NRC, endeavours to conduct 
annual performance evaluation of the Board and its 
Committees, facilitated by the Company Secretary. 
Evaluation results are reported to the NRC. Individual 
Director’s evaluation results are made available to the 
NRC Chairman and reported directly to the Chairman of 
the Board. The Chairman of the Board will then conduct 
feedback sessions through peer-to-peer meetings.

Corporate Governance at PETRONAS


During the year under review, the NRC had engaged an 
independent third-party consultant to conduct the Board 
Effectiveness Evaluation (BEE). The process of the BEE 
involved a set of questionnaires consisting of evaluations 
by the Board, Board Committee and Self-Assessment 
which were developed to maximise the effectiveness and 
performance of the Board in the best interests of 
PETRONAS. The indicators for the performance of the 
Board include, among others, the Board composition, 
planning process, conduct, communication with the 
Management and stakeholders, as well as strategy and 
planning for the Company. The consultant thereafter 
performed an independent assessment on the findings 
and areas of improvement and presented to the NRC for 
its consideration.
The NRC reviewed the outcome of the 2022 BEE 
whereby the findings of the BEE indicated that the Board 
is committed to the highest standards of good 
governance and affirmed the effectiveness of the Board. 
Directors’ Indemnity 
PETRONAS continues to provide and maintain 
indemnification for its Directors throughout the financial 
year as allowed under the CA 2016 to the extent it is 
insurable under the Directors’ and Officers’ Liability 
Insurance (D&O) procured by the Company. Directors and 
Officers are indemnified against any liability incurred by 
them in discharging their duties while holding office as 
Directors and Officers of the Company. All Directors may 
opt to obtain D&O insurance to provide insurance 
protection (to the extent it is insurable) against 
unindemnified liabilities by the Company or uninsured 
circumstances. The premium to be paid by all Directors is 
determined by the insurance company.
Succession Planning 
The Board Succession Planning Framework had been 
adopted by the Board to assist the Company in ensuring 
a structured and timely identification and selection of new 
Non-Executive Directors in the event of an opening on 
the Board, whether such opening exists by reason of an 
anticipated retirement, the expansion of the size of the 
Board, or otherwise. Such structured succession plan 
addresses the composition and effectiveness of the Board. 
The Board, through the NRC, has the responsibility in 
ensuring appropriate succession planning of Directors and 
reviewing the Board’s required mix of skills and 
experience, as well as reviewing the tenure of INEDs on 
the Board.
In addition to succession planning for the Directors, the 
NRC also reviewed the succession plan of key management 
positions of the Company. The NRC continued to focus 
on conducting all relevant reviews and assessments of key 
management positions. 
Board Commitment to Sustainability
The Board acknowledges that the well-being of the 
employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders as 
well as the environment and the society at large is central 
to sustaining our long-term performance and continued 
relevance. Careful consideration of the needs of a broader 
universe of stakeholders ultimately drives value for the 
shareholders.
The heightened materiality of sustainability to the business 
requires the Board to factor in these sustainability 
components, risks and opportunities into its deliberations 
at all times. The Board, being the highest authority in 
sustainability governance, has taken the initiative in the 
establishment of the Company’s approach to sustainability 
and road map. During the year under review, the Board’s 
engagement and oversight of sustainability related matters 
were broadened.
Board’s Oversight of Climate-Related Risks and 
Opportunities
The Board recognises that climate is a critical business 
issue, contributing to a set of risks and opportunities. The 
Board is taking more deliberate actions in elevating 
sustainability, especially climate-related discussions to 
shape the long-term strategic direction of the company. 
Key oversight by the Board on climate-related risks and 
opportunities in 2022 are as follows:
• Endorsement by the RC on the PETRONAS Corporate 
Risk Profile considering climate-related risk and its 
mitigation on quarterly basis for Board’s approval.
• Approval of Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 
Pathway and alignment to the annual business plan and 
budget cycle.
• Approval of Nature and Biodiversity Position in support 
of the Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050 Pathway.
• Approval of Nature-based Climate Solutions strategy.
• Approval of climate-related matrix as part of the 
long-term incentive plan for senior leadership. In 2022, 
20 per cent of the long-term incentive plan consists of 
ESG elements and this includes measurement of net 
carbon intensity as well as diversity and inclusion.
• Approved the formation of Gentari Sdn Bhd, an 
independent entity focused on providing clean energy 
solutions.
• Quarterly conversation series with global sustainability 
experts, with a dedicated session on climate change 
that includes Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosure (TCFD), human rights and just transition.

proposals that are significant from the risk perspective as 
well as monitors the activities on integrity-related 
initiatives for the PETRONAS Group. 
Compliance
Tone from the Top
The compliance culture in PETRONAS is championed by the “tone from the top”, driven by the principles of PETRONAS 
Cultural Beliefs and Shared Values. The continuous messaging from the PETRONAS Board of Directors and PETRONAS 
Executive Leadership Team sets the values for the expected conduct and ethics. It shapes the behaviour and attitude of 
PETRONAS employees at all levels of businesses and activities across the PETRONAS Group.
Operationalising Compliance from the Ground
As PETRONAS operates in multiple jurisdictions worldwide, the Compliance Management Operations (CMO) team is 
structured to ensure compliance with domestic and global requirements by establishing offices at the PETRONAS 
headquarters in Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC), as well as regional offices in Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East 
and the Americas. The regional compliance management offices support PETRONAS’ compliance position by 
implementing adequate and effective controls, conducting compliance programmes and activities, and developing 
localised content in line with local laws and requirements. They achieve this through a risk-based approach and 
constant engagement with the headquarters while also ensuring alignment with PETRONAS’ compliance practices.
In ensuring compliance management operations are comprehensive and up-to-date, the Subject Matter Expert (SME) 
team would keep abreast with updated regulations, laws and enforcements guidance from all over the globe, as well as 
develop compliance policies, processes and procedures for PETRONAS businesses and activities. Additionally, the SME 
team would provide specialist legal advice, steer the strategic direction of PETRONAS business, and set up PETRONAS 
group positions.
The RC discharges its responsibilities through its 
scheduled meetings during the year in accordance with 
its fixed agenda which covers the matters under the 
purview of the RC. The RC met eight times in 2022.

Similarly, for effective and efficient management of the compliance programmes and activities, the Compliance Strategy 
and Planning (CSP) team would develop and plan the PETRONAS’ corporate compliance strategy and programmes, as well

Together, the three teams form the Legal Compliance department of Group Legal, which delivers comprehensive and 
integrated legal compliance programmes and activities for PETRONAS, with the ultimate aim of protecting and 
safeguarding PETRONAS Group of Companies against any breaches of laws.
Digitalising Compliance
A digital solution called myCompliance, has been developed and deployed across PETRONAS Group of Companies for 
efficient and effective monitoring of legal and regulatory compliance. This digital compliance platform simplifies 
compliance management operations and has been linked with other relevant systems including myLearningX (on 
eLearning Modules), myASSURANCE (on Assurance programme) and myGOVERNANCE (on policies repository) to ensure 
the data is reliable, up-to-date and accurate.
The following are the five modules that have been deployed as part of myCompliance digital solutions:
a) Compliance Tracker – Tracking and analysis of compliance assurance programme.
b) Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) – Digitalisation of TPRM programme.
c) Training Tracker – Tracking the completion of mandatory compliance trainings.
d) Policy Management – Centralised policy development process and repository. 
e) Regulation Tracker – Centralised repository of laws.
The myCompliance digital solution reduces PETRONAS’ risk to potential threats such as incurring financial and non-
financial penalties, loss of business opportunities, and severe reputational impact on the enterprise. This is achieved 
through improved oversight and ease of operations, both directly and indirectly.
Focus Areas
PETRONAS focuses on Critical Legal Areas (CLAs) and Operational Legal Areas (OLAs) through a robust compliance 
programme as encapsulated in its Legal Compliance Framework (LCF), the overarching framework on ensuring compliance 
with laws and regulations that PETRONAS has identified. 
The CLAs are laws with extra-territorial effect. Any breach of the law could result in significant civil and criminal 
penalties, legal suits and severe reputational impact, which may pose enterprise risks to PETRONAS. The OLAs are 
operational laws that relate to business activities and operations, where any breach poses threats to the continuous 
operations of the business, including the loss of the license to operate.

The compliance programme and controls for CLAs have stabilised and matured since its establishment in 2018. Throughout 
this long journey, the focus is now on gap improvement and full compliance by PETRONAS Group of Companies with 
the requirements of laws under the CLAs. On the other hand, the compliance programme and controls for the OLAs 
are still in the development stage, as it was only established recently in May 2022.
The controls embedded by LCF are grouped into 5 Key Compliance Areas (5 KCAs) – an essential tool in strengthening 
and monitoring the compliance culture in PETRONAS. The status of controls under each of the 5 KCAs are reported on 
a quarterly basis to the top management of Group Legal and Group Risk Management via the Corporate Risk Profile/
Risk Appetite report, as well as escalated (where necessary) to PETRONAS Risk Committee (RC) and PETRONAS Board 
of Directors (Board). This ensures the top management is made aware of the progress of the implementation of Legal 
Compliance Control (LCC) across the PETRONAS Group of Companies.

PETRONAS establishes various governance documents, including policies, standards, guidelines, frameworks and 
manuals, as the foundation for internal controls to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. In FY2022, new 
governance documents were developed, and existing governance documents were enhanced for relevancy to current 
requirements. These governance documents are required to be adopted and implemented by PETRONAS Group of 
Companies.

PETRONAS Group of Companies is also exposed to potential hazards and risks that may substantially impact its 
operations and activities. The Company establishes several risk assessments that could identify these potential threats to 
manage and mitigate potential legal and regulatory non-compliance.

PETRONAS continues to deliver enterprise-wide training and awareness programmes via digital platforms (i.e. eLearning 
Modules) and customised engagements through its compliance management officers to instil awareness among 
PETRONAS staff and directors towards compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. 
In 2022, more than 36,000 employees across PETRONAS Group of Companies have completed the mandatory 
compliance eLearning Modules. On top of the eLearning Modules, 256 additional focused training and engagement 
sessions were conducted in FY2022 for PETRONAS Group of Companies, with more than 17,000 participants benefitting 
from these customised sessions.

Given the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, online courses, webinars and virtual training dominated the first half of 
FY2022. Physical engagements started to increase in the second half of FY2022 as Malaysia entered the endemic stage 
in quarter two of FY2022. In total, 89 per cent of training and engagement sessions were conducted virtually, and 11 
per cent were completed physically (six per cent) or in hybrid mode (five per cent).
As PETRONAS Group of Companies deals with various third parties, including partners, contractors, vendors, suppliers, 
distributors and agents, the Company manages its third-party risks through its Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) 
framework. TPRM is a robust due diligence process to safeguard PETRONAS from any exposure to the breaches of the 
CLAs especially from any corporate liability due to any misconduct from third parties.
The TPRM enables PETRONAS to detect possible threats before any formal engagement or during the business 
relationship with third parties. It would also allow for mitigation or contractual safeguard against legal, financial or 
reputational damage risks. The TPRM applies to all businesses and needs to be embedded by PETRONAS Group of 
Companies.
TPRM documents and tools have been developed to guide the implementation of the TPRM process and for PETRONAS 
Group of Companies to embed and apply across all businesses and needs.

PETRONAS reviews its business practices and activities regularly and ensures these practices are updated and aligned 
with legal and regulatory compliance. It has also put pre-emptive measures that PETRONAS Entities must embed and 
implement to ensure that PETRONAS Group of Companies adopt the best business practices and activities.
Below are some examples of the pre-emptive measures:
1. Export Control Licensing;
2. Sanctions Licensing;
3. General Retention of Consent;
4. Retention of Personal Data;
5. Accuracy of Personal Data;
6. Employees’ Conflict of Interest Declaration;
7. Gift Declaration Form; and
8. Display of Privacy Notice.
PETRONAS verifies the adequacy and effectiveness of controls through rigorous monitoring and assurance activities. The 
control, oversight and monitoring of PETRONAS Group of Companies’ compliance towards CLAs are achieved through 
a structured annual compliance self-assessment under PETRONAS Integrated Assurance Programme. This has also been 
introduced to cover OLAs.
Group Legal (as one of PETRONAS’ Second Line Assurance Providers), along with Group Internal Audit (as one of 
PETRONAS’ Third Line Assurance Providers), effectively identify, evaluate and recommend an intervention to address 
potential non-compliances and unsound practices using PETRONAS’ Three Lines of Defence model. The results of the 
review or audit may lead to identification of new controls to be developed or existing controls to be enhanced to 
continuously improve the legal compliance posture of PETRONAS Group.
In 2022, PETRONAS completed three assurance programmes to ensure compliance with the requirements stipulated 
under Critical and Operational Laws.
1. First Line Assurance for Critical Legal Areas;
2. Second Line Assurance for Critical Legal Areas; and
3. First Line Assurance for Operational Legal Areas.
On an annual basis, the compliance status of PETRONAS Entities towards the establishment of Legal Compliance 
Controls will be reported to the management of the Entities, as well as the management of Group Legal. This ensures 
the top management is aware of any gaps in its control implementation and will strive to close the gap in the most 
practical and feasible way possible.
PETRONAS adopts zero tolerance for any form of bribery or corruption. The PETRONAS CoBE, 
PETRONAS Anti Bribery and Corruption Manual, and PETRONAS Whistleblowing Policy are in 
place to guide PETRONAS employees and third parties when dealing with potential or actual 
bribery and corruption situations or improper conduct in their day-to-day business activities.
PETRONAS has established an Integrity Governance Unit (IGU) or Group Integrity as per Arahan Perdana Menteri (PM) 
2018 (Prime Minister’s Directive of 2018) to perform the four (4) core functions, which are Complaint Management, 
Detection Verification, Integrity Strengthening and Governance. In support of Group Integrity, Integrity Focal Person 
(IFP)’s have been established to implement and report on Integrity Strengthening and Governance related matters.
In August 2022, PETRONAS’ Executive Leadership Team signed the “Ikrar Bebas Rasuah,” or Corruption-Free-Pledge to 
demonstrate Top-level commitment to the ‘TRUST’ principle of adequate procedure as one of the defences against 
Corporate Liability. The ‘TRUST’ principles are Top Level Commitment (T), Risk Assessment (R), Undertake control 
measures (U), Systematic review, monitoring and enforcement (S), Training and communication (T).
The PETRONAS Organisational Anti-Corruption Plan (OACP) 2022-2023 has been published with the aspiration of “Zero 
tolerance for corruption in the pursuit of a corruption-free organisation”. The OACP strategies focus on:
• Strengthening corporate governance on people and processes
• Increased confidence on the internal controls and improved business processes efficiency
• Holistic approach and pervasive communication on ethics and integrity
PETRONAS Holding Company Unit has been ISO 37001:2016 Anti Bribery Management System (ABMS) certified since 
November 2017. This demonstrates our commitment to managing any corruption-related (integrity-related) activities 
while adhering to all applicable laws and regulations.
Pursuant to the Corruption Risk Assessment, sensitive positions have been identified as one of the mitigations to 
manage the corruption risk. 
A significant increase in whistleblowing complaints indicates increased awareness of the channel and trust for people to 
report their concerns, serving as a preventive measure in managing integrity.
In collaboration with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Academy (MACA), PETRONAS continues to upskill our staff on 
integrity and governance through the Certified Integrity Officer (CeIO) programme.
Various integrity strengthening programmes are implemented on a regular basis across the group to raise awareness of 
integrity-related topics such as whistleblowing and corporate liability.

Segment Earnings
Businesses across the value chain took bold choices and displayed operational resilience to capture market uptrend, 
which resulted in a solid financial performance for the year 2022.
• The Group operated three core businesses in FY2022, namely Upstream, Gas and Downstream.
• Corporate and Others which complements our core businesses, comprising primarily the maritime and logistics 
segment; property segment and central treasury; project delivery and technology division as well as the renewables, 
hydrogen and green mobility businesses. 
Upstream
• During the year, Upstream business recorded a PAT of RM51.3 
billion as compared to RM34.5 billion in FY2021 primarily driven by 
higher revenue partially offset by higher taxation as well as product 
costs in line with higher prices.
• The increase in Upstream revenue was mainly attributable to 
higher average realised prices for crude oil and condensates and 
natural gas as well as higher natural gas sales volume.
• Total daily production average of 2,434 thousand barrels of oil 
equivalent (boe) per day in FY2022, increase from 2,275 thousand 
boe per day in FY2021 was mainly driven by overall improved 
demand for gas in Peninsular Malaysia coupled with realised 
opportunities and better performance from international operations.
[Further details on Upstream’s operational performance can be found on page 106]
Gas
• Gas business recorded a PAT of RM43.2 billion as compared to 
PAT of RM15.1 billion in FY2021 mainly contributed by higher 
revenue partially offset by higher product costs and taxation. 
• The revenue in FY2022 recorded an increase of 61 per cent 
against the previous year, contributed by higher demand from the 
power sector. PETRONAS has concluded 136 MMscfd of natural 
gas supply deals with new and existing customers from the 
non-power sector.

Group cost stood at RM280.7 billion, an increase 
against last year by RM78.7 billion, mainly due to 
higher product cost, cash payments and states sales 
tax in line with higher prices. Despite the increase in 
the Group’s total costs, PETRONAS recorded a lower 
Group Cost to Revenue ratio of 75 per cent in FY2022 
compared to 81 per cent in the previous year, 
demonstrating our effective cost management efforts.

Group Financial Results and Position


Downstream
• Downstream business also recorded a PAT of RM7.5 billion against 
PAT of RM3.0 billion in FY2021 following the improved refining 
and petrochemical margins.
• During the year, Downstream business recorded stable operations 
with OEE sustained at 85.9 per cent, on the back of strong asset 
reliability.
• Petroleum products sales volume was 260.7 million barrels, higher 
by 1.7 million barrels following increased trading activities. Crude 
oil sales volume was 114.3 million barrels, higher by 4.6 million 
barrels mainly due to higher marketing volume. Petrochemical 
products sales volume was 8.3 million tonnes, higher by 0.1 million 
tonnes.
[More information on Downstream’s operational performance is available on  
page 126]
Corporate and Others
• Corporate and Other businesses recorded a PAT of RM0.2 billion, 
as compared to FY2021’s Loss After Tax (LAT) of RM1.5 billion. 
• Higher PAT recorded mainly due to higher revenue and favourable 
impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by higher operating 
expenditure.
• MISC Berhad (MISC) and KLCC Property Holdings Berhad (KLCCP) 
were the two major contributors to this segment. MISC recorded a 
PAT of RM1.8 billion during the year, mainly from increased freight 
rates in the Petroleum and Product Shipping segment as well as 
the Marine and Heavy Engineering segment turned profitable 
during the year in tandem with higher revenue coupled with 
recovery of COVID-19 claims and reversal of cost provisions for 
both on-going and post sail-away projects. KLCCP’s PAT increased 
to RM0.9 billion as compared to RM0.5 billion in the same period 
last year mainly due to the higher revenue of 24.6 per cent to 
RM1.5 billion.

Segment Capital Investments
• Amidst the continued volatility of the energy market and 
the call for energy transition, we remain steadfast in 
strengthening our portfolio through strict capital discipline, 
ensuring sufficient allocation for our cash generators, 
investments in growth, and transformation towards a 
low-carbon future. Overall CAPEX spent during the year 
was RM50.1 billion, higher compared with RM30.4 billion 
in FY2021.
• We continue to strengthen our core business and pursue 
CAPEX in the energy transition. RM12.5 billion or 25 per 
cent of total CAPEX was spent on New business. This 
includes the successful acquisition of Perstorp Holding AB, 
a leading sustainability-driven global specialty chemicals 
company based in Sweden. Decarbonisation projects such 
as Kasawari Carbon Capture and Sequestration were 
undertaken during the year.
• Moving forward, more allocation of CAPEX is projected in 
scaling up investment in the core business, lowering 
emissions as well as investing in clean energy to future-
proof the Group’s portfolio.
Upstream
• CAPEX for Upstream business accounted for 47 per cent 
of the the Group’s total CAPEX with a total spending of 
RM23.7 billion, an increase of RM9.0 billion as compared 
to FY2021. Upstream’s CAPEX for FY2022 was 
predominantly spent on exploration, development and 
production activities aimed at sustaining and growing 
production in Malaysia and international operations. 
• About RM10.5 billion or 44 per cent of Upstream total 
CAPEX was spent domestically to intensify efforts to 
enhance the recovery rate of existing fields as well as the 
development of new fields. Among the key projects in 
Malaysia are Kasawari Gas Field Development, Integrated 
Bekok Oil, and Bayan Gas Phase 2.
• Meanwhile, a total of RM13.2 billion was allocated towards 
international portfolio investments, key countries include 
Brazil, Canada, Iraq and Argentina. The highlights of the 
investments include the acquisition of 21 per cent 
participating interests in the Sepia field in Brazil, one of 
the world’s most prolific basins.
Gas 
• Gas business accounted for 11 per cent of the Group’s 
total CAPEX and incurred a total spending of RM5.6 billion 
in FY2022.
• CAPEX for FY2022 were predominantly spent on 
international ventures particularly for LNG projects in 
Canada. 
• Domestic spending during the year remains comparable to 
FY2021. Moving forward, the approved Final Investment 
Decision (FID) for the Sabah nearshore LNG facility will 
increase future domestic CAPEX, while monetising gas 
resources in an optimised and and more environmentally 
conscious manner.
Downstream
• Downstream business’ CAPEX of RM16.3 billion during the 
year, accounted for 33 per cent of the Group’s overall 
CAPEX allocation.
• The spending made during the year was mainly related to 
the acquisition of Perstorp as well as other operational 
and growth projects. 
Corporate and Others
• CAPEX spent by businesses under Corporate and Others 
during the year of RM4.5 billion, was lower by RM0.3 billion 
as compared to FY2021 with MISC accounting for 78 per 
cent of the total spending.
• During the year, MISC’s significant investments were mainly 
from Dynamic Positioning Shuttle Tankers (DPST) and Very 
Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) amounting to RM1.2 billion.
CAPEX by Strategy
(RM billion)
As the momentum for the energy transition accelerates, the Three-Pronged Growth Strategy (3PGS) was further 
crystallised into the PETRONAS Energy Transition Strategy. PETRONAS remains steadfast in the journey towards Energy 
Transition, achieving our NZCE 2050 aspiration and step-out opportunities beyond the Group’s current core business. 
25 per cent of total CAPEX in FY2022 was spent on New Business.
Capital Investments by Business and Geographical Segment
Domestic CAPEX increased by 24 per cent compared to FY2021, contributing to the growth of the Malaysian oil and 
gas industry. 
Excluding international acquisitions made during the year, the CAPEX spent is divided almost equally between Malaysia 
and international projects.
Included in the Corporate and Others business segment is CAPEX incurred for Gentari.
