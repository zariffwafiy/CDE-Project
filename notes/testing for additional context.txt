testing for additional context

---
context 1
I am comparing the semantic similarity between a data attribute in a data dictionary and a data element in a data standard
iteration 1: score = 0.95
iteration 2: score = 0.95
iteration 3: score = 0.95

context 2
added definition:
definitions = (
    "Data Attribute - It is at the lowest level of data taxonomy in a data dictionary and received from clients/businesses.\n"
    "Data Dictionary - It is a collection of data attributes.\n"
    "Data Element - It is at the lowest level of data taxonomy in a data standard and .\n"
    "Data Standard - It is a collection of data elements that is used by analyst.\n"
)
iteration 1: score = 0.9166
iteration 2: score = 0.9166
iteration 3: score = 0.9166
